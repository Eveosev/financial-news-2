Earnings for Capesize ships that haul
iron ore slowed down as an oversupply of vessels persisted.  Daily average returns for the largest commodity carriers
increased 1 percent to $7,983, figures from the London-based
Baltic Exchange showed today. Rates jumped 98 percent over the
prior week through to July 6, according to the exchange. It’s
the 15th consecutive increase, the data show.  Owners have idled vessels on some routes, curbing the
supply of available ships and increasing returns for owners,
according to an e-mailed report from Oslo-based Fearnley
Securities analyst Rikard Vabo. The total Capesize fleet
expanded by 23 percent from the start of the year to 1,464
vessels as of July 6, according to  IHS Inc. (IHS) , an Englewood,
Colorado-based research company.  “Capesize activity has picked up somewhat, and as a result
of many owners idling tonnage recently the balance has improved
somewhat,” Vabo wrote in the report today. Still, “the market
remains severely oversupplied,” Vabo said.  The Baltic Dry Index increased 0.4 percent to 1,162 as
earnings climbed for three of the four vessel types it tracks.
Panamaxes, the biggest ships to navigate the Panama Canal,
gained 1.4 percent to $9,128 as Supramaxes that are about 25
percent smaller rose by 0.2 percent to $13,587. Handysizes, the
smallest ships tracked by the index, fell 0.6 percent to
$10,250, exchange data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
