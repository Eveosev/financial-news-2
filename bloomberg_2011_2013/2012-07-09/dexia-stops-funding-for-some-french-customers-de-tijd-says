Dexia SA (DEXB) , the French-Belgian lender
thatâ€™s being broken up, has stopped funding some 120 large
customers in France, most of them local governments,  De Tijd 
reported yesterday, citing customers and a company spokesman.  Dexia has told customers they no longer have drawing rights
for existing lines of credit of up to 1.6 billion euros, De Tijd
said. Benoit Gausseron, a spokesman for the company, said it can
no longer provide new loans under restructuring overseen by the
European Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
