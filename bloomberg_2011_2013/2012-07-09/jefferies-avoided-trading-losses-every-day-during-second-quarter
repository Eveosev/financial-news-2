Jefferies Group Inc. (JEF) , the investment
bank led by Chief Executive OfficerRichard Handler, had
positive trading revenue every day of the fiscal second quarter.  Net revenue from trading exceeded $10 million on five of
the period’s 64 trading days, according to a quarterly report
filed today by the New York-based firm with U.S. regulators.  A measure of potential trading losses jumped in March to
touch the highest level in almost a year because of risks tied
to equities and  interest rates , Jefferies said in the filing.
The company’s value-at-risk climbed to as high as $18 million
before falling to $7.9 million on May 31, when the quarter
ended. VaR is an estimate of the maximum amount that traders
might lose on 95 out of 100 trading days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
