China  International United Petroleum
& Chemical Co., the nation’s largest oil trader, resumed diesel
exports last month because of easing domestic demand, according
to a company official.  China International, or Unipec, sold as much as 100,000
metric tons of the fuel for June loading and it hasn’t finalized
its plan for July yet, said the official who asked not to be
named because the information is confidential. This is the first
sale this year, said the official.  China’s diesel inventories fell for a third month to 11.09
million tons as of May, according to Bloomberg calculations
based on data from the official Xinhua News Agency. Stockpiles
of the fuel averaged 9.34 million tons last year.  Unipec is the trading division of the nation’s largest oil
refiner,  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028)   To contact the reporter on this story:
