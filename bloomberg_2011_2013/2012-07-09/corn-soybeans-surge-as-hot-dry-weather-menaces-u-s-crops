Corn rose the most allowed by the
Chicago Board of Trade and soybeans extended a rally to a four-
year high as hot, dry weather in the past two weeks eroded
prospects for output in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower of
the crops.  More than 50 percent of the growing region was stressed by
temperatures that exceeded 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees
Celsius) on at least six of the past 14 days, T-Storm Weather
LLC said in a report. As of yesterday, more than 91 percent of
the production area was dry at the topsoil level and 59 percent
was at high risk of intense stress and lower yields, the
Chicago-based analyst said.  “The threat of irreversible yield losses from Midwest
dryness” is boosting demand,  Jim Gerlach , the president of A/C
Trading Inc. in Fowler,  Indiana  said in a report. “The extreme
heat of this past week, when combined with very dry soils, has
likely impacted pollination of corn in many areas of the Midwest
with significant reductions in yield potential.”  On the CBOT, corn futures for December delivery, after the
harvest, jumped 36.5 cents, or 5.3 percent to $7.295 a bushel at
10:40 a.m. Earlier, the price soared by the limit of 40 cents to
$7.33, the highest for a most-active contract since Sept. 13.  Soybean futures for November delivery gained 3.1 percent to
$15.5775 a bushel after reaching $15.7125, the highest since
July 15, 2008.  The record high for a contract with the greatest open
interest was $16.3675 on July 3, 2008.  Soybean futures for July delivery, before the harvest, rose
2.9 percent to $16.67. Earlier, the price reached $16.795, the
highest ever for any contract.  The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  is scheduled to release
forecasts on domestic production and global supply and demand on
July 11. Traders and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News
projected smaller U.S. and world reserves.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $76.5 billion in
2011, followed by soybeans at $35.8 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
