Lending for homeowners in  Italy 
plummeted 47 percent in the first quarter as banks raised rates
and tightened credit standards, according to a study.  “The residential mortgage market has demonstrated a
progressive slowdown from the second half of 2011,” Italian
credit bureau CRIF SpA said today in a joint statement with
research group Prometeia and Assofin, a lenders’ association.  The drop compares with declines of about 19 percent in the
three months ended Dec. 31 and less than 1 percent in the first
quarter of 2011, Maurizio Liuti, a spokesman for CRIF, said by
phone. Mortgages issued for renovations and purposes other than
property purchase fell 80 percent in the first quarter.  Prime Minister  Mario Monti  passed a 20 billion-euro ($24.6
billion) austerity package in December, which included higher
property taxes. Italian banks have been retreating from the
mortgage market as the country’s recession pressured profits and
asset quality. First-quarter home sales fell 20 percent, the
biggest decline in at least eight years, to about 110,000
transactions, a Finance Ministry agency said June 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
