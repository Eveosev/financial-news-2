Crude-oil options volatility was
little changed as futures rose on speculation that a slowdown in
the global economy will prompt more economic stimulus measures
in the U.S.,  Europe  and  Asia .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 35.28 percent at 2:35 p.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , down from 35.31 percent yesterday.  “On an up move like today, volatility would normally be
down,” said Fred Rigolini, vice president of Paramount Options
Inc. in  New York . “But there was a lot of straddle buying of
September $85 puts and calls, keeping the volatility higher than
it should be.”  Crude oil for September delivery rose $1.54, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $86.37 a barrel on the Nymex, after
sliding 3.1 percent on July 6 as U.S. Labor Department figures
showed June payrolls added fewer jobs than projected.  Boston Federal Reserve President  Eric Rosengren  called the
June job figures “disappointing” and said a third round of
asset purchases, known as quantitative easing or QE3, is
possible depending on economic data. Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao 
said the downward economic pressure is still “relatively
large” and the government will intensify policy fine-tuning.
Euro-area finance ministers are meeting in Brussels on the debt
crisis.  “There’s talk of some more easing from all the world’s
economies,” Rigolini said. “The market is reacting to that and
partly it was an oversold market on Friday.”  The most active options in electronic trading today were
September $82 puts, which fell 61 cents to $2.20 a barrel at
2:40 p.m. with 1,422 lots trading. August $90 calls were the
second-most active options, with 1,368 lots changing hands as
they gained 12 cents to 46 cents.  Bullish Bets  Puts accounted for 53 percent of total electronic trading
volume. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on floor
trading, where the bulk of options trading occurs.  Bearish bets accounted for 54 percent of the 147,264
contracts traded in the previous session.  August $78 puts were the most actively traded, with 8,921
lots changing hands. They rose 14 cents to 28 cents a barrel.
The next-most active options, August $95 calls, declined 20
cents to 6 cents on volume of 7,279.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts with 44,246
contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 40,500 lots and
December $70 puts with 35,612.  To contact the reporter on this story:
