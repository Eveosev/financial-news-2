Parts of the U.K. have already had
more than double the normal amount of rainfall for July and
heavy precipitation is likely to continue, the  Met Office  said.  Portions of the southern English county of Dorset have
received more than triple the normal amount of rain for all of
July, the U.K.’s weather forecaster said today on its  website .
The Isle of  Portland , forming Dorset’s southernmost tip, has had
97 millimeters (3.8 inches), compared with 34.2 millimeters
normally received in the month.  Rainfall is already more than twice the normal amount for
all of July in Devon and Cornwall, located west of Dorset;
Midlothian and Berwickshire in Scotland; and West Yorkshire in
northern England, according to the Met Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
