New Delhi’s airport rail link, the
nation’s first privately run urban train service, was shut down
for repairs until August-end after defects were found on its
civil structures following 16 months of operations.  The network halted services from yesterday to inspect
viaducts in the 23-kilometer (14-mile) line, Delhi Airport Metro
Express Pvt., a unit of billionaire Anil Ambani’s  Reliance
Infrastructure Ltd. (RELI) , said in a  statement  on its website.  The decision to temporarily suspend operations “is purely
linked with commuters’ safety concerns,” Delhi Airport Metro
said in a statement via mobile phone text message. The Ministry
of  Urban Development  expects the line to reopen by next month-
end, spokeswoman A.V. Chandra said by phone today.  The 57 billion-rupee ($1 billion) railway was opened Feb.
23, 2011. It has since carried more than 6.8 million passengers
and run 70,000 trips, according to the statement.  Reliance Infrastructure  fell  as much as 4.2 percent to 547
rupees in Mumbai trading and changed hands at 551.85 rupees at
1:56 p.m. The BSE India Sensitive Index dropped 1 percent.  Delhi Metro Rail Corp., operator of the city’s subway
system, built tunnels and other infrastructure, while Reliance
and partner, Beasain, Spain-based trainmaker  Construcciones y
Auxiliar de Ferrocarriles SA , paid for the tracks, trains and
other equipment. Reliance has a contract to run the the line for
30 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
