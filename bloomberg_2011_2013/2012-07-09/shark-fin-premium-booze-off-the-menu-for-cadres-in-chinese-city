A Chinese city where slowing growth
has spurred dozens of suicides, bankruptcies and disappearances
by local businessmen barred officials from expensing shark-fin
soup and high-end liquor in a bid to end lavish banquets.  “Official receptions are criticized by the whole
society,” the Wenzhou city Commission for Discipline Inspection
 said  in a statement on its website July 5. “It has become a
common practice to drink during lunch, to have up to eight local
officials at banquets when only one or two guests are in town.”  The Wenzhou government imposed a limit of 60  yuan  ($9.40)
per person for work-related meals. Wenzhou barred officials from
expensing abalone, shark fin, and sea cucumber. “High-end”
liquor such as that made by  Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , imported
alcohol and premium cigarettes are also no longer allowed.  Wenzhou’s move comes after the national government said
July 4 it would ban officials from consuming shark fin at
government expense within three years. The move is the latest in
a series of belt-tightening measures in the city, which saw
growth moderate to a 5 percent pace last quarter, the weakest in
at least four years.  Last month the city announced it was selling 1,400
government cars to cut costs and increase transparency. Chinese
officials spent 200 billion yuan on meals in 2004,  China Central
Television  said on its website, citing the central Communist
Party newspaper Study Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
