Commodities rose for the third time
in four days, driven by increases in corn and wheat as drought
threatens Midwest crops.  The S&P GSCI Index of 24 raw materials climbed as much as
2.3 percent as hot, dry weather in the grain-rich Midwest erodes
prospects for output in the world’s biggest grower of the crops.
Separately, crude oil jumped as a labor strike may halt all
offshore production in  Norway , Western Europe’s top exporter.  “It’s more the fear factor than anything else,” said  Dan
Flynn , a trader at Price Futures Group in  Chicago .  The S&P GSCI advanced 1.5 percent to 614.41 at 3:16 p.m.
after earlier touching 618.86. Twenty-two of the commodities
rose, led by corn, natural gas and coffee.  Corn for December delivery surged 37 cents, or 5.3 percent,
to $7.30 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. In intraday
trading the price soared by the limit of 40 cents to $7.33.  Natural gas for August delivery gained 10.7 cents, or 3.9
percent, to settle at $2.883 per million British thermal units
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures tumbled 5.7
percent on July 6, the biggest one-day drop since June 7, after
rising to a six-month high of $3.06.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery advanced 5.9
cents, or 3.3 percent to $1.8235 a pound on ICE.  Crude oil for August delivery increased $1.54, or 1.8
percent, to settle at $85.99 a barrel in  New York . Futures have
fallen 13 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
