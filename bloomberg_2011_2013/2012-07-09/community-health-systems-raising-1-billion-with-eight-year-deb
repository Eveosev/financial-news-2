Community Health Systems Inc. (CYH) , the
second-largest U.S. hospital chain, raised $1.2 billion to
refinance notes maturing in 2015 on the busiest day for issuance
in almost two weeks.  The company’s 7.125 percent bonds due July 2020, which
yield 596 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries,
helped lead issuers selling about $8.9 billion of dollar-
denominated corporate debt,  the most  since June 26, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Proceeds from the new senior debt
will be used to purchase the 8.875 percent bonds at 102.6 cents
on the dollar after a July 3 tender offer, the Franklin,
Tennessee-based company said today in a regulatory filing.  Community Health  “will continue to see stable margin
performance and maintain very good liquidity” even as its
ability to cut leverage with free  cash flow  is constrained by
higher  capital spending , Moody’s Investors Service analysts led
by Dean Diaz wrote today in a report rating the new debt B3, six
levels below investment grade.  The company sold the debt less than two weeks after the
U.S. Supreme Court decided to leave President  Barack Obama ’s
transformation of the health system substantially intact. Junk
bonds of health-care providers rallied after the ruling, which
boosted investor optimism for the industry by reducing the risk
that the companies will be stuck with unpaid bills.  The 2015 notes, also rated at B3 by Moody’s, traded at
102.75 cents to yield 7.83 percent at 4:20 p.m. in New York,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Community Health’s
bonds were the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities with 138 trades of $1 million or more.  Credit Suisse Group AG, Bank of America Corp., Citigroup
Inc., Credit Agricole SA, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan
Chase & Co., Morgan Stanley, Royal Bank of Canada, SunTrust
Banks Inc. and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed the sale, according to
the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
