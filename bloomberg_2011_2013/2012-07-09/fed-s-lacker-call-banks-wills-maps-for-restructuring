Federal Reserve  Bank of Richmond
President  Jeffrey Lacker  said he expects the breakup plans filed
last week by the largest banks will show U.S. regulators how the
firms should be streamlined.  “I think that’s the way to find out if they’re too big to
fail,” Lacker, 56, said today in a Bloomberg Radio interview.
If the so-called living wills can’t, as required by the 2010
Dodd-Frank Act, get a bank safely and quickly into a bankruptcy
process, “then those plans would tell you.”  The plans filed to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and
Federal Reserve by nine of the largest banks including  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  and  Bank of America Corp . are meant to help
regulators prevent shakeups to the financial system such as in
the 2008 credit crisis.  The plans’ outlines of how each bank’s legal entities are
interconnected will help the institutions see “things they
could clean up that would make resolution more
straightforward,” the Richmond Fed leader said in an interview
on “The Hays Advantage” with  Kathleen Hays .  To contact the reporters on this story:
