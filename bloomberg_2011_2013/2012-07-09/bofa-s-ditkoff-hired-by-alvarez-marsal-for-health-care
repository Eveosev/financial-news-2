Charlie Ditkoff, a  Bank of America
Corp. (BAC)  executive who specialized in the health care industry, was
hired by restructuring firm Alvarez & Marsal as President Barack Obama’s medical-insurance law takes effect.  Ditkoff, 50, joined A&M as a senior adviser, the New York-
based company said today in a statement. He previously worked as
head of global health care corporate and investment banking at
Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  The U.S. Supreme Court last month upheld the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act, which requires Americans to
get insurance or pay a penalty. Ditkoff’s experience at Bank of
America and earlier work focusing on health-industry deals at
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  and  Credit Suisse First Boston , “significantly
augments our global offerings,” A&M co-Chief Executive Officer
 Bryan Marsal  said in the statement.  Ditkoff said he has covered the industry for almost 20
years and helped health care firms make decisions about which
businesses to enter.  “I have a pretty good idea of how the companies are
thinking about the future of health care, and knowing how
companies think will be relevant for all of Alvarez’s clients,”
he said in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
