Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) , the U.K.’s
second-smallest publicly traded homebuilder by market value,
said first-half home sales increased 18 percent and its margin
widened as the company sold more expensive properties.  Bovis delivered 944 homes in the six months through June
compared with 801 a year earlier, the Longfield, England-based
company said in a statement today. The average selling price
rose 1 percent to 164,400 pounds ($254,600) after Bovis focused
on houses rather than apartments.  “The group has performed strongly, in line with
expectations, in the first half of 2012 with a significant
improvement in profit delivered from the ongoing successful
execution of the group’s growth strategy,” Chief Executive
Officer David Ritchie said in the statement.  U.K. homebuilders have boosted revenue and share prices
amid curbed mortgage lending and property values that have been
little changed after favoring margin growth over volume. British
 house prices  rose for a second month in June, according to
Halifax, a mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  The gross margin for Bovis’s homes rose to about 21 percent
in the first half from 20.1 percent a year earlier, according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
