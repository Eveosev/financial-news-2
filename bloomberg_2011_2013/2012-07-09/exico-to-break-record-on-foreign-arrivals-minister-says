Mexico  expects to set a record this
year with at least 24.6 million foreign tourist visits, Tourism
Secretary Gloria Guevara said.  Foreigners’ arrivals should increase by more than 5 percent
from the 23.4 million visits received in 2011, Guevara said July
6 in an interview at Bloomberg’s Mexico City offices. “We’re
also going to have a better number in hotel occupancy,” Guevara
said, without providing further details.  Latin America ’s second-largest economy seeks to become
among the top five international tourist destinations by 2018.
The country currently  ranks  10th, according to the United
Nations World Tourism Organization.  “We’re on track” to reach that goal, Guevara said.  Mexico’s travel industry is recovering after being hit by
concerns about violence associated with drug trafficking, and
the 2009 outbreak of H1N1 flu.  Guevara, who became the Tourism Minister in March 2010,
said that this year Mexico will also register its highest
revenue from tourism on record.  International tourism is the fifth-largest source of
foreign revenue, the Mexican Mining Chamber said in a May
report. Guevara said last year that Mexico expected 50 million
tourist arrivals and $40 billion in income from the industry in
2018.  -- Editor: Jonathan Roeder  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
