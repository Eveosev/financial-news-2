The Organization for Security and
Cooperation in  Europe  reiterated its call for  Azerbaijan  and
Armenia to stop using force and withdraw snipers from the cease-
fire line as the Azeri Ministry of Defense said two of its
soldiers were wounded in fresh clashes overnight.  “All parties should refrain from the use or threat of
force,” OSCE Secretary General Lamberto Zannier told reporters
today in the Azeri capital, Baku. “They should abstain from
retaliatory measures, remove snipers and implement the agreed
confidence-building measures, including the mechanism for
investigating incidents on the front lines.”  The Azeri Defense Ministry said in an e-mailed statement
that two soldiers were wounded in the western district of
Agstafa bordering Armenia. At least 10 people from both sides
were killed last month.  Azeri Foreign Minister Elmar Mammadyarov, speaking at the
same press conference, said that  Armenia  must withdraw from
Azerbaijan’s internationally recognized territory before the
sides agree on a mechanism to probe incidents along the cease-
fire line.  “At the heart of the problem is the occupation,”
Mammadyarov said. “If Armenia pulls its troops out, there will
be no need for a mechanism to investigate incidents.”  Armenians seized Nagorno-Karabakh and seven adjacent
districts from Azerbaijan in a war that killed 30,000 people and
displaced more than a million before a cease-fire agreement was
brokered by Russia in 1994. The sides have yet sign a peace
accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
