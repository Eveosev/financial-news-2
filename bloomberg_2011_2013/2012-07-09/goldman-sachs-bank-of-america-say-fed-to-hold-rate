Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of
America Corp. say a weaker-than-forecast June jobs gain in the
U.S. will lead the  Federal Reserve  to keep its benchmark
 interest rate  at almost zero until the middle of 2015.  The Fed, which has pledged to hold the rate low through at
least late 2014, will amend its so-called forward guidance
before deciding on a new round of bond purchases, according to
the companies. Goldman Sachs and Bank of America are two of the
21 primary dealers that trade directly with the central bank.  “The ‘late 2014’ formulation has now ‘aged’ by six months
since it was first adopted, but the economy still looks no
better,”  Jan Hatzius , the chief economist at Goldman Sachs in
 New York , wrote in a report yesterday. The central bank may
announce the change as soon as its next policy meeting July 31
to Aug. 1, Hatzius wrote.  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  faces jobs growth that slowed in
the second quarter to one-third the pace of the prior three
months. The gain in June was 80,000, the Labor Department
reported July 6, versus 100,000 projected by a Bloomberg News
survey of economists. Bernanke hasn’t ruled out more bond
purchases, and he said June 20 that more easing probably will be
needed unless there is “sustained improvement in the labor
market.”  Asset Purchases  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of securities in two rounds of
so-called quantitative easing, known as QE1 and QE2, from 2008
to 2011 to support the economy. In September it embarked on a
plan to replace $400 billion of short-maturity Treasuries in its
portfolio with longer-term debt to cap long-term borrowing
costs. It expanded the effort, known as Operation Twist, on June
20 by $267 billion and extended it until year-end.  The policy setting  Federal Open Market Committee  will
probably implement a new round of asset purchases when Operation
Twist ends, according to Hatzius.  Data on retail sales, industrial production and orders for
durable goods will determine when the Fed acts,  Michelle Meyer 
and Joshua Dennerlein, economists at Bank of America in New
York, wrote in their report July 6.  “In our view, the next step is to push out the forward
guidance from late-2014 to mid-2015, followed by further asset
purchases of $500 billion,” the economists said.  Yields Drop  Benchmark 10-year Treasury  yields  declined one basis point
today to 1.54 percent as of 7:20 a.m. in  London , according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader data. They are approaching the all-time
low of 1.44 percent set June 1. The price of the 1.75 percent
security due in May 2022 rose 3/32, or 94 cents per $1,000 face
amount, to 101 30/32.  The difference between the Fed’s target for overnight bank
lending, known as the funds rate, and five-year yields is
shrinking. The  spread  has narrowed to 38 basis points from this
year’s high of 94 basis points in March. The gap was 37 basis
points on June 1, the least since 2008.  The  difference  between the Fed rate and 10-year yields
narrowed to 1.29 percentage points from 2.13 in March. Money
managers usually demand higher rates to invest for longer terms.  “Forward guidance brings down bond yields not only via a
lower expected funds rate, but also via a smaller term
premium,” Goldman’s Hatzius wrote.  Ward McCarthy , chief financial economist at Jefferies & Co.
in New York, predicts the Fed will announce QE3 at its December
meeting, unless the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe  or political
wrangling over the  budget deficit  in the U.S. curtails growth
and prompts action sooner. Jefferies is another primary dealer.  “They’re not even forecasting sustained improvement in the
labor market, so my interpretation of that is that they expect
to do more,” McCarthy said. “There’s no reason to do it now
that they’ve already put something else in place.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
