OAO Rosneft and OAO Lukoil,  Russia ’s
two largest oil producers, rallied as  strike action  threatened
in  Norway  boosted Urals crude.  Lukoil gained as much as 1.3 percent to 1,849.80 rubles,
the highest on a closing basis since March 19, and traded up 0.2
percent at 1,831 rubles as of 3:58 p.m. in Moscow. Rosneft
climbed for the first time in time in three days, up 0.2 percent
to 208 rubles.  Urals crude, Russia’s main oil blend, advanced 0.5 percent
to $98.61 per barrel, paring its decline for the year to 6.7
percent.  A shutdown of all Norwegian offshore oil and gas production
will start at midnight, cutting about 12 percent of  Europe ’s
crude output, unless unions and employers can resolve a two-week
industrial action or the government intervenes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
