Russian stocks snapped two days of
declines as crude oil, the country’s main export earner,
rebounded after dropping the most in two weeks.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose as much as 0.6 percent before trading
up less than 0.1 percent at 1,414.62 by the close in Moscow. OAO
Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel climbed 1.1 percent, while Federal
Grid Co., the high-voltage transmission monopoly, added 1.4
percent. MSCI Inc’s gauge of emerging-market stocks sank 1.1
percent to 935.42.  Crude rose 1.1 percent to $85.38 a barrel in  New York ,
paring a 3.2 percent drop on July 6, the most since June 21.
Prices climbed after energy companies and labor unions in  Norway 
failed to reach a compromise to prevent a strike from
escalating. Oil and gas account for about 50 percent of  Russia ’s
state revenue.  “Oil may provide some relief if the Norwegian strike
extends,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Troika Dialog in
Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. “The oil-price
trend will continue to amplify intraday volatility on the equity
market.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
