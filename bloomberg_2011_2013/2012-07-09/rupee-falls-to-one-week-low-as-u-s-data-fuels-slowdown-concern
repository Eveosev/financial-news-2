India ’s rupee dropped to the lowest
level in a week after U.S. jobs data missed economists’
estimates, heightening concern the global economy is slowing and
damping demand for riskier assets.  Non-farm payrolls in America rose 80,000 in June, the Labor
Department reported July 6, compared with an increase of 100,000
projected in a Bloomberg News survey. The Dollar Index, which
tracks the greenback against six major currencies, gained 1.7
percent in the past week. Indian Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ,
who took over the nation’s finance ministry last month, has
urged government officials to accelerate efforts to revive
investor confidence.  “The risk factor for the rupee is the strong  U.S.
dollar ,” J. Moses Harding, executive vice president at  IndusInd
Bank Ltd. (IIB)  in Mumbai, wrote in a note to clients today.
“Sentiment on domestic cues is yet to turn positive as delivery
of expectations is still a work in progress.”  The rupee declined 0.9 percent to 55.9350 per dollar in
Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched
56.0750 earlier, the weakest level since June 29. The dollar
will strengthen further, pushing the rupee as low as 56.50 this
week, according to Harding.  Three-month onshore currency forwards traded at 56.95 per
dollar, compared with 56.60 on July 6, and offshore non-
deliverable contracts were at 56.89 from 56.56. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
