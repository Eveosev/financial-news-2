Stork Technical Services Holdco BV,
an energy industry services provider, plans to raise a 120
million-euro ($148 million)  credit line , according to two people
with knowledge of the deal.  Stork Technical is offering to pay an initial interest
margin of 400 basis points more than the euro interbank offered
rate for the six-year revolving credit, said the people, who
asked not to be identified because the terms are private. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  The credit line will be used to help fund Utrecht,
Netherlands-based Storkâ€™s business, including potential
acquisitions and debt refinancing, the people said. The company
is owned by Arle Capital Partners Ltd.  Julie Foster, a London-based spokeswoman for Arle, declined
to comment.  Rabobank International is the agent for the credit line,
said the people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
