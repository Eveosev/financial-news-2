Canadian natural gas rose to the
highest price in more than five months as meteorologists
forecast higher temperatures in the U.S., signaling increased
demand for fuel to run air conditioners.  August gas in  Alberta  advanced 5.8 percent to the most
since Jan. 25 as MDA EarthSat Weather of Gaithersburg, Maryland,
predicted temperatures as much as 14 degrees Fahrenheit (8
Celsius) above normal for July 14-18 across the U.S. Midwest and
Northeast.  “More than anything else, it’s the weather in the U.S.,”
Karl Kriese, executive vice president of Peregrine Financial
 Canada  Inc., said by telephone from Collingwood, Ontario.
“They’re record-breaking temperatures, they’re just in a
sweatbox down there.”  Alberta gas for August delivery increased 12.5 cents to
C$2.285 per gigajoule ($2.11 per million British thermal units)
as of 4:45 p.m.  New York  time on NGX, a Canadian Internet
market. Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.  Alberta gas has fallen 11 percent this year, from C$2.58 on
Dec. 31, and risen 41 percent from C$1.625 at the end of March.  Natural gas for August delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 10.7 cents to settle at $2.883 per million Btu.  Cooler Weather  The high in Chicago on July 17 may be 95 degrees
Fahrenheit, 10 above normal, according to AccuWeather Inc. in
 State College ,  Pennsylvania . New York also may reach 95, 11 more
than usual.  “This period has turned a bit warmer across the northern
tier,” Travis Wertz, a meteorologist at MDA EarthSat, said in a
note to clients. “The resultant heat within the Midwest will be
of a lesser intensity than what has been common the past week to
10 days, but still well above normal.”  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago
dropped 6.26 cents, or 2.1 percent, to $2.9024 per million Btu
on the  Intercontinental Exchange . Alliance is an express line
that can carry 1.5 billion cubic feet a day from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas fell 0.78 cent, or 0.3 percent, to $2.5469. At
Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for California
markets, prices advanced 1.74 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.7831.  Alberta System  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet at 4:30 p.m. New York time.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.03 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 1.84 billion cubic feet.  The available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia
system at  Kingsgate  was 787 million cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.83 billion cubic feet today, or 70 percent
of normal capacity of 2.62 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy’s  British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 2.77
billion cubic feet at 3:35 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
