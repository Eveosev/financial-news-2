Alessandro Tentori resigned as head
of interest-rate strategy for Europe at  BNP Paribas SA (BNP) , two
people with knowledge of the decision said.  Julia Boyce, a spokeswoman for BNP in Paris, didn’t
immediately return calls seeking comment. The people familiar
with the resignation aren’t allowed to comment publicly on
personnel changes.  Tentori oversaw European interest-rate strategy at BNP
Paribas for three years after serving as chief of relative value
for the region. He worked as a fixed-income strategist between
2003 and 2006.  Tentori, who was based in London, joined BNP Paribas after
working for Bayerische Hypovereinsbank and Bank Austria AG.  To contact the reporters on this story:
