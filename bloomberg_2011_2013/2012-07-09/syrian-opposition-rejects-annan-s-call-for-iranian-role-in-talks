Syria ’s main opposition group
rejected United Nations envoy  Kofi Annan ’s call for an Iranian
role in resolving the country’s crisis, describing it as an
accomplice in President Bashar al-Assad’s aggression.  The Iranians “cannot be part of the solution unless their
positions change radically,” the Syrian National Council said
in a statement posted on its Facebook page today.  Iran  has stood by the regime in Syria, its most steadfast
Arab ally, since the uprising against Assad began in March 2011.
In a July 7 interview with Le Monde, Annan said that Shiite Iran
can’t be ignored as an influential ally of Syria. While Russia
has influence on the situation, he isn’t certain that events
will be determined by that country only, Annan said.  The former UN secretary-general arrived in Damascus
yesterday for talks with Assad to try to revive the cease-fire
plan he brokered in April. The uprising that began peacefully 16
months ago and evolved into a deadly confrontation has
confounded the international community, which disagrees on the
strategy needed to persuade the Syrian president, whose family
has held power for four decades, to leave.  -- Editors: Francis Harris, Louis Meixler  To contact the reporters on this story:
