Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest state-owned crude exporter, will provide all contracted
supplies to customers in Asia for August, according to buyers at
seven refiners who received notification from the producer.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will supply 100
percent of volumes agreed under long-term contracts, said the
people at refiners in Japan, South Korea, Singapore and India,
asking not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to
speak to the media. August will be the 33rd consecutive month
when  Saudi Arabia  hasn’t trimmed exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
