Researchers isolated magnetic cells
in the noses of trout for the first time, bringing them closer
to solving the puzzle of how migratory animals navigate using
Earth’s magnetic field.  Scientists for more than 50 years have known animals sense
the field, yet have struggled to determine exactly how they do
it or to what extent. The newly discovered cells contain iron-
rich crystals and have a structure that make them about 100
times more sensitive to magnetic signals than originally
believed, according to a study published today in the
 Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .  “Magnetic reception is known for many kinds of animals,
from insects and birds, to many kinds of fish and cattle,” said
Stephan Eder, a researcher at the  University of Munich ’s
department of earth and environmental sciences and the study’s
lead author. It is unclear if all animals sense the magnetic
field in the same way, he said.  The scientists exposed snout tissue from trout to a
rotating magnetic field, causing the tissue cells to spin. That
action helped identify the cells as  magnetoreceptors , the study
found.  “The method can be applied to any type of animal with
slight adjustments to protocol,” he said. “It’s an important
thing to understand how magnetic reception works.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
