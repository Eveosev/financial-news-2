ProSiebenSat.1 Media AG (PSM) , a German
broadcaster controlled by  KKR & Co. (KKR)  and Permira Advisers LLP,
fell the most in two weeks in Frankfurt after the company was
cut to neutral from buy at Citigroup Inc.  The shares fell as much as 3.4 percent, the biggest
intraday fall since June 25 and were trading down 0.55 euros, or
3 percent, to 17.6 euros as of 11:55 local time. The
Unterfoehring, Germany-based broadcaster has added 25 percent
this year, valuing the company at 3.85 billion euros ($4.73
billion), compared with a 17 percent increase in the German  DAX
Mid-Cap Index. (MDAX)   European media companies face an “opaque” outlook as
China and other  emerging markets  “appear to be slowing,”
alongside risks in Europe, while the U.S. faces “serious fiscal
challenges into 2013,” Citigroup said in a note. The bank cut
its price estimate for ProSieben shares to 20 euros from 22
euros.  “When GDP growth is below 1 percent, this usually means
that the advertisement market falls into recession,”  Conor O´Shea , an analyst at Kepler Capital Markets, said by phone
today. “ProSieben is probably the only free-to-air broadcaster
in Europe where a contraction in advertising hasn´t been priced
in.”  Of 32 analysts covering ProSieben shares, 20 recommend
buying the share and four advise clients to sell, according to
data collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
