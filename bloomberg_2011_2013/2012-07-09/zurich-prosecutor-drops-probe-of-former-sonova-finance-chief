Sonova Holding AG’s (SOON)  former finance
chief Oliver Walker is no longer being investigated by the
Zurich prosecutor’s office for  insider trading , Corinne Bouvard,
a spokeswoman for the prosecutor, said in an e-mail today.  Walker exercised his options before he learned of the sales
figures which led the hearing-aid maker to issue a profit
warning in March 2011, the prosecutor’s spokeswoman told AWP, a
Swiss newswire. Bouvard confirmed those comments in the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
