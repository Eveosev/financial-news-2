Poland ’s central bank cut its
 inflation  and economic growth forecasts for 2012-2014 as a
stronger zloty, an  interest-rate  increase in May and a slowing
expansion curb price pressures.  The inflation rate will fall to 1.8 percent in 2014, below
the central bank’s 2.5 percent target, from 2.7 percent in 2013
and 3.9 percent this year, according to updated projections in
an e-mailed copy of the central bank’s inflation report today.
The English version of the report is also available on the
bank’s  website .  The forecast helped The Narodowy Bank Polski, the only one
in the 27-member EU to raise borrowing costs in 2012, leave its
benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4.75 percent July 4, after
a quarter-point increase in May. Governor  Marek Belka  said after
last week’s decision he’s “more worried about economic growth
and less worried about inflation” than a month ago.  The central bank, which raised borrowing costs in May as
inflation topped the target for 20 months, has maintained a bias
toward tightening as consumer prices rise at the third-fastest
pace in the European Union. Poland’s economy is set to grow 2.7
percent this year, the fastest pace in the 27-nation bloc.  EU Funds  The economy has so far resisted the slowdown in the euro-
area, which buys more than half of Poland’s  exports , on “high
absorption of EU funds and a related rise in public investment,
a relatively favorable situation in  Germany  as well as on a
weakening zloty,” the bank said in the report.  “The positive impact of these factors will gradually
fade,” the bank said, pointing to expectations that the German
economy, the main buyer of Polish exports, will slow and the
zloty will appreciate as “the recently observed depreciation
was not driven by fundamental factors and was largely due to
increased aversion risk.”  Economic  growth  will ease to 2.1 percent in 2013 from 2.9
percent this year, before rebounding to 3 percent in 2014,
according to projections prepared by the Economic Institute of
the Warsaw-based Narodowy Bank Polski.  The zloty rose to 4.2394 per euro at 9:30 a.m. in Warsaw
from 4.2492 late Friday. The two-year bond was unchanged at 4.61
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
