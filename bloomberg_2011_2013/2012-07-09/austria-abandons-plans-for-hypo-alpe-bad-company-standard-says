Austria has probably abandoned plans
to transfer as many as 15 billion euros ($18 billion) of Hypo
Alpe-Adria-Bank International AG assets into a separate company
as this would widen the state’s deficit, Der Standard newspaper
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Austria had mulled avoiding a 1.5 billion-euro capital
injection into Hypo Alpe by transferring bad assets into a
company without a banking license, which therefore wouldn’t have
had to meet special  capital requirements  for lenders, the
Vienna-based newspaper said. Such a move would have boosted the
country’s deficit to 76 percent of gross domestic product from
73.5 percent at the end of the first quarter, which was “out of
the question” for the  Finance Ministry , Standard said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
