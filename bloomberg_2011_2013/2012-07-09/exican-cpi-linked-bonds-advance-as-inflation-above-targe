Mexican bonds tied to consumer prices
advanced for a fifth day after annual inflation last month
breached the ceiling of the central bank’s target range.  Yields on inflation-linked bonds, known as Udibonos, due in
December 2013 fell three basis points, 0.03 percentage point, to
0.1 percent at 4 p.m. in Mexico City, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The peso advanced 0.3 percent to 13.3552 per  U.S.
dollar , boosting its gain this year to 4.3 percent, the biggest
advance in 2012 among major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.34 percent in June from
3.85 percent the month before, the national statistics institute
said on its website today. The rate was the highest since
December 2010. Mexican policy makers, who target annual
inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent, were unanimous in
their decision to keep the benchmark  interest rate  unchanged
last month.  “The reaction in the Udibonos is to be expected when you
have a higher inflation number like this,” Aryam Vazquez, an
economist for global  emerging markets  at  Wells Fargo & Co ., said
by phone from Harrington Park, New Jersey.  Central bank Governor Agustin Carstens predicted in an
interview on July 4 that inflation will slow this quarter to
within policy makers’ target range.  The yield on Mexican fixed-rate local-currency bonds due in
2024 were little changed at 5.35 percent. The price fell 0.02
centavo to 142.15 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
