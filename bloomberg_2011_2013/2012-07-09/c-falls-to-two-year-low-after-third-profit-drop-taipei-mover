HTC Corp. (2498) , Asia’s second-largest
smartphone maker, fell to its lowest in more than two years in
Taipei trading after posting its third consecutive profit
decline.  The  shares  lost 5.6 percent to NT$304 at the close of
trading in Taipei, the lowest since March 2010. The stock was
the second-largest contributor to a 0.8 percent drop in the
benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index.  Second-quarter net income fell 58 percent to NT$7.4 billion
($247 million), the Taoyuan, Taiwan-based company reported July
6 after cutting its revenue guidance by 13 percent a month
earlier. HTC will face competition in the second half from new
models by  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  and Apple Inc.  “We do not see any turnaround opportunities for HTC” in
the second half, Laura Chen, a Taipei-based analyst at BNP
Paribas SA, wrote in report today. “We see risk on potential
product delays and competitors’ aggressive new product push,
such as new Galaxy note and iPhone 5,” wrote Chen, who has a
reduce rating on the stock.  Third-quarter revenue will probably drop by 27 percent to
NT$96.5 billion, according to the average of 10 analyst
estimates compiled by Bloomberg since HTC cut its second-quarter
guidance on June 6.  HTC is rated sell by 21 of 37  analysts surveyed  by
Bloomberg, while four recommend buying the stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
