Taiwan , which imports more than 99
percent of its oil needs, purchased more crude in June as demand
was boosted by increased petrochemical production.  Shipments rose 6.7 percent from a year earlier to 24.4
million barrels last month, the  Ministry of Finance  said in
Taipei today. The island’s oil bill last month climbed 5.1
percent to $2.71 billion, the ministry said in a statement.  Taiwan’s output of chemical materials increased 4 percent
in May from a year earlier, the Ministry of Economic Affairs
said in a statement on June 22. Production gained after
customers’ stockpiles declined, according to the ministry.  To contact the reporters on this story:
