The Spanish region of Valencia may
face default if it doesn’t receive more financial aid from the
central government,  El Mundo  reported, citing the president of
the region, Alberto Fabra.  “If they don’t give us more credit, we won’t get through
July,” El Mundo cited Fabra as saying.  The central government has already approved a 135 million
euro ($165.9 million) loan to the regional government of
Valencia so that it can meet payments this month but the region
has to make payments of 115 million euros in August and
currently has no way of doing so, the newspaper added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
