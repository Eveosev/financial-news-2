Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4)  will reach an
agreement to buy a stake in Banco BMG SA in the next few days,
newspaper  Valor Economico  reported, without saying how it
obtained the information.  The agreement would give Bradesco a minority stake in BMG
with an option to take control of it in the future, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper reported. Bradesco started talks with BMG
last week after Banco BTG Pactual SA lost exclusive rights to
buy a stake, according to Valor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
