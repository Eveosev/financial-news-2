The Atlantic basin’s storm season
may be more active than usual with eight hurricanes forming in
2011, insurer-backed U.K. forecaster Tropical Storm Risk said.  Four of those will become “major” systems, blowing at a
minimum of 111 miles (179 kilometers) an hour, the research
group said today in an e-mailed statement. Altogether at least
14 storms may blow at 39 miles (63 kilometers) an hour or more,
the level that qualifies them to be named, the forecaster said.  In a typical year the region comprised of the Atlantic
Ocean and adjoining land has 10 to 11 storms, with 6 being
strong enough to rank as hurricanes and 3 as major systems.  The U.S., which wasn’t hit by a hurricane-strength storm in
2010, may not escape this year, according to the group, which
predicted two hurricanes will be among four named storms to hit
the biggest economy in this year’s June 1-Nov. 30 season.  Tropical Storm Risk last year correctly predicted an active
season, though its May 25 call for 16 named storms to form was
short of the 19 that eventually hit the Atlantic. It also
forecast that eight hurricanes would form and 12 did.  The London-based group is affiliated with  University
College London  and is backed by the insurers Aon Benfield, RSA
Insurance Group Plc and Crawford & Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
