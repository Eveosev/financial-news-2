Alterian Plc (ALN)  Chief Executive Officer
David Eldridge is stepping down to take responsibility for a
profit warning after a licensing contract with a major partner
was deferred.  Revenue for the year to March 31, 2011 may be about 10
percent below market forecasts for 42 million pounds ($68
million) to 44 million pounds, Alterian said today in a
statement. The Bristol, England-based company added it expects
the revenue shortfall to lower profit for the year.  “The results for the year will be disappointing,
principally as a result of the deferral,” Eldridge said in
statement. “I take my responsibilities seriously and am
stepping down from my role as the chief executive.”  Alterian said it considers it likely that the contract
renewal and extension will be agreed although it cannot be
certain this will happen or of the timing. The company said it
will give further guidance on the results for the year in a
post-closing trading statement on or about April 18.  Eldridge will continue to play a role in managing the
company while his successor is recruited, Alterian said. Iain
Johnston, who had been a non-executive director, will become
deputy chairman to provide additional management support, the
company said.  To contact the reporte responsible for this story:
