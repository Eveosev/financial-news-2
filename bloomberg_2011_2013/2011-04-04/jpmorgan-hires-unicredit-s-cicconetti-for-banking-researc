JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  hired former
 UniCredit SpA (UCG)  analyst Eugenio Cicconetti to join its equity
research team covering Italian banks in London.  Cicconetti, who resigned last week after almost two years
at Milan-based UniCredit, will start his post as senior banking
analyst in mid-July and report to Kian Abouhossein, said Patrick Burton, a spokesman for JPMorgan in London.  Cicconetti, 35, covered Italian lenders including Intesa
Sanpaolo SpA, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA and Unione di
Banche Italiane Scpa at UniCredit. His “sell” rating on
Verona, Italy-based Banco Popolare SC generated a return of 42
percent in the last 12 months, according data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Before joining UniCredit, Cicconetti worked for  Dresdner
Kleinwort  as a banking analyst and for PwC Transaction Service’s
financial-business division. A native of Rome, Cicconetti has a
bachelor’s degree in economics from La Sapienza University.  To contact the reporter on this story:
