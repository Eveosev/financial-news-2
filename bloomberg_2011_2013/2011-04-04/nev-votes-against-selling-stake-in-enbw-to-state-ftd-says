The independent Neckar electricity
association (NEV) has voted against selling its stake of about 6
percent in German utility  EnBW Energie Baden-Wuerttemberg AG (EBK)  to
the state, Financial Times Deutschland reported in a preview of
an article to be published tomorrow, citing an interview with
NEV manager Klaus Kopp.  NEV doesnâ€™t want to tip the scales balanced between the
state of Baden-Wuerttemberg and OEW Energie-Beteiligungs GmbH,
which is made up of local authorities, the newspaper cited Kopp
as saying. The state and OEW each owns 45 percent of the
utility, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
