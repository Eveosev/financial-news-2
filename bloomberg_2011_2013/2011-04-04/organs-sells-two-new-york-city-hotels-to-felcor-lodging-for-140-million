Morgans Hotel Group Co. (MHGC) , a boutique
hotelier, agreed to sell the Royalton and Morgans hotels in  New
York City  to  FelCor Lodging Trust Inc. (FCH)  for $140 million to help
reduce debt.  The hotels were valued at about $500,000 per room, New
York-based Morgans said in a statement today. The company, which
expects $100 million in net proceeds from the sale, will
continue to manage both properties under a 15-year agreement.  “This is a terrific outcome and an important continuation
in our shift toward an ‘asset light’ business model, allowing us
to focus on higher-margin management and branding
opportunities,” Morgans Chief Executive Officer Michael Gross
said in the statement.  Morgans has been seeking to cut debt and said it would use
the proceeds from the sale to further reduce its load. The
company in October won extensions for loans backed by its Hudson
 New York  hotel in Manhattan and the Mondrian Los Angeles after
paying down a portion of the money owed on the two properties.  The hotelier will pay $37.7 million in debt with the
proceeds from the Royalton and Morgans sale. The transaction
will terminate a credit line that had been backed by the
properties and the Delano hotel in Miami, Morgans said.  FelCor, an Irving, Texas-based real estate investment
trust, said in a separate statement that it expects to complete
the deal in the second quarter. The Royalton and Morgans hotels
will be the company’s first properties in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
