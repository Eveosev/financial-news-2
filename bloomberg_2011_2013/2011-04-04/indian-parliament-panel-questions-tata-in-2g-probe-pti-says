An Indian parliamentary committee
probing the allocation of 2G mobile-phone licenses questioned
Tata Group Chairman  Ratan Tata , Press Trust of India reported
today, citing panel members that it did not identify.  The committee also questioned corporate lobbyist Niira
Radia, whose tapped phone calls with politicians, journalists
and businessmen are a key element of investigations into the
2008 allocation of permits, the report said.  Federal investigators are separately probing the allotment
of the licenses after the nationâ€™s chief auditor said in a
report last year that they were sold at below-market prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
