The  New York Knicks  are headed to
the National Basketball Association’s playoffs for the first
time since the 2003-04 season.  The Knicks clinched a postseason berth yesterday with a
123-107 win over Cleveland at New York’s Madison Square Garden,
ending an 11-game losing streak against the Cavaliers.  Amar’e Stoudemire scored 28 points and Carmelo Anthony had
25 for the Knicks (38-38), who are in seventh place in the
Eastern Conference with six regular-season games remaining. The
top eight teams in each conference make the playoffs.  The Knicks have won three straight games as they target
their first winning season in 10 years.  The  Miami Heat  clinched the Southeast Division title with a
108-94 win over the  New Jersey Nets  yesterday in Newark, New
Jersey, as LeBron James had 31 points and 11 rebounds.  The Heat improved to 54-23 and pulled within 2 1/2 games of
the Chicago Bulls for first place in the Eastern Conference.  Miami, which has five regular-season games left, remains a
half-game ahead of the third-place  Boston Celtics , who beat the
Detroit Pistons 101-90.  The  Denver Nuggets  clinched a playoff berth in the Western
Conference by beating the Los Angeles Lakers 95-90 as Danilo Gallinari scored 22 points. Denver has won six straight games
and is in fifth place in the Western Conference.  The Lakers (55-21) had their nine-game winning streak
snapped and slipped 2 1/2 games behind San Antonio for the top
spot in the West. The Spurs (58-19) halted a six-game losing
skid -- their longest since the 1996-97 season -- with a 114-97
win over the Phoenix Suns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
