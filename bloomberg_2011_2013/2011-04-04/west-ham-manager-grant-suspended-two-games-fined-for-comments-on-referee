West Ham manager  Avram Grant  got a
two-match touchline ban and a 6,000-pound ($9,700) fine for his
comments about match official  Mike Jones  during his teamâ€™s 2-1
F.A. Cup loss to Stoke last month.  Grant made the comments in a post-match interview March 13.
The ban will take immediate effect, the Football Association
said today on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
