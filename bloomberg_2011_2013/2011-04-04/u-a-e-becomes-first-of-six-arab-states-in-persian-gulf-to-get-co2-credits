The United Arab Emirates is the
first of a group of six Arab states in the  Persian Gulf  to
receive United Nations-overseen emission credits.  A waste-heat recovery project won 79,960 metric tons of
Certified Emission Reduction credits on April 1, according to
data on the website of the UN Framework Convention on Climate
Change in Bonn. The other five oil-producing members of the
 Cooperation Council  for the Arab States of the Gulf are Bahrain,
Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, and  Saudi Arabia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
