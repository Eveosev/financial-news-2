Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  cut its
estimate of first-quarter U.S. economic growth by a percentage
point to 2.5 percent and said there are risks to the outlook.  “First-quarter gross domestic product was held down by
temporary factors, including poor weather,” Jan Hatzius, chief
U.S. economist at Goldman Sachs in New York, wrote in an e-
mailed note. “The risks to our second-half GDP forecast of 4
percent also remain on the downside” following higher energy
costs, tighter fiscal policy and weaker economic data.  The  U.S. economy  grew at a 3.1 percent annual rate in the
fourth quarter and the Commerce Department is scheduled to
release an estimate of first-quarter GDP on April 28. Still, the
risks are “skewed toward” an earlier interest rate increase
from the  Federal Reserve  than the first quarter of 2013 as
currently forecast by Goldman Sachs, said Hatzius.  “The basic story of good growth, low inflation and
friendly monetary policy that we have been telling since late
last year still stands,” said Hatzius. “But it’s all a little
messier than we would like.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
