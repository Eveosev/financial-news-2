Cash premiums for corn shipped in
April to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as stockpiles held by farmers dropped. The soybean basis
fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered next
month at  Gulf of Mexico  ports was 55 cents to 58 cents a bushel
above May futures, compared with 50 cents to 58 cents on April
1, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show. The average cash-
corn price rose to the highest since at least February 2007. The
soybean basis fell to 47 cents to 56 cents a bushel from 47
cents to 60 cents.  “The farmer is holding out for higher prices on his
limited inventory, and elevators are holding out for better
basis levels,” said  Don Roose , the president of U.S.
Commodities Inc. in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa .  Corn futures for May delivery rose 24.25 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $7.6025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest close on record for a
contract closest to expiration. Earlier, the price climbed to
$7.65, the highest for a most-active contract since July 2008.  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $13.84 a bushel. The price is up 47 percent in the
past year.  On March 1, corn  inventories  dropped 15 percent from a year
earlier to 6.523 billion bushels, the USDA said March 31.
Supplies held by farmers plunged 26 percent from a year earlier,
the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
