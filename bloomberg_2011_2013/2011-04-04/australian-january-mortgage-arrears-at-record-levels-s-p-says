Australian mortgage arrears jumped
to the highest in almost two years in January and will rise
further as a series of natural disasters take their toll on
homeowners,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  Loans underlying Australian residential mortgage-backed
securities that were more than 30 days behind on payments
climbed to 1.59 percent in January, from 1.38 percent in
December, the ratings company said in a statement. The level was
the highest since April 2009, it said.  While consumers remained prudent in their spending during
the Christmas holidays, “the series of natural disasters that
started around end-2010 may have had a greater impact,
disrupting some borrowers’ mortgage serviceability,” S&P credit
analyst Vera Chaplin said in the statement. “As the full impact
unfolds, and with higher  mortgage rates  and rising living costs,
we expect rising arrears in the coming months.”  Queensland homeowners had almost two months of flooding
that closed mines and damaged crops in the state’s southeast and
inundated about 40,000 properties in the capital Brisbane.
Cyclone Yasi, which tore through the state’s northeast coast
packing winds stronger than Hurricane Katrina, Cyclone Dianne in
Western  Australia  and Cyclone Carlos in the  Northern Territory ,
have all ravaged the country this year, as a La Nina weather
event dumped record amounts of rain in parts of Australia.  Mortgage arrears unexpectedly increased in the fourth
quarter of 2010 and are expected to climb higher in the first
quarter as a November interest rate increase takes effect,  Fitch
Ratings  said last month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
