NetConnect Germany GmbH, the
country’s largest natural-gas grid market area operator, said it
added three gas market areas, boosting market liquidity.  Open Grid Europe L-Gas, Thyssengas H-Gas and Thyssengas L-
Gas were merged with the NCG market area as part of a legal
requirement to reduce the number to three by April 1, NCG said
today in a  statement  on its website. NetConnect’s high-pressure
pipeline network now covers 20,000 kilometers (12,400 miles),
the statement said.  The European Union is pushing energy market liberalization
and gas-trading hubs are developing across the continent. The
aim is to make it easier to transport gas across and beyond
borders and boost competition.  “ Bayernets GmbH , ENI Gas Transport Deutschland SpA, GRTgaz
Deutschland GmbH, GVS Netz GmbH, Open Grid Europe GmbH and
Thyssengas GmbH worked together to prepare this step,” NCG said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
