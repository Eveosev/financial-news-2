Asian stocks rose, driving the
regional benchmark index to the highest level since last month’s
Japanese earthquake, after U.S. jobs grew faster than forecast
and mergers and acquisitions accelerated.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , the biggest supplier to Wal-Mart Stores
Inc., jumped 4.4 percent in  Hong Kong . Fast Retailing Co.,
 Asia ’s biggest apparel chain, advanced 3.4 percent in  Tokyo

Japanese stock.  Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN)  surged 29 percent in
Sydney after Minmetals Resources Ltd. made an unsolicited offer
of about C$6.3 billion ($6.5 billion) for the owner of  Africa ’s

said  Daphne Roth , head of Asian equity research at ABN Amro
Private Banking, which oversees about $14 billion in the region.
“Merger-and-acquisition activities are a positive sign,
underscoring the companies’ need to expand and grow their
businesses.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.5 percent to 136.03
as of 7:30 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its highest close since
March 10, the day before  Japan ’s quake. The index extended two
straight weeks of increases as Japanese companies began resuming
production after the nation’s worst earthquake on record on
March 11 and as Chinese firms posted profits that beat analyst
estimates.  U.S. Employment  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.1 percent, paring
its advance of as much as 1 percent earlier. The nation’s large

a holiday.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.2 percent
today. The index rose 0.5 percent on April 1, adding to gains

OMX Group Inc. started a bidding war for NYSE Euronext.  A government report showed the U.S. unemployment rate
dropped to a two-year low of 8.8 percent in March from 8.9
percent in February. Payrolls grew by 216,000 workers after a

takeover if it succeeds.  Bourse Operator  ASX Ltd. (ASX) , the Australian bourse operator that’s subject of

topping a rival bid from Deutsche Boerse AG.  Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd., the world’s largest-
listed exchange operator, advanced 5.3 percent to HK$180.90, the
steepest gain in Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index, after people with

first yuan-denominated initial public offering.  “Some people are banking on renminbi listings being the
next leg of growth for Hong Kong Exchanges,” said Alexander Lee,
who covers the bourse at DBS Vickers (Hong Kong) Ltd.  Wynn Macau Ltd. (1128) , a unit of the company founded by
