Midwest spot gasoline strengthened
versus futures as stockpiles of the fuel may decrease with the
approach of the summer driving season.  “It’s starting to find the season,” said Steve Mosby,
vice president of ADMO Energy LLC, a supply consultant in  Kansas
City , Missouri. It is the time to see a decrease in inventories
on the Magellan Midstream Partners LP pipeline that carries fuel
from  Gulf Coast  refineries to the Midwest, he said.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Midwest, or Group 3, narrowed 0.37 cent to 8.38 cents a gallon
versus futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
12:48 p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt
delivery rose 1.61 cents to $3.0799 a gallon.  Gasoline inventories in the region fell 312,000 barrels to
51.2 million barrels in the week ended March 30, according to
the Energy Department.  The discount for the conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
 Chicago  held at 4.5 cents a gallon. The differential was 8.75
cents under futures on March 31.  The same fuel in New York Harbor narrowed its discount 1
cent to 10.5 cents a gallon. Regular gasoline in the Gulf Coast
also strengthened 0.35 cent to a discount of 11.65 cents versus
futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
