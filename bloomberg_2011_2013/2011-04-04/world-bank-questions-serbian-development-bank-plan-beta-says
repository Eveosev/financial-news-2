Serbia should consider the
experience of other countries when planning a development bank
as such institutions rarely succeed in helping lift economies,
 Beta   news agency  reported, citing World Bank representative Loup
Brefort.  Brefort commented on a plan presented by Premier  Mirko Cvetkovic  who said the bank would not compete with commercial
lenders and would not be regulated by the central bank. Brefort
said that World Bank has seen “many cases around the world
where such institutions became means of political patronage”
and a drain on public finances, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
