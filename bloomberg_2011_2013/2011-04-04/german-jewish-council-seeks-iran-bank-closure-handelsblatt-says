Germany ’s Jewish council is seeking
the closure of the Europaeisch-Iranische Handelsbank AG for its
involvement in the trade of oil between Iran and India,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing the head of the council.  Funds flow from the Indian central bank via the Bundesbank
in Frankfurt and from there to the  EIHbank  and to Iran,
Handelsblatt said.  The newspaper said the U.S. put the bank on a black list
late last year, and cited unidentified officials in the German
security service as saying that so far there is no foundation
for assuming that the bank finances  Iran’s nuclear program .  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
