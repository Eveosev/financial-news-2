The childhood home of royal bride-
to-be  Kate Middleton  will be offered for sale at an auction
about a month after the wedding and may fetch as much as 550,000
pounds ($888,000), according to the company handling the
transaction.  The four-bedroom Victorian house in the village of Southend
Bradfield, 48 miles (77 kilometers) west of  London , will be sold
on June 3, said broker Brooke Singleton of  Dudley Singleton &
Daughter . The guide price is 495,000 pounds.  The property, called West View, is a “character country
house in a very pretty and peaceful semi-rural location,” the
company said in a statement. Middleton, 29, lived in the house
after her birth in 1982 and the building stayed in the family
until 1995.  “She did have her formative years there,” Singleton said
today by telephone. She didn’t identify the house’s owner.  Middleton has been dating 28-year-old  Prince William , the
grandson of  Queen Elizabeth II  and the second in line to the
throne, since 2003 after they met while studying at St. Andrews
University in Scotland. The couple’s April 29 wedding at
Westminster Abbey will be followed by a carriage procession past
Parliament, Downing Street and St. James’s Park.  The average price of a four-bedroom home in the area is
about 461,000 pounds, according to  Zoopla , a property website.  The  Daily Telegraph  reported the sale earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
