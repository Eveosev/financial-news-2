Guarani SA, a Brazilian sugar-cane
processing unit of  Tereos Internacional SA (TERI3) , will invest 767
million reais ($475 million) to expand crushing capacity and
boost power generation from cane waste more than fourfold.  Guarani plans to boost sugar-cane crushing capacity by 17
percent to 24.5 million metric tons in the next four years, up
from 21 million tons now, Tereos said today in a regulatory
statement. Power generation from cane waste known as bagasse
will rise to 1,172 gigawatts from 259 gigawatts, the Sao Paulo-
based company said.  The company received an 11-year, 764 million-real loan from
 Brazil ’s development bank, known as BNDES, according to the
statement. Guarani also got $560 million in syndicated loans to
refinance debt from banks including Rabobank International, BNP
Paribas, Banco Bradesco SA, Credit Agricole SA, Itau Unibanco
Holding SA and Natixis.  Tereos Internacional is controlled by Lille, France-based
Tereos. Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s Petrobras Biocombustivel unit
paid 195.4 million reais to raise its stake in Guarani to 31.4
percent from 26.5 percent, according to today’s statement.  Tereos Internacional rose 1.6 percent, or 5 centavos, to
3.28 reais at 11:22 a.m. New York time in  Sao Paulo  trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
