The  World Bank  and the  Islamic
Development Bank  plan to set up a facility to raise $1 billion
for joint Arab infrastructure projects, an e-mailed World Bank
statement said.  The Arab Financing Facility for Infrastructure, or AFFI,
will be set up by the World Bank’s International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development as well as its private-sector
arm, the  International Finance Corp. , and the Jeddah-based
Islamic Development Bank, it said.  “It will specifically target projects with a regional
dimension, linking countries with each other and with the wider
world to build pathways of economic integration,” the World
Bank said.  The AFFI will mostly focus on boosting public-private
partnerships and regional connections in electricity, rail, road
and maritime networks, it said. The AFFI will also provide the
possibility of financing compliant with Islam’ Shariah law,
which bans interest, it said.  The AFFI is due to be officially announced at a conference
in Amman tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
