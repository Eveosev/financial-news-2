ConocoPhillips (COP)  is looking at
acquisitions of deep-water and shale assets, the Financial Times
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer  Jim Mulva .  The company will increase planned capital spending of $13.5
billion by $2.5 billion this year for favourable opportunities,
Mulva told the newspaper, mentioning the Gulf of Mexico in
particular.  Conoco is looking at deep-water prospects in west Africa
and is in talks about securing exploration blocks off the coast
of Angola, the FT said.  Shale-oil assets are being sought in the U.S., Canada,
eastern Europe and China, it added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
