Five Western Balkan states aspiring
to European Union membership will offer to allow scrutiny of
their annual budget plans before they become full members in
exchange for possible backing on credit markets.  Albania, Bosnia, Macedonia, Montenegro and  Serbia  will ask
for official approval of their spending plans, Serbia’s Deputy
Prime Minister Bozidar Djelic said today in Belgrade. If the
European Commission deems them sustainable, the countries hope
to receive financial guarantees from the bloc when applying for
sovereign loans, he said.  “We are ready to show our budget plans in full, year after
year,” Djelic said after meeting with officials from the five
countries.  Serbia currently covers its  budget deficit  mostly on the
domestic market, paying “7 percent to 9 percent interest” on
three- to five-year loans “whereas with EU guarantees we could
reduce the cost of borrowing to 2 percent,” he said.  The countries will also ask for bigger financial support
before joining the bloc, Djelic said “We are not asking for
more money, we just need more support in preparation for
becoming EU members.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
