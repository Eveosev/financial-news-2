The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission may bring civil charges against Wachovia Corp. in
relation to the sale of collateralized debt obligations, the
Wall Street Journal reported.  The SEC suspects Wachovia of overpricing the CDOs, which
are a financial instrument consisting of repackaged home-loan
securities, the newspaper said, citing unidentified people. It’s
part of a wider investigation by the U.S. regulator into sales
by U.S. banks of CDOs valued at approximately $1 trillion,
according to the report.  The SEC probe of Wachovia is one of a number of issues
related to the bank since it was acquired by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) ,
in 2008 for $19.36 billion, the Wall Street Journal said. SEC
spokesman  John Nester  declined to comment, the newspaper said.  A telephone call and an e-mail to Wells Fargo in Charlotte,
 North Carolina , weren’t immediately answered outside business
hours.  To contact the reporter on this story:
