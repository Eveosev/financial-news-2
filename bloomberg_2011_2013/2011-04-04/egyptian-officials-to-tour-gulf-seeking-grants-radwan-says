Egyptian officials will tour Persian
Gulf countries seeking grants to help revive an economy hit by
the unrest that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak , Finance
Minister Samir Radwan said.  “The immediate task at hand is to broaden the fiscal
space,” Radwan said at a seminar in Cairo today. “That is why
we are looking at means and ways to get as much grants as we
could.”  Egypt has experienced near-daily protests since an uprising
that began in January and eventually toppled President Hosni
Mubarak. Economic growth has slowed as many tourists have stayed
away and factory output has been hit by strikes. The country’s
net international reserves fell for a third month in March to
$30.1 billion, the lowest level in more than three years, from
$33.3 billion in the previous month, according to provisional
data on the central bank’s website.  Countries in the Gulf and elsewhere have expressed support
for  Egypt , Radwan said. He said he would be “very happy” if
growth this year ranged between 2.5 and 3 percent, down from 5.1
percent in the previous 12 months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
