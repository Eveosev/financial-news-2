Indian stocks reached a three-month
high, extending a two-week rally, on expectations the nation’s
economic expansion and corporate earnings will withstand  oil
prices  at the highest levels in 30 months.  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , the nation’s largest motorcycle
maker, advanced for the 10th day, its longest winning streak in
at least two decades, after sales surged 24 percent to a record
in March.  Bharat Heavy Electricals Ltd. (BHEL) , the biggest maker of
power equipment, added 2.3 percent after reporting profit that
rose at the fastest pace since 2007.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  paced gains
among software exporters after saying it agreed to buy SAIC
Inc.’s information technology unit that provides services to oil
and gas companies for $150 million in cash. The country’s
economic growth has exceeded 8 percent the past four quarters.  “The auto numbers and some of the results have created a
positive sentiment; it’s sort of a pre-earnings rally,” said
Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-based  fund manager  with Peerless Mutual
Fund, which has about $1.1 billion in assets. “Concerns over
crude oil have taken a backseat for the moment.” He favors
shares of automakers, lenders and software companies.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
gained 281.34, or 1.5 percent, to 19,701.73, at the 3:30 p.m.
close in Mumbai. The index is at its highest level since Jan. 6
and today’s rally pared this year’s loss to 3.9 percent. The
gauge added 3.2 percent last week, its second week of advance.

the largest carmaker, rose 2.3 percent to 1,300.35 rupees.  Rural Incomes  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM)  jumped 4.6 percent to 744 rupees,
its highest close since Jan. 25. The top maker of sport-utility
vehicles and tractors was rated a “buy” in new coverage at Kim
Eng Securities India Pvt. by analysts Jigar Shah and Vedant
Agarwal. Growing rural incomes would support an earnings-per-
share growth of 17 percent to 20 percent over the next two
years, the analysts said in a report today, setting a price
estimate of 845 rupees for the stock.  Bharat Heavy climbed 2.2 percent to 2,173.75 rupees. Net
income in the 12 months ended March 31 climbed 40 percent to
60.2 billion rupees ($1.4 billion), or 123 rupees a share, the
company said in a statement to the Bombay Stock Exchange today.  The state-run company gives provisional annual earnings in
the first week of April every year, before announcing audited
fourth-quarter earnings later in the month.  Technology Stocks  Wipro added 1 percent to 481 rupees, while its April
futures settled at 484.65 rupees.  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) , the
second-largest software services provider, added 2 percent to
3,283.15 rupees, while rival  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) 
gained 2.8 percent to 1,213.2 rupees. Indian software companies
get at least three-quarters of their sales from abroad.  The rally in Indian equities mirrored advances in Asian
stocks, which drove the regional benchmark to the highest level
since last month’s earthquake in  Japan  as U.S. jobs grew faster
than forecast. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.6 percent.  Crude for May delivery jumped as much as 0.8 percent to
$108.78 a barrel in  New York , the highest price since September
2008, on speculation fuel demand may increase in the U.S., the
biggest consumer. Prices are up 25 percent from a year earlier.  National Aluminium Co. gained 2.2 percent to 98.3 rupees.
The nation’s second-biggest producer said cast-metal output
reached a record 443,597 metric tons in the 2010-2011 financial
year from 431,488 tons in 2009-10. The company also raised
prices by 1.8 percent, it said in a statement on its website.  Temasek  Shriram Transport Finance Co. rose 1.3 percent to 800.25
rupees. Temasek Holdings Pte,  Singapore ’s state-run investment
company, is negotiating with TPG Capital to buy the latter’s 20
percent stake in the truck financier, the Business Standard
reported, citing people it didn’t identify.  Temasek declined to comment in an e-mailed statement. Two
calls made to Shriram Transport’s Managing Director R. Sridhar’s
office phone number and an e-mail to him seeking comments on the
report weren’t answered.  Reliance Communications Ltd. (RCOM) , the second-largest mobile-
phone operator, sank 2.4 percent to 109 rupees, extending its
decline this year to 25 percent. Reliance Anil D. Ambani Group
Managing Director Gautam Doshi and Senior Vice-Presidents Hari

cell phone spectrum on April 2, according to A.K. Singh, a
lawyer for the  Central Bureau of Investigation . Reliance Telecom
Ltd., a unit of Reliance Communications, was one of the three
companies charged by investigators.  Sensex Valuation  The Sensex rallied 9.1 percent in March, the top monthly
gain since September. The gauge has still declined 5.1 percent
this year as concerns that rising borrowing costs will crimp
economic expansion. The loss is the first since a 25 percent
slump in the fourth quarter of 2008. Companies on the benchmark
trade at an average 15.5 times estimated earnings, compared with
21.5 times in March 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Overseas funds purchased a net 10.4 billion rupees ($233
million) of Indian stocks on March 30, reducing their outflow
from equities this year to 25 billion rupees, according to the
 website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of  India . Foreign
investors put a net $1.6 billion in the nation’s equities in
March after pulling out $2.2 billion in January and February.  India’s economic expansion and corporate earnings lured
foreign funds to buy a record $29.4 billion of local equities
last year and made the Sensex the best performer and most
expensive among the world’s 10 biggest markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
