Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  has finished a
turnaround at its Baton Rouge refinery in Louisiana and
operations have returned to normal, Kevin Allexon, a company
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  Allexon, based in Fairfax, Virginia, said in a Feb. 8
message that work on a fluid catalytic cracker and associated
units would last several weeks.  Catalytic crackers are the main gasoline-making units at a
refinery. The Baton Rouge plant, second-largest in the U.S.
after Exxon’s refinery in Baytown, Texas, has a fluid catalytic
cracking capacity of 243,000 barrels a day, according to the
U.S. Energy Department’s Energy Information Administration.  The Baton Rouge refinery processes domestic crudes from
Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alaska, according to the
company’s website. It also imports crude from  Mexico , the North
Sea, West Africa,  South America , Central America and the Arabian
Gulf.  The plant can process 525,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
