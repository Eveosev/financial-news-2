Palm oil  increased to the highest in
two weeks, paced by gains in corn and soybeans after a U.S.
government report showed inventories fell from last year and
soybean plantings will drop.  The June-delivery contract climbed 1.3 percent to 3,382
ringgit ($1,121) a metric ton, the highest close since March 21
on the Malaysia Derivatives Exchange. Futures gained 2.4 percent
in the week ending April 1.  Corn stockpiles on March 1 declined 15 percent from a year
earlier to a four-year low, as demand for  animal feed , fuel and
food climbed, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on March
31. Soybeans, used to make a substitute cooking-oil, rose as
U.S. farmers intend to cut the area planted by 1 percent to
76.609 million (31 million hectares), a three-year low, close to
analysts’ expectations.  “The USDA data showed farmers will cut plantings for
soybeans and that’s not surprising; what’s surprising is the
corn stocks,” Ker Chung Yang, an analyst at Phillip Futures
Pte, said by phone from  Singapore . “This will have some
spillover effect on crude palm oil as well.”  Corn advanced for a third day to the highest price since
2008 on concern that a planned increase in planting in the U.S.,
the world’s largest grower, will not be enough to rebuild
stockpiles. In the U.S., the grain is the primary ingredient in
ethanol, an alternative fuel. Palm and soybean oils are
substitutes in food and fuel uses and prices can be influenced
by shifts in energy costs.  Oil climbed for a third day in New York, trading at a 30-
month high, as signs of economic recovery in the U.S. boosted
speculation fuel demand will rise in the world’s largest crude
user. Futures advanced as much as 0.8 percent to $108.78 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange, the highest level since September 2008.  “It’s likely to be a boost factor for CPO also, because of
the biofuel uses,” Ker said. “The fight between food and fuel
is likely to get more intensive.  Soybean futures for May delivery increased as much as 0.7
percent to $14.0275 a bushel and traded at $13.98 at 8:13 p.m.
Singapore time. Soybean oil for the same month climbed as much
as 0.7 percent to 59.07 cents per pound and traded at 58.95
cents.  CME Group Inc.’s most-active June palm-oil contract, pegged
to the Malaysian benchmark, advanced 0.9 percent to $1,118.25 a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
