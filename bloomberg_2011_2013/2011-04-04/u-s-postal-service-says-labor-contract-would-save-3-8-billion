The U.S.  Postal Service , which has
reported losses for five consecutive quarters, would save $3.8
billion over four and a half years under a labor agreement with
one of its labor unions.  “We’re doing everything within our authority to put the
Postal Service on a path to profitability,” Postmaster General
Patrick Donahoe said today about a contract reached with the
American Postal Workers Union. “Labor costs are forever reduced
in this contract.”  Donahoe spoke to reporters at the agency’s Washington
headquarters the day before he is scheduled to testify before
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, whose
chairman Representative  Darrell Issa , a California Republican,
has called the contract a “missed opportunity” to cut costs.  Of the $3.8 billion in savings in the contract, $180
million comes from having workers contribute more to their
health-care expenses, Donahoe said. He said the savings won’t
cut the 80 percent of the postal budget devoted to labor costs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
