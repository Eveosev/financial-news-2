Edcon Ltd.,  South Africa ’s biggest
clothing retailer, sold 1.01 billion rand ($150.6 million) of
five-year bonds, tapping the domestic  debt market  for the first
time to take advantage of borrowing costs at a 30-year low.  The notes will pay 6.25 percentage points more than the
three-month Johannesburg Interbank Agreed Rate, which was at
5.575 percent by 3:23 p.m. The debt was placed as part of a 2.5
billion-rand domestic medium-term note program, Rand Merchant
Bank, which helped manage the issue with Goldman Sachs Group
Inc., said in an e-mailed statement. The bonds mature in April
2016.  “The proceeds will be used to fully refinance Edcon’s
super senior rand loan, maturing in 2014,” the company said.  Edcon, which is owned by Bain Capital LLC, sold 500 million
euros of 9.5 percent bonds in February. The company’s long-term
debt is rated B2 by Moody’s Investor Service, five notches below
investment grade.  South African companies sold $4.8 billion of bonds in the
busiest first quarter on record after three central-bank
interest rate cuts last year took the benchmark rate to 5.5
percent, the lowest in three decades. The monetary policy
committee left the rate unchanged for a second consecutive
meeting on March 24, as surging food and oil prices threaten to
boost inflation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
