The U.S. will build five new nuclear
reactors by 2020 and ignore calls to scale back plans in the
wake of  Japan ’s nuclear accident, said Chris Gadomski, an
analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “We’ll see a reassessment and reevaluation and then stay
the course,” Gadomski said today at a conference in  New York 
today. Plans to build the five reactors are already underway, he
said, and “We don’t see that changing.”  No new nuclear plants have been built in the U.S. since the
1979 near-meltdown at Three Mile Island. Interest in atomic
energy has gained as a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions that
contribute to global warming, and the Obama administration has
offered loan guarantees to developers of reactors, which account
for a fifth of total U.S. electricity.  “We are looking first and foremost at keeping our current
fleet operating safely,” said Andrea Sterdis, senior manager of
nuclear expansion at  Tennessee Valley Authority , a federal power
supplier that operates four reactors in the U.S. South. She
spoke at the conference hosted by New Energy Finance.  The biggest threat to new nuclear  power plants  may be the
low cost of natural gas, which can be used to fuel power
stations that are quicker and cheaper to build than atomic-
fueled facilities, said said Edward Kee, vice president of NERA
Economic Consulting.  “Everything in the U.S. is challenged by cheap natural
gas,” Kee said at the conference.  To contact the reporter on this story:
