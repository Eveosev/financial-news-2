Centrica Plc (CNA) , the U.K.â€™s biggest
energy supplier, started building a 725 million-pound ($1.2
billion) sea-based wind farm near Skegness in the northeast.  The 270-megawatt Lincs wind farm should begin producing
power by the end of next year, Julian Mears, a spokesman from
West Sussex-based Centrica, said today by e-mail.  Siemens AG (SIE)  is providing 75 turbines of 3.6 megawatts each
for the project with all of the electricity produced to be sent
to the National Grid, Mears said.  The facility is being funded through a joint venture
between Centrica, which owns half the project, and Dong Energy
A/S and Siemens Project Ventures GmbH, which own the remainder,
said Mears.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
