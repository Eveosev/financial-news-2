South Africa  will auction the
biggest amount of 25-year bonds since January tomorrow, hoping
that a yield spread near a record over shorter-term debt will
lure investors.  The 6.25 percent bonds maturing in 2036, the country’s
longest-dated debt, yield 117 basis points, or 1.17 percentage
points, more than 13.5 percent bonds maturing in 2015, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The spread, or premium investors
demand to hold the longer-dated bonds, has narrowed from 127
basis points on March 28, the widest on record. The Treasury is
offering 1.2 billion rand ($178.5 million) of the securities.  The Treasury decides on the maturity and amount of bonds it
offers at its weekly auctions after consulting primary dealers.
Tomorrow’s auction indicates that there is demand for longer-
dated securities, said Deon van Zyl, who oversees about 13
billion rand of debt as head of fixed-interest investments at
Cape Town-based Metropolitan Asset Managers.  “The curve is still quite steep,” Van Zyl said by phone.
“Shorter rates are anchored” by the expectation that the
central bank won’t raise its benchmark rate from a 30-year low
before the final quarter, making longer-term debt more
attractive to investors, he added.  South Africa’s central bank won’t be “soft” on inflation
and will try to prevent rising oil and food costs from driving
consumer prices above the upper end of its target margin,
Governor Gill Marcus said March 29.  The bank said on March 24 that inflation will probably
average 4.7 percent in 2011, up from a previous estimate of 4.6
percent, and reach 5.7 percent in 2012, compared with an earlier
projection of 5.3 percent. Inflation was unchanged at 3.7
percent in February.  The Treasury last auctioned 30-year debt on March 22, when
it sold 800 million of the bonds at a yield of 9.02 percent. It
is also selling 900 million rand of 6.75 percent bonds due 2021
in tomorrow’s auction. The results of the auction will be
announced after 11 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
