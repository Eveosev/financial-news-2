Services run by English local
authorities costing 6 billion pounds ($9.7 billion) will be
reduced or eliminated in the 2011-12 financial year because of
government spending cuts, the Financial Times reported, citing
its own investigation.  The newspaper analysed more than 750 million pounds of cuts
in 20 councils and extrapolated the results nationally.  The bulk of the cuts will be in care services for children
and elderly people, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
