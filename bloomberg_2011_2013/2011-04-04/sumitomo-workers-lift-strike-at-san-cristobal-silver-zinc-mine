Sumitomo Corp. workers at the
company’s silver, zinc and lead mine in  Bolivia  lifted a 12-day
strike and agreed to start talks, the mining ministry said on
its website.  The San Cristobal mine, unionized workers and members of
local communities signed a memorandum of understanding on April
2, the ministry said. The accord allows talks to begin between
Sumitomo’s unit and workers seeking changes to health-care
benefits, San Cristobal said in an e-mailed statement on April
2.  San Cristobal, in southwestern Bolivia’s mineral-rich
region of Potosi, is the nation’s largest mine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
