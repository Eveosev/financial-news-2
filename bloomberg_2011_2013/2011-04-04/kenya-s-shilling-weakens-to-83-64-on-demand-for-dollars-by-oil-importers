Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar for a second day amid increased demand for the U.S.
currency from oil importers as crude prices increased.  The currency of East  Africa ’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.5 percent to 83.72 per dollar and was trading at
83.64 at 11:06 a.m. in the capital, Nairobi. On April 4, it
closed at 83.30.  “The local unit has weakened slightly against the dollar as
demand for the greenback by oil importers picks up,” Steve
Lagat, a dealer at Nairobi-based CfC Stanbic Bank Ltd., said in
a phone interview.  Oil climbed for a third day in New York as signs of a
strengthening U.S. economy stoked bets fuel demand will rise in
the world’s largest crude user.  Crude for May delivery gained as much as 84 cents to
$108.78 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange, the highest since Sept. 24, 2008, and was
at $108.66 at 9:20 a.m. London time. Prices are up 25 percent
from a year ago.  The shilling has weakened 3.5 percent against the dollar so
far this year and is Africa’s second-worst performing currency,
after the Sudanese pound, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
