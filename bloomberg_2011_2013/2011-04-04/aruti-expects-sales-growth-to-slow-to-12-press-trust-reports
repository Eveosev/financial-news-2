Sales growth at  Maruti Suzuki India
Ltd. (MSIL) , the nation’s biggest carmaker, may slow to as low as 12
percent from almost 25 percent in the year ended March 31, the
Press Trust of India reported, citing Chairman R.C. Bhargava.  The company, in which Japan’s Suzuki Motor Corp. has a 54
percent stake, can’t have high growth rate every year, Bhargava
told reporters in  New Delhi , adding both the company and the
industry will see sales rise 12 percent to 15 percent in the
year that started April 1, according to the news agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
