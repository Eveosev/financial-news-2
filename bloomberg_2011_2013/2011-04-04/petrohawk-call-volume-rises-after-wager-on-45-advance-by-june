Petrohawk Energy Corp. (HK) ’s bullish
options volume rose to 1.6 times the four-week average after a
single block trade by an investor betting that the natural-gas
producer will soar 45 percent by June.  A block of 18,148 call options to buy the shares at $35 by
June pushed call volume to 30,911, or 12 times the level for
puts giving the right to sell, as of 2 p.m. in New York. The
shares fell 0.7 percent to $24.31 to pare this year’s advance to
33 percent. They haven’t closed above $35 since August 2008. The
contracts were bought at 8 cents, double the previous closing
price of 4 cents on March 31.  “A trader is buying a large lottery ticket,” said Joe Kunkle, founder of OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of
options-market analytics. “The name has seen a ton of bullish
options trades past few months.”  The number of outstanding calls has jumped 77 percent to
603,675 in the past month, while the level for outstanding puts
rose 6.8 percent to 127,409. That has pushed the ratio of
outstanding puts versus calls to near a 15-month low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
