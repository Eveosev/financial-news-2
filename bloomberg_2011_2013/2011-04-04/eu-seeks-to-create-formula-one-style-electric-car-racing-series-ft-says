Federation Internationale de
l’Automobile President Jean Todt said the European Commission
has asked Formula One’s governing body to create a racing
championship series for electric cars to help raise awareness
and public interest in this type of vehicle, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with Todt.  The governing body is working with commissioners to set out
electric car, go-kart and single-seater racing categories with
the possibility of staging an electric car championship on Grand
Prix circuits, the FT said, citing Todt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
