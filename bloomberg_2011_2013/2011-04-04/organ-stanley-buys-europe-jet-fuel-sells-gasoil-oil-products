Morgan Stanley bought barges of jet
fuel and sold gasoil in  Europe ’s Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp oil
hub. Gasoline rose as refiners switched their production to
produce summer-grade motor fuel.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading traded at $1,076 and $1,080
a metric ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and
brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and Platts trading
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m.  London  time That’s up from
$1,063 to $1,066 on April 1. Vitol Group, Mabanaft BV and
Cargill Inc. were sellers, while Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell
Plc, Vitol and Chevron Corp. were buyers.  Those prices are for so-called barge lots of 1,000 or 2,000
tons of Eurobob grade motor fuel, which is mixed with ethanol
before it is sold at the pump. European refiners changed their
production on April 1 to produce summer-grade gasoline, which
has a higher boiling point than winter specification.  The product’s 14 percent gain in the last month may
dissipate if high retail prices temper demand,  Olivier Jakob ,
managing director of Switzerland-based researcher Petromatrix
GmbH, said today in a note. “Prices at the pump in Europe are
already over the peaks of the summer of 2008.”  Gasoline’s crack, or premium to  Brent crude , narrowed 8
cents to $8.17 a barrel in Europe, according to data from
London-based broker PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  The spread is “increasingly vulnerable to a correction”
given rising crude prices relative to the motor fuel,  Harry Tchilinguirian , London-based head of commodity markets strategy
at BNP Paribas SA, said in an April 1 report.  Middle Distillates  Gasoil barge discounts widened to $5 and $6 less than April
contracts on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange, the Platts
survey showed. That compares with $4.25 to $4.50 on April 1.
Morgan Stanley and BP Plc sold to Mercuria Energy Trading SA,
Statoil ASA, Glencore International AG and Vitol.  Jet fuel  barge premiums were little changed at $79 a ton
more than ICE gasoil, according to the Platts survey. Morgan
Stanley and Vitol bought from North Sea Group, Gekol
Mineraloelhandel, BP and Lukoil, the trading arm of OAO Lukoil.  April gasoil on ICE gained $10, or 1 percent, to $1,010.50
a ton as of 5:08 p.m. London time. The more active May contract
advanced 0.9 percent to $1,005.50.  “ICE gasoil is moving to a greater backwardation in the
first two nearby months and that will continue to work against
holding distillates in storage,” Jakob said, referring to a
situation where prompt supplies sell at a premium to later
delivery contracts.  The rise in gasoil, used as a benchmark for diesel, may
curtail demand for the motor fuel, he said.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel barges traded at premiums of $12.50
to April gasoil versus $14.50 to $15 on April 1, the survey
showed. BP was the only seller, while Mabanaft, Vitol and Total
were the main buyers.  Residues  Low-sulfur  fuel oil  barges traded from $699 to $701 a ton,
the survey showed. That’s up from $678 to $688 in the previous
session. The high-sulfur grade changed hands from $637 to $639 a
ton, compared with $626 to $628 on April 1. Fuel oil is used to
power ships and generate electricity.  Refinery  TNK-BP, BP’s Russian venture, started planned maintenance
at its oil Ryazan refinery today, Dmitry Sergeev, a Moscow-based
spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The refinery has a capacity to process 340,000 barrels a
day of oil, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
