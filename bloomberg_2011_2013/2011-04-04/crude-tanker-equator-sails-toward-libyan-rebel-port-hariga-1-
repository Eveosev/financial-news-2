A crude tanker able to load 1
million barrels of oil is sailing toward a Libyan port
controlled by rebels, ship-tracking data show.  The Equator, operated by Dynacom Tankers Management Ltd.,
will arrive tomorrow at the Marsa al Hariga terminal, near the
port of Tobruk in eastern  Libya , according to AISLive Ltd.
ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg. The ship last
reported sailing north through Egypt’s Suez Canal.  Libyan crude output fell 995,000 barrels, or 72 percent, to
390,000 barrels a day in March, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. That’s the lowest amount in yearly data since 1962.
Exports from the country are likely to remain halted for most
of this year, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch,
Barclays Plc and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Ody Valatsas, chartering manager at Dynacom in  Athens ,
declined to comment. Dynacom is  Greece ’s third-largest operator
of supertankers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
