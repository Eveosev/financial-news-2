Rockhopper Exploration Plc , the only
oil explorer to make a potentially commercial discovery in the
Falkland Islands, surged 16 percent after saying the Sea Lion
discovery may cover a wider area than previously thought.  Rockhopper gained 38.25 pence to 276.25 pence in London.
The shares have risen more than sixfold in the last year.  The 14/10-4 appraisal well confirmed a new low case
estimate of about 516 million barrels of oil in place at the
field, of which 30 percent can be recovered, the company said
today in a statement. The well reservoir is “in communication”
with the original 14/10-2 discovery well, Rockhopper said.  “Interpretation suggests the structure now extends further
west than originally mapped but will require further appraisal
to confirm,” David Farrell, an analyst at Evolution Securities
Ltd., said in an e-mailed note. Today’s announcement is higher
than the low case estimate “prior to the first exploration
well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
