Brazilian homebuilders advanced,
pushing a gauge of shares near the highest in two months, after
Banco Santander SA said recent declines were overdone.  Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  climbed 2 percent to 14.63 reais,
leading gains for the  BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  Index. The measure
was little changed at the close of Sao Paulo trading at 4:15
p.m. New York time after gaining 0.7 percent earlier.  “Following the recent correction in stock prices, we
believe that the Brazilian homebuilding industry offers a very
interesting entry point,” Banco Santander analysts including
Flavio Queiroz wrote in a note to clients today. “Most of the
overhang is already behind it.”  The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index fell 9 percent this year
through April 1 and closed at the highest level since Feb. 1.
While homebuilders faced rising costs in recent years, the
supply of labor and materials is likely to increase, easing this
concern, Banco Santander’s report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
