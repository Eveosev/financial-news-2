The  International Monetary Fund  and
the European Commission will send a mission to Latvia tomorrow
to begin work on a country review as part of its bailout 7.5
billion-euro ($10.7 billion) loan.  The joint mission will meet with representatives from the
government, the central bank and bank regulators to discuss
budget and structural measures, the commission said in the
statement today. The IMF and EC will seek an agreement with
Latvia on terms to allow the payment of the next loan
installment, according to the e-mailed statement.  The Baltic nation turned to a group led by the EU and the
IMF for the loan after its second-biggest bank failed in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
