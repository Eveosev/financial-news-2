Old Mutual Plc (OML) , the third-biggest
insurer in the U.K. by market value, increased Chief Executive
Officer Julian Roberts’s pay by 13 percent after the company
narrowed full-year losses.  Roberts was paid 2.38 million pounds ($3.8 million) in
total compensation, including basic salary of 830,000 pounds and
so-called short-term incentives valued at 1.22 million pounds,
the London-based insurer said in its  annual report  released
today. That compares with 2.11 million pounds in 2009. Roberts
is also eligible for a long-term incentive award valued at 1.66
million pounds in his 2010 package.  Old Mutual,  Africa ’s largest insurer with listings in
Johannesburg and  London , said on March 8 its net loss narrowed
to 282 million pounds in 2010 from 340 million pounds a year
earlier after equity markets rebounded and sales increased. The
insurer last year said it may sell shares in its U.S. asset
management business and may sell its stake in  South Africa ’s
 Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  to cut 1.5 billion pounds of debt by 2012.  The insurer plans to pay Roberts 850,000 pounds in salary,
a short-term bonus of 1.28 million pounds and long term
incentives valued at 1.28 million pounds this year, Old Mutual
said. Should there be a change in control of the group, all
share options and awards held by Roberts and other employees
will vest in full, the insurer said in its annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
