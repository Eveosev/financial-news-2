Solvay SA (SOLB)  agreed to buy  France â€™s
specialty chemicals maker  Rhodia SA (RHA)  for 3.4 billion euros ($4.8
billion), seeking to expand operations in emerging markets.  Solvay, based in Brussels, said it will pay 31.60 euros a
share for Rhodia, not including a 50 cent dividend, paying 50
percent more than its last traded price. The price reflects an
enterprise value of 6.6 billion euros, the company said in an e-
mailed statement.  The new company will have combined revenue of 12 billion
euros and will generate 40 percent of its sales in emerging
markets, it said. The acquisition will add to earnings from the
first year, Solvay said.  The company sees the possibility of doubling its recurring
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
to almost 2 billion euros, Solvay Chief Executive Officer
Christian Jourquin said in the statement.  Rhodia CEO Jean-Pierre Clamadieu will be the deputy CEO of
the combined company and will take the top job when Jourquin
retires.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story
