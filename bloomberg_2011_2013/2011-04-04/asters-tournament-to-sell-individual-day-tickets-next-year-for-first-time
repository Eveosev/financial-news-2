Individual daily tickets for the
 Masters Tournament  will be available to the public for the first
time beginning with next year’s edition, Augusta National Golf
Club announced.  The sale on the Masters’  website  begins today, the private
Augusta, Georgia, club said in a news release. The exact number
of tickets available wasn’t disclosed. The majority of entry
badge holders for competition days will still be comprised of
return attendees.  Practice-round tickets for 2012 will be $50. Tournament
tickets will be $75 a day.  The club, which has hosted the Masters since 1934, moved
its entire application process to its tournament website,
www.masters.com. Tickets to individual practice rounds will also
be available via lottery on the website. Previously, those who
wanted to buy practice-round tickets had to send a letter to the
club to request an application and then mail the application to
the club.  The deadline for applying for 2012 tournament tickets is
June 30. The deadline for practice-round tickets, have been
awarded through a random lottery since 1995, is July 30.  The waiting list for competition-round tickets has been
closed since 1978. The list was re-opened briefly in 2000 and
then closed again. The 2012 Masters is scheduled for the week of
April 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
