The 10-year French breakeven rate, a
measure of inflation expectations, rose for a 14th straight day,
reaching a record.  The difference in yield between 10-year index-linked bonds
and similar-maturity conventional securities increased as much
as five basis points to 251 basis points as of 9:52 a.m. in
 London .  The equivalent rate in  Germany  also reached the highest on
record, at 239 basis points.  From May 28, 2008 through Jan. 22, 2010, there was no 
benchmark 10-year French inflation-linked bond, and therefore 
data on the breakeven rate wasn't available for that period.       To contact the reporter on this story:
