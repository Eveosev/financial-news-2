Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd., the
biggest lender by outlets in the East African nation, jumped to
its highest level in 2 1/2 years after Business Daily reported
it will open an  investment-banking  unit within three months.  The stock advanced 50 cents, or 2.1 percent, to 24.75
shillings at the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, its
highest since November 2008.  Kenya Commercial is re-entering investment banking after
selling its Dyer & Blair Investment Bank unit in 1983, Business
Daily reported, citing Deputy Chief Executive Officer Peter Munyiri.  KCB, as the lender is known, was upgraded to “strong buy”
from “buy” at Kestrel Capital (East Africa) Ltd. The brokerage
has a price estimate of 29.5 shillings on the stock, Vimal Parmar, head of research at Kestrel, said in a phone interview
today from Nairobi, the capital.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
