Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos  called on Finance Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry to seek
higher credit ratings after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the Andean
nation’s rating to investment grade last month.  Santos, who spoke today in Bogota, said he expects
investment grade ratings from Moody’s Investors Service and
Fitch Ratings within the next two months. Colombia’s credit
rating was raised to investment grade last month by S&P as
violence recedes and growth prospects improve about 11 years
after it was cut to junk in the midst of an insurgency.  “This ministry knows where it’s going and has a coherent
plan,” Santos said.  S&P raised Colombia one level to BBB-, from BB+. That puts
the country in-line with Brazil and  Peru . Moody’s Investors
Service and Fitch Ratings rate Colombia one level below
investment grade.  Santos reiterated that his  government  will have a balanced
budget by the end of his term in 2014. Echeverry forecasts the
central government will have a  budget deficit  equal to 4.1
percent of gross domestic product this year, up from 3.9 percent
in 2010, while the consolidated budget deficit will widen to 3.5
percent, up from 3 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
