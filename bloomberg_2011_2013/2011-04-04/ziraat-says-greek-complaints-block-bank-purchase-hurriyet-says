TC Ziraat Bankasi AS, Turkey’s
biggest state-run bank, complained about objections in the Greek
parliament to its expansion, saying plans to buy a Greek bank
were on hold, Hurriyet reported.  Questions were being raised in the legislature in Athens
almost every day about Ziraat’s operations, including
accusations that it’s using cheap loans to take over Greek land
and commandeer its sugar industry, chief executive Can Akin Caglar said, according to the newspaper.  National Bank of Greece SA encountered no such problems when
purchasing Turkey’s Finansbank AS five years ago, Caglar said.  Ziraat may buy three branches of  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS (HALKB)  in
 Germany , Hurriyet said citing Caglar. Halkbank is planning to
close the branches down, he said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
