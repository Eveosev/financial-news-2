U.K. Prime Minister  David Cameron 
will take over the promotion of the government’s changes to the
 National Health Service  along with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, and will launch a “listen and explain” campaign aimed
at refuting opposition claims that the alterations will
“privatize” the NHS, the Financial Times reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The U.K. government is not considering delaying or changing
the planned reforms, the FT said, citing an unnamed spokesman
for the Prime Minister’s office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
