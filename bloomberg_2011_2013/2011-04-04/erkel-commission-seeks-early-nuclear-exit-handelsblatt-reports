A commission appointed by German
Chancellor Angela Merkel wants to end nuclear power as soon as
possible,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing panel members.  One member, Miranda Schreurs, said an exit as soon as 2022
might be possible, or the country could target 2017, which would
give renewable energy a boost, Handelsblatt reported.  Klaus Toepfer, head of the commission, said  Germany  should
get out of a technology that isn’t completely “manageable,”
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
