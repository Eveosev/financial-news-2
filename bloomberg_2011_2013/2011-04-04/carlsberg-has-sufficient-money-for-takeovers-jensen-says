Carlsberg A/S, the owner of  Russia ’s
biggest brewer, has “sufficient” money to make acquisitions as
it expands in Asia, Chief Financial Officer Jorn Peter Jensen
said.  The brewer intends to “be a consolidator in the
industry,” and plans to make bolt-on purchases in  China , he
said in an interview in Copenhagen. Jensen declined to comment
on how much money he had available for takeovers. Carlsberg will
open more breweries in  India .  The company has more scope to lower costs and may close
more factories in  Europe  to do so, the executive said. Carlsberg
in February reported fourth-quarter profit that missed analysts’
estimates as sales fell and costs to make beer increased.  Shares of Carlsberg, the world’s fourth-biggest brewer,
have advanced 1.4 percent this year, valuing the company at 86.9
billion kroner ($16.6 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
