The  UN High Commissioner for
Refugees , Antonio Guterres, yesterday urged  Kenya  to permit the
expansion of residential areas for Somali refugees.  More than 314,000 Somalis currently live at three camps in
the Dadaab area in northeast Kenya and a new residential site
needs to be built to house refugees who are arriving daily, the
High Commissioner and the heads of the  World Food Programme  and
 UN Women  said in a joint e-mailed statement.  Most of southern and central Somalia has been controlled by
the Islamist al-Shabaab militia since it began a campaign
against the government in 2007, while President Sheikh Sharif’s
transitional administration holds only parts of Mogadishu, the
capital, backed by African Union peacekeepers. The U.S. accuses
al-Shabaab of having links to al-Qaeda.  Somalia hasn’t had a functioning central administration
since the ouster of former dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991.  To contact the reporter on this story:
