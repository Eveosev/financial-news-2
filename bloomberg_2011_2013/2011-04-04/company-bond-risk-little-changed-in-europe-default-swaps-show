The cost of insuring against default
on European corporate bonds fell, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings dropped 5 basis
points to 368, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at 9:30 a.m. in
 London . Thatâ€™s the lowest level since a previous version of the
index closed at the same level Jan. 3, 2008.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 0.5 to 98, JPMorgan prices show.
The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of swaps on the senior debt of
25 banks and insurers fell 2 to 132.5 and the subordinated index
was 4 lower at 248.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments fell 1 basis point to 169.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements. A decline signals improvement in perceptions of
 credit quality .  To contact the reporter on this story:
