Glencore International AG, a
Switzerland-based commodities trader, paid senior staff members
a total of $146 million in salaries and more than $938 million
in bonuses last year, the London-based Times reported, citing
information supplied by the company to bondholders.  While the company declined to say how many directors and
traders are in this elite group, a bond prospectus issued in
March last year identified a key group of 65 people; assuming
that number hasnâ€™t changed substantially, the figures suggest an
average bonus payment of about $14 million, the newspaper said.  Glencore, which is considering a share sale in  London ,
declined to comment, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
