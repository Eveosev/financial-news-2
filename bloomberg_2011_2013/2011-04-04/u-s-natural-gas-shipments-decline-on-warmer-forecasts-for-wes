Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. households fell on forecasts for higher temperatures in the
 Rocky Mountains  and the West that may reduce demand for the
heating fuel.  A sample of scheduled deliveries to homes in the U.S. and
Canada shows shipments fell 24 percent to 27.4 million
dekatherms (26.7 billion cubic feet) from April 1, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg as of 2:25 p.m. in  New York .  Residences in the West and Rockies region were to receive
5.13 million dekatherms, down 12.7 percent from April 1,
Bloomberg data show.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. power plants dropped 5.5
percent from April 1 to 11.7 million dekatherms.  The overnight low temperature in Denver may be 34 degrees
Fahrenheit (1 Celsius), 5 above normal, according to  Weather
Underground  in  Ann Arbor , Michigan. This morningâ€™s low was 19,
10 degrees below normal.  Wholesale gas delivered into CIG-Mainline, part of the
Colorado Interstate Gas Company pipeline system in the Rocky
Mountains and the pricing point for Denver, fell 36.19 cents, or
9.24 percent, to $3.5548 per million British thermal units at
1:39 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
fell 11.29 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $4.2107 per million Btu.  To contact the reporters on this story:
