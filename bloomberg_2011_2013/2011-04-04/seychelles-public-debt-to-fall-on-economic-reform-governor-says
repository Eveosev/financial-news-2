Seychelles, an Indian Ocean
archipelago, expects public debt to shrink to 50 percent of
gross domestic product by 2017 on further economic reforms,
Central Bank of Seychelles Governor Pierre Laporte said.  “We are back on track after implementing reforms and
tightening monetary policy,” Laporte said in an interview on
April 2, in Port Louis, Mauritius’s capital. Public debt has
declined to about 80 percent of GDP from 160 percent three years
ago, he said. External debt almost halved over the past two
years to 48 percent of GDP, according to the  International
Monetary Fund .  The country of 89,000 people, with a $900 million economy,
sought help from the IMF in 2008 after missing interest payments
on bonds and defaulting on privately placed securities, when
higher  oil prices  and falling tourism crimped government
revenue. Consumer prices declined on an annual basis in February
after reaching a peak of 63 percent in December 2008. The rupee
has been steady at about 12 to the dollar for the past year
after weakening to 17.34 in November 2008.  Seychelles’s structural reforms are ahead of target, with
the fiscal surplus at 9 percent of GDP last year, Laporte said.
This will decline to about 4.5 percent this year, an election
year, because of investment in “key infrastructure projects,”
he said. Gross international reserves have surged to $244
million from $11 million in the fourth quarter of 2008,
according the central bank’s website.  New Hotels  Foreign direct investment will probably fall by 54 percent
to $149 million in 2011 compared with a year earlier when
investment was boosted by property developments, including two
new hotels, Laporte said. Economic growth may slow to 4 percent,
he said.  The archipelago’s economy expanded by more than 6 percent
in 2010, the IMF said on March 17. It estimated inflation of 5.5
percent this year from zero in 2010.  Tourism is the top foreign exchange earner and employer in
the African nation, making up about 25 percent of the economy,
Laporte said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
