Cia. de Bebidas das Americas, Latin
America’s largest brewer, fell the most in a week on speculation
foreign competitors SABMiller Plc and Heineken NV may bid for a
rival beermaker in  Brazil .  AmBev, as the company is known, fell 1.5 percent to 46.09
reais at 2:15 p.m. New York time, as the Bovespa stock index
added 0.3 percent.  SABMiller and Heineken are interested in Primo Schincariol
Industria de Cervejas e Refrigerantes, Brazil’s second-largest
brewer, the Sunday Times of  London  reported, without saying
where it got the information. Closely held Schincariol may be
sold for as much as $2 billion, the newspaper said.  “This could increase competition in the Brazilian
market,” Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora in Sao
Paulo, said in a phone interview. “It’s difficult for a
Brazilian company to grow in a market dominated by AmBev. A
bigger foreign company would surely be more capable of
challenging AmBev’s position.”  AmBev accounts for about 70 percent of beer sales in
Brazil, according to the company’s website.  An official with a public relations firm that represents
Schincariol, who asked not to be identified in accordance with
company policy, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
