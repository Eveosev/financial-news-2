Wuestenrot & Wuerttembergische AG (WUW) 
plans to open a service center in Berlin, the  Financial Times
Deutschland  reported, citing an interview with Chief Executive
Officer Alexander Erdland.  Erdland said the center will be cheaper to run than those
in Stuttgart and Ludwigsburg and should help the company to
catch up with its rivals by lowering the cost of processing each
contract.  He also said he wants to increase the insurerâ€™s capital to
3.5 billion euros ($5 billion) from 1 billion euros by setting
aside profits, the FTD reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
