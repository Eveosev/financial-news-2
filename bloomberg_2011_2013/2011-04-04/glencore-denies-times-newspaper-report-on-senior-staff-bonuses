Glencore International AG, the
world’s largest commodities trader, denied a report in the
London-based Times that said it paid senior executives more than
$938 million in bonuses last year.  That figure refers to benefits accumulated by senior staff
and none is payable until retirement, an official at Baar,
Switzerland-based Glencore said today, citing the company’s
annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
