ITT Corp. (ITT)  and investment banking
firm  Nexa Capital Partners LLC  created a $1.5 billion fund aimed
at helping airlines speed adoption of a satellite-based air-
traffic control system.  Carriers would lease equipment that uses Global Positioning
System signals to pinpoint planes in flight, cutting delays,
ITT, the lead investor and an aviation-electronics maker, said
in a statement. The  Federal Aviation Administration  wants the
technology in place by 2020.  Replacing the current air-traffic control system, which
relies on radar, means buying and installing new equipment for
planes as well as for ground tracking stations.  White Plains ,
New York-based ITT, won a contract in 2007 to begin the
overhaul, a project that has been dubbed NextGen.  “All of our investors are strategic investors, in other
words, they all have a vested interest strategically for their
companies in having NextGen move ahead,” said Russell Chew,
general partner of NextGen Equipage Fund LLC. “If you are
involved in the NextGen business, whether it’s infrastructure or
avionics, you have an interest in NextGen not being stalled.”  Chew, a former executive at  JetBlue Airways Corp. (JBLU)  and one-
time chief operating officer for the FAA, declined to identify
other investors. Companies that make NextGen equipment include
ITT and  Honeywell International Inc. (HON)   Buy, Lease  NextGen Equipage Fund will use investors’ money to buy
NextGen equipment, then lease it to airlines, said Chew, who
also was a pilot and former manager at  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s  American
Airlines .  Payments would be deferred until NextGen services come
online, ITT said in the statement. The advantage to airlines is
being able to equip planes for NextGen without a large cash
outlay or adding more debt, ITT said.  Instead of using radar signals bounced off a plane to plot
its position and voice-based communications, NextGen will keep
tabs on planes with more-precise data from GPS satellites and
relay information to other planes and controllers by text
message.  With better aircraft tracking, controllers should be able
to safely put more planes in the same amount of airspace than is
possible now, easing delays, the FAA has said.  ITT’s 2007 contract, which may be valued as much as $1.8
billion, calls for building and managing about 800 ground
stations as part of the NextGen system. More than 300 have been
deployed, said John Kefaliotis, an ITT vice president.  To contact the reporter on this story:
