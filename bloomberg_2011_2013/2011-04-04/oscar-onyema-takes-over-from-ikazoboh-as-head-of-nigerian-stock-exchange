The  Nigerian Stock Exchange ’s new
chief executive officer, Oscar Onyema, started work today,
replacing former Interim Administrator Emmanuel Ikazoboh,
spokesman Wole Tokede said.  Nigeria’s Securities and Exchange Commission removed former
bourse head  Ndi Okereke-Onyiuke  in August as part of measures to
address “inadequate oversight of the exchange,” it said.
Abuses such as share-price fixing on the bourse, sub-Saharan
Africa’s second-biggest, fueled a 64 percent slump in stock
prices from the start of 2008 to the end of 2009.  The West African nation’s central bank used 620 billion
naira ($4 billion) to bail out lenders and fired chief executive
officers of eight institutions after they amassed bad debts that
posing a threat to their survival. It also set up the state-
owned Asset Management Corp. of  Nigeria  that has bought non-
performing loans from 21 of the nation’s 24 banks has bought
2.04 trillion of non-performing loans in two phases since the
end of 2010 to recapitalize the industry.  Onyema, “who opened the day trading activities by ringing
the opening bell also had a maiden meeting with the management
and staff of The Exchange,” the exchange said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Onyema joined the Nigerian bourse from the  American Stock
Exchange , where he was a senior vice president and chief
administrative officer, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
