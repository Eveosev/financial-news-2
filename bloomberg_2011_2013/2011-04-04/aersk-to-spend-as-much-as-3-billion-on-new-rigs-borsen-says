Maersk Drilling, a unit of A.P.
Moeller-Maersk A/S, plans to invest as much as 16 billion kroner
($3 billion) on new drilling rigs for the oil industry, Borsen
reported, citing Claus V. Hemmingsen, chief executive officer of
Maersk Drilling.  The division plans to expand over the next five years so
that it becomes a more significant participant in the drilling
industry, the Copenhagen newspaper said, citing Hemmingsen. The
unit currently has three percent of the global market for
offshore drilling platforms and aims to be among "the absolute
top of the market," Borsen quoted the executive as saying.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
