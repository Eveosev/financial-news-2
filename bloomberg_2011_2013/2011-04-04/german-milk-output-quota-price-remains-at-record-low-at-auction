German  milk-production rights  traded
at a record-low level last week, unchanged from five months ago
as farmers prepare for the end of the European Union’s quota
system in 2015.  The right to produce a kilogram (2.2 pounds) of cow’s milk
in  Germany  sold for an average 7 cents ($0.10) at auction on
April 1, unchanged from November, farmers group Deutscher
Bauernverband, or DBV, said in an April 1  report  on its website.  Farmers in Germany, the EU’s biggest milk producer, trade
milk-production rights three times a year. The price of the
quota has dropped to less than a third of the 23 cents per
kilogram paid in April 2009.  Farmers offered to sell rights to produce 358.3 million
kilograms of milk, of which quota for 304.1 million kilograms of
output were bought, according to the auction report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
