Ethanol rose a third day in  Chicago 
on concern that a planned increase in sowing corn in the U.S.
will fail to rebuild global inventories, and as storms in the
Midwest threatened to delay spring planting, raising production
costs for the fuel.  The alternative fuel advanced to a 32-month high after a
government report showed shrinking inventories pushed corn
prices higher. The U.S. Agriculture Department reported March 31
that corn stockpiles on March 1 were down 15 percent from a year
earlier. In the U.S., the grain is the primary ingredient in
ethanol.  “We just matched our all-time high in corn today in the
front end of the market, $7.65 for May, and that’s equal to the
price level in 2008,” said Matt Janney, a trader at Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. in Chicago. “We’ve had one heck of a rally
in the last few days.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery advanced 3.5 cents, or
1.3 percent, to $2.715 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the highest price since July 11, 2008. Prices have risen 78
percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago rose 4.75 cents,
or 1.8 percent, to $2.6925 a gallon and in  New York  the additive
increased 4 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $2.78, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf added 6.5 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $2.805 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel rose 6.5
cents, or 2.3 percent, to $2.865.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 24.25 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $7.6025 a bushel on the Chicago Board of
Trade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
