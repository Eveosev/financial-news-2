Americans out of work more than six
months have barely benefited from the longest decline in the
country’s unemployment rate since 1994.  The CHART OF THE DAY compares the percentage of the U.S.
labor force in this situation with the comparable figure for
those unemployed fewer than six months, according to data
compiled by the Labor Department.  While the jobless rate dropped for the fourth consecutive
month in March, the number of people going more than six months
without work rose to 6.12 million. That’s more than four times
the average since 1970, the period covered in the chart.  Those who exceeded the six-month threshold account for only
13 percent of the drop in unemployment since December, when the
rate started shrinking. Their number fell by 206,000 as people
out of work for shorter periods tumbled by 1.36 million.  The disparity represents “a persistent source of concern”
as unemployment eases, Robert V. DiClemente, Citigroup Inc.’s
chief U.S. economist, wrote in an April 1 report that had a
similar chart.  Joblessness has decreased by a full percentage point during
the four-month streak. March’s rate dipped to 8.8 percent, the
lowest in two years, as the economy added 216,000 workers. The
increase in employment was the biggest since May, when census-
related hiring swelled the total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
