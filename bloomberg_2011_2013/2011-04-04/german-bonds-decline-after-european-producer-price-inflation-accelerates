German government bonds fell as a
report showed European producer-price inflation accelerated to
the fastest in more than two years in February.  The yield on the 10-year bund,  Europe ’s benchmark
government debt security, rose two basis points to 3.39 percent
as of 10:04 a.m. in  London .  Factory-gate prices in the euro region jumped 6.6 percent
from a year earlier, the fastest since September 2008, the
European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
