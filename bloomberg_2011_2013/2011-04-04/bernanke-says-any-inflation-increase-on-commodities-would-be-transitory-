Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said any increase in inflation resulting from higher
commodity prices will be “transitory” as long as inflation
expectations stay stable and well anchored.  The Fed needs to monitor inflation expectations “extremely
closely,” and commodity prices are being driven mainly by
global supply and demand, Bernanke said in response to questions
after a speech today in Stone Mountain,  Georgia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
