OAO Lukoil, Russia’s second-largest
oil producer, suspended operations in the  Ivory Coast  after the
West African nation was rocked by election-related violence.  Lukoil’s overseas unit declared force majeure at its
offshore CI-205 venture and said it will only “resume active
operations” when the violence subsides, according to a
statement today.  Forces loyal to President-elect Alassane Ouattara have been
locked in conflict with incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo. The
 United Nations  has called on Gbagbo to hand over power to
Ouattara, whom it recognizes as the winner of a Nov. 28
election.  Lukoil plans to drill as many as 10 exploration deepwater
wells off Ivory Coast and Ghana by 2013. The company and its
partners drilled two wells in the region last year, Lukoil said
in a presentation on its website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
