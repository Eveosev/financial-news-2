Evergrande Real Estate Group Ltd. (3333) ,
China’s second-biggest developer by sales volume last year, rose
to a record after Shanghai Daily reported it extended its lead
by selling the most apartments in the first quarter.  The stock rose as much as 8.3 percent and was 5.7 percent
higher at HK$4.84 at 11:15 a.m. in Hong Kong trading. The shares
have risen 28 percent this year, compared with the 4.5 percent
increase in the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   Evergrande sold 2.9 million square meters (31 million
square foot) of apartments in the first three months of the year,
the most among Chinese developers in terms of floor area, the
English-language newspaper reported on April 2.  China  Vanke Co.
had sales worth 32 billion yuan ($4.9 billion) during the same
period, remaining the biggest developer by sale value, the
newspaper said.  Evergrande last week posted a sevenfold increase in 2010
profit as the company diversified away from major cities, which
are among the most affected by the government’s housing measures
targeting speculators. Net income climbed to 7.6 billion yuan
from 1.1 billion yuan, higher than the 5.9 billion yuan average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The Chinese government is intensifying efforts to keep
housing affordable after prices gained for 19 consecutive months
to December and climbed in 68 of 70 cities the government
monitored in January and February. About 40 cities said they
will cap new  home prices  below annual economic and disposable
per-capita income growth after local governments were ordered to
submit home price control targets by the end of March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
