The euro fell against the majority
of its most-traded peers on concern interest-rate increases by
the  European Central Bank  will widen the divide between the
regionâ€™s weakest and strongest economies.  The single European currency snapped a four-day advance
against the dollar and a five-day gain versus the yen. The ECB
will raise its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent on April
7, from a record-low 1 percent, according to all 57 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey.  The euro fell 0.1 percent to $1.4219 and 119.53 yen, as of
8:14 a.m. in  London . The yen was little changed at 84.05 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
