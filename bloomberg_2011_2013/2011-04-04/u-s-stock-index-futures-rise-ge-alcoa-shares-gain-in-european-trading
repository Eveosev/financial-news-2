Most U.S. stocks advanced, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index higher for a second day, as
optimism about takeovers outweighed a drop in technology shares
following a report showing lower chip sales.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  rose 1.3 percent after
 Minmetals Resources Ltd. (1208)  offered to buy Perth-based Equinox
Minerals Ltd. for about $6.5 billion.  Molycorp Inc. (MCP)  jumped 12
percent as the owner of the largest rare-earth deposit outside
 China  bought most of a European producer.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) 
and  Intel Corp. (INTC)  retreated more than 1.1 percent after the
 Semiconductor Industry Association  said global three-month
average chip sales dropped 1.1 percent.  More than five stocks rose for every four that fell on U.S.
exchanges at 4 p.m. in New York. The S&P 500 advanced less than
0.1 percent to 1,332.87. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added
23.31 points, or 0.2 percent, to 12,400.03 today.  “M&A activity has been reasonably strong,” said  Peter Jankovskis , who helps manage about $2.7 billion at Oakbrook
Investments in Lisle, Illinois. “People look at that as a sign
of confidence. It’s an indication that stocks are undervalued.
In addition, the  U.S. economy  is on fairly strong footing. That
all provides support for the stock market.”  Global Deals  The  S&P 500  has risen 6 percent in 2011 as government
stimulus measures, higher-than-estimated earnings and corporate
takeovers boosted investors’ optimism. There have been 6,241
deals announced globally this year, totaling $642.6 billion, a
27 percent increase from the $506.5 billion in the same period
in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The index had fallen as much as 6.4 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 18 as concern grew about  Japan ’s nuclear
crisis and uprisings in the Middle East and northern Africa.  A gauge of raw-materials companies rallied 0.7 percent
today, the most in the S&P 500 within 10 industries. Freeport-
McMoRan, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer,
gained 1.3 percent to $55.77.  Minmetals, the Hong Kong unit of China’s biggest metals
trader, made an unsolicited offer of about C$6.3 billion ($6.5
billion) in cash for Equinox Minerals Ltd., to gain control of
Africa’s largest copper mine. Minmetals bid C$7 a share, 23
percent more than Perth-based Equinox’s closing price in Toronto
on April 1, the Hong Kong-based company said.  Molycorp Soars  Molycorp jumped 12 percent to $66.41. The owner of the
largest rare-earth deposit outside China acquired 90 percent of
Estonia-based AS Silmet for about $89 million in cash and stock
to double its processing capacity and expand into  Europe .  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  increased 0.8 percent to $20.54. The world’s
biggest drugmaker agreed to sell its Capsugel manufacturing unit
to KKR & Co. for $2.38 billion in an effort to focus on its
higher-profit business developing new medicines.  Epicor Software Corp. (EPIC)  jumped 12 percent to $12.56, the
highest price since February 2008. The supplier of business
programs said it agreed to be acquired by funds advised by  Apax
Partners  for $12.50 a share in cash.  “CEOS are spending money, they’re buying back their stock,
they’re investing for the future through capex and M&A,” said
 Jonathan Golub , chief U.S. equity strategist at UBS AG. “We’re
at all-time record cash. Companies are returning boatloads not
only through M&A, buybacks are back in an enormous way. We’re
probably half way through that cycle.”    Ford Motor Co. (F)  gained 2.6 percent to $15.55. The automaker
rose was raised to “neutral” from “underperform” at Credit
Suisse Group AG, which said first-quarter earnings could lift
stock prices. Ford is estimated to release results on April 27.  Technology Shares Slump  A gauge of technology companies dropped 0.5 percent, the
biggest decline in the S&P 500 within 10 industries. The three-
month average for global chip sales was $25.5 billion in
February, down 1.1 percent from the prior month, the
Semiconductor Industry Association said.  Intel, the world’s largest chipmaker, fell 1.2 percent to
$19.49. Hewlett-Packard, the biggest computer maker, slumped 1.6
percent to $40.34.  Nvidia Corp. (NVDA) , a maker of graphics chips,
slumped 3.6 percent to $17.55.  Chipmakers rallied after the 4 p.m. close of U.S. exchanges
as  Texas Instruments Inc. (TXN) , the second-largest U.S. chipmaker,
agreed to buy  National Semiconductor Corp. (NSM)  for about $6.5
billion, its biggest acquisition as it expands its leadership in
analog semiconductors.  The  Semiconductor HOLDRs Trust (SMH) , an exchange-traded fund,
gained 3 percent to $34.82 at 5:14 p.m. National Semiconductor
surged 72 percent to $24.27. Texas Instruments declined 2.1
percent to $33.41.  No Time to Sell  The biggest increase in profits in more than a century is
telling investors that this is no time to sell stocks, even
after the S&P 500 almost doubled from its March 2009 low.  S&P 500 earnings are poised to surpass the 2007 peak of $90
a share in the third quarter after surging from $7 in March
2009, the quickest recovery since at least 1900, according to
data from S&P and Yale University’s Robert Shiller compiled by
Bloomberg. The gap between projected 12-month profits and
average earnings over the last 10 years is set to widen the most
since 1951, the data show.  “People are more comfortable with the recovery than at any
time over the last couple of years,” said Doug Ramsey, the
Minneapolis-based director of research at Leuthold Group, which
oversees $3.9 billion and recommended buying equities four days
before the bull market started. “That’s typically when retail
investors regain courage,” and may spur a rise of up to 25
percent in the S&P 500 during the next 18 months, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
