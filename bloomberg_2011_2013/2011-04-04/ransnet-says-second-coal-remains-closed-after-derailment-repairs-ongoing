Transnet Ltd., the state-owned South
African ports and freight rail operator, said one of two lines
carrying coal to the Richards Bay Coal Terminal remains closed
after a derailment last week.  The company is working to repair the line and should be
able to provide an update on April 6, Sandile Simelane, the
spokesman for Johannesburg-based Transnet, said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
