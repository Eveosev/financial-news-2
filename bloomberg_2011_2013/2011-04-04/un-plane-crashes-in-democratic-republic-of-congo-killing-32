A  United Nations  plane crashed today
while attempting to land in Democratic Republic of Congo’s
capital, Kinshasa, killing 32, the UN said.  Alain LeRoy, head of UN peacekeeping, told reporters in  New
York  that the plane likely crashed after missing the runway due
to heavy winds. He said there was only one survivor out of the
29 passengers and four crew members who were on board the
regularly scheduled UN flight from Kisangani.  The passengers included 24 people assigned to the UN
peacekeeping mission in DRC and five representatives of other
organizations working in the DRC, LeRoy said.  “The United Nations has and continues to play a critical
role in helping the Congolese government bring peace and
stability to the country,” State Department spokesman Mark
Toner said in a statement released in  Washington . “Today’s
tragedy underscores the risks that UN personnel undertake
worldwide. The  United States  strongly supports the UN in its
mission and will continue to do so in this difficult time.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
