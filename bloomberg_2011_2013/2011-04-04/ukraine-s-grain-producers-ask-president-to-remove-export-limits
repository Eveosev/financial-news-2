Ukraine’s grain producers asked
President  Viktor Yanukovych  to remove grain export limits.  The restrictions present “significant risks for the 2011
harvest,” Volodymyr Klymenko, the head of the Ukrainian Grain
Association, and Leonid Kozachenko, president of the Ukrainian
Agrarian Confederation producers group, said in a letter to
Iryna Akimova, the president’s first deputy chief of staff.  Exporters say the government owe them 2.5 billion hryvnia
($310 million) for value added tax credits before the quotas,
they said in the letter, published on the website of the
Ukrainian Grain Association over the weekend.  The export limits started in October last year as the
government sought to tame domestic food prices and assure
domestic supplies. They cap exports at 6.2 million metric tons
for the marketing year ended in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
