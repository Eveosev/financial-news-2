The other week I was helping the leadership team of an intriguing startup in Shanghai grapple with an interesting question: What's next? The company's core offering was coming together nicely, but it knew that long-term success required developing new products, services, and platforms. The team had tons of ideas, but wasn't sure which ones it should prioritize.  This is a common problem inside large companies as well.
