Germany faces blackouts if it
abandons nuclear power before building the technology needed for
storing electricity generated by wind and solar energy,  Die Welt 
reported, citing Fritz Vahrenholt, an  RWE AG (RWE)  manager.  Vahrenholt, who heads RWEâ€™s renewable energy unit Innogy,
said southern Germany managed to avoid blackouts since the
moratorium on nuclear plants because imports power from France
and the  Czech Republic , the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
