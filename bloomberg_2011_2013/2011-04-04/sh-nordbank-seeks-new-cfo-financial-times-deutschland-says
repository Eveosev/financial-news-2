HSH Nordbank AG is looking for a new
chief financial officer,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported,
without saying where it obtained the information.  The bank wants someone specifically responsible for finance
after recently appointed Chief Executive Officer Paul Lerbingerâ€™s predecessor held both positions.  Until then, Constantin von Oesterreich, head of risk
management, will be responsible for finance, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
