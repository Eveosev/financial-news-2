What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures are called to open 10 cents to 13 cents a bushel
higher on the Chicago Board of Trade after the government said
last week that U.S. inventories fell to a four-year low, said
 Charlie Sernatinger , a vice president at ABN Amro Clearing LLC
in Chicago.  -- Wheat futures may open 11 cents to 15 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as dry weather threatens to reduce crops in the
U.S. and  China , Sernatinger said.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT after the Department of Agriculture said that U.S.
inventories were less than the average forecast of analysts and
that acreage will decline, Sernatinger said. Soybean-oil futures
are expected to open 0.25 cent to 0.35 cent a pound higher, and
soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 higher for 2,000 pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
