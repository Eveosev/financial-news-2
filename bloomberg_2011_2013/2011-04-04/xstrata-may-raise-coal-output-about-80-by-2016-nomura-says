Xstrata Plc (XTA) , a mining company with
operations in 19 countries, may increase coal output by about 80
percent within five years to meet rising demand, Nomura
International Ltd. said.  The coal division could raise annual output to about 145
million metric tons by 2016 from 82 million tons in 2010, Nomura
wrote in a note today after analysts visited Xstrata sites in
Australia and  New Caledonia  with unit head Peter Freyberg.  India, seeking coal to fuel an expansion in power
generation, is forecast to more than double its annual imports
to about 150 million tons in 2014 from 71 million tons in 2010,
Xstrata estimates show, according to the note. Nomura projects
 India ’s imports in 2014 at 115 million tons.  Alison Flynn, a spokeswoman for Xstrata in London, wasn’t
able to comment immediately when contacted by Bloomberg News.
The Zug, Switzerland-based company is the world’s largest
exporter of power-plant coal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
