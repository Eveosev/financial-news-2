The  U.S. economy  “lost several
decades of work in this last recession,” and many states, such
as Ohio, continue to struggle with widespread joblessness, said
James Glassman, senior economist at JP Morgan Chase & Co. in New
York.  “When you get away from New York it is absolutely
painful,” Glassman said of the labor market in an interview
today on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance Midday” with  Tom
Keene . “The labor market has a tremendous amount of slack,”
and many people scoff at reports of a recovery, Glassman said.  In Ohio, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent in February
versus 8.2 percent in New York. Nevada reported the highest at
13.6 percent.  North Dakota  reported the lowest at 3.7 percent,
according to Labor Department statistics released March 25.  The recession, which started in December 2007 and ended
more than a year later, claimed more than 8 million jobs and
sent the  unemployment rate  as high as 10.1 percent in October
2009, according to government data.  In March, payrolls nationwide rose by 216,000 workers and
the unemployment rate declined to 8.8 percent, a two-year low.
Payrolls have been on the rise since October, and the decline in
the unemployment rate was the fourth in a row, according to the
statistics.  To contact the reporters on this story:
