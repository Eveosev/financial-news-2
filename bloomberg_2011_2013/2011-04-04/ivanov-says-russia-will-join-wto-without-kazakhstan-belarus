Russia  expects to join the  World
Trade Organization  later this year without Kazakhstan and
Belarus, leaving those two nations to enter at a later time,
said Sergei Ivanov, Russia’s deputy prime minister.  “Russia will be the first to join unilaterally,” Ivanov
said. “If and when Kazakhstan and Belarus would like to join
WTO, it will be very easy for them. They make their own
political decisions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
