A Southwest Airlines jet with 142
people was diverted to  Los Angeles  Sunday night after a burning
electrical odor, the New York Post reported, citing Southwest
spokeswoman Whitney Eichinger.  The unscheduled landing by the Oakland, California, to  San
Diego  flight occurred two days after a Southwest Boeing 737-300
made an emergency touch down in Arizona, the newspaper said.  Passengers changed planes in Los Angeles and continued to
San Diego, the newspaper said. The incident is being
investigated and is unrelated to the problem that occurred in
Arizona, the Post said, citing Eichinger.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
