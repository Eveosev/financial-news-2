The KazTransOil-owned Batumi
terminal in  Georgia  handled 39 percent less oil in the first
quarter compared with the same period a year earlier as volumes
were redirected to the Kulevi terminal, the operator said.  The terminal handled 1.1 million metric tons in the first
three months, Konstantin Megrelishvili, commercial manager of
Batumi Oil Terminal Ltd., said today in an e-mailed statement.
Part of TengizChevrOil’s crude volumes were redirected from
Batumi to Kulevi, also in Georgia, he said, declining to explain
why.  To contact the reporter on this story:
