Chile ’s peso surged to a three-week
high against the  U.S. dollar  as copper, the country’s biggest
export, and stocks worldwide appreciated.  The peso rose 0.3 percent to 474.5 per U.S. dollar as of
10:25 a.m.  New York  time, from 475.85 per dollar on April 1.  The peso last week broke out of a 478-484.5 trading range
where it had held for nine sessions, boosted by mining companies
selling dollars to meet payments to suppliers.  Copper, Chile’s biggest export, gained as much as 1.2
percent today in New York and stocks in  Europe  and the U.S.
climbed as takeover offers spurred optimism. China’s Minmetals
Resources Ltd. offered about $6.5 billion for copper miner
Equinox Minerals Ltd., triggering speculation of greater demand
from  China , the biggest buyer of Chile’s copper exports.  “We’re finding a new range below 477 per dollar,” said
Ronald Volpi, head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica
Corredor de Bolsa SA in Santiago. “Commodities and copper are
higher and stocks are rising, which supports the peso. At these
levels it might be time to start going long dollars again.”  Foreign investors in the forwards market trimmed their net
bet against the peso by $134 million to $2 billion on March 31
from $2.1 billion a day earlier, according to central bank data.  Chile’s benchmark interest rate may rise in line with
economists’ expectations, the central bank said today in its
quarterly monetary policy report. It maintained its forecast for
economic growth between 5.5 percent and 6.5 percent this year
while increasing its inflation estimate to 3.7 percent from 3.1
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
