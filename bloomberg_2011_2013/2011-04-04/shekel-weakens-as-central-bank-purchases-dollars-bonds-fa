The shekel, trading near the highest
levels in more than two years, weakened as the  Bank of Israel 
bought dollars to prevent an “aggressive” appreciation after
its third straight rate increase last week. Bonds dropped.  The shekel fell as much 0.2 percent to 3.4700 per dollar
after yesterday closing at the highest level since October 2008.
The currency, which traded at 3.4652 as of 4:32 p.m. in Tel
Aviv, has gained about 2 percent since the Bank of Israel raised
rates on March 28.  Governor  Stanley Fischer  raised the interest rate by a
half-percentage point to 3 percent, the first increase of this
size since 2005, putting the main rate at the highest level
since November 2008. The central bank has been buying foreign
currency since March 2008 in an effort to moderate the effect,
more than doubling reserves to $73.8 billion at the end of
February.  “The bank is intervening to prevent an aggressive
appreciation of the shekel as the economy is growing stronger,”
Rony Gitlin, head of spot trading at Bank Leumi Le- Israel  Ltd.,
said by telephone today. The bank bought “tens of millions of
dollars” when the rate was 3.4550 per dollar, he said. Central
bank spokesman Yossi Saadon declined to comment.  The economy will grow at a faster pace this year than
previously estimated, the central bank said March 30, revising
its growth forecast to 4.5 percent from 3.8 percent. Growth
accelerated to an annualized 7.7 percent in the fourth quarter
as exports, fixed investment and  consumer spending  climbed, the
 Central Bureau of Statistics  said March 10.  The benchmark Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020
slipped, pushing the yield up 2 basis points to 5.27 percent at
the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  To contact the reporter on this story:
