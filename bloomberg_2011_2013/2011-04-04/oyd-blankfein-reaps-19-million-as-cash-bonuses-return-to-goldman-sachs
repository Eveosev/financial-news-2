Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein’s $19 million
compensation for 2010, almost double the prior year, ended two
years in which the firm’s top executives gave up cash bonuses.  Blankfein’s pay included $5.4 million in cash, $12.6
million in restricted stock, a $600,000 salary and about
$464,000 in other benefits, a proxy statement from the New York-
based firm showed. Blankfein’s $9.8 million pay for 2009
included $9 million in restricted stock plus salary and other
compensation.  Cash awards are back at Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets, after a 38 percent drop in annual earnings
and a year in which the stock price ended close to where it
began. While pay is up from 2008, when Blankfein, 56, and six
other senior officers got no bonuses, it remains below
Blankfein’s record-setting $67.9 million award for 2007.  “The fact that they would return to a more market-based
pay is probably not surprising” after 2008 and 2009, said Rose Marie Orens, a senior partner at Compensation Advisory Partners
LLC in  New York . “They’re not quite back to anything remotely
like what they paid in the prior years.”  Goldman Sachs’s 2010 share performance -- a decline of less
than half of 1 percent -- outstripped competitors including  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC)  and  Morgan Stanley (MS) , which was the second-
biggest U.S. securities firm after Goldman Sachs before both
converted to banks in 2008. Shares of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,
which reported a record profit last year, rose 1.8 percent
during the year.  ‘Difficult Market Conditions’  “While our performance in 2010 was not as strong as in
2009 due to difficult market conditions for much of the year, we
continued to create value for our shareholders and prudently
manage our firm from a risk perspective,” Goldman Sachs said in
the proxy.  All 30 members of the management committee received only
restricted stock for their 2009 bonuses and four of them --Chief
Financial Officer David A. Viniar, 55, President and Chief
Operating Officer Gary D. Cohn, 50, and Vice Chairmen J. Michael Evans, 53, and John S. Weinberg, 54 -- received the same $9
million award as Blankfein.  For 2010, Goldman Sachs once again matched those four
executives’ bonuses to Blankfein’s $12.6 million in restricted
stock and $5.4 million in cash. All four also received a
$600,000 salary in 2010.  ‘Partnership Mentality’  “They’ve had a history of paying their top five like
partners,” Orens said. “It’s unusual, but it really comes from
their partnership mentality.”  The firm disclosed in January that Blankfein’s salary will
increase to $2 million in 2011 and that Cohn, Viniar, Evans and
Weinberg will each receive a $1.85 million salary starting this
year. Each of them had received a $600,000 salary since 1999,
the year the firm became a public company.  Blankfein and eight deputies reaped a total of $125 million
during 2010 from their investments in private equity and hedge
funds managed by the firm, the proxy disclosed. Blankfein’s
payments, which included profits and any return of capital,
totaled $27.2 million, outstripping his compensation.  After Blankfein, the largest fund distributions were $23.3
million to General Counsel Gregory K. Palm; $20.2 million to
Cohn; $16.7 million to Viniar; and $13.7 million to Evans. The
others disclosed in the filing were $10.9 million to Vice
Chairman Michael S. Sherwood; $6.4 million apiece to Weinberg
and General Counsel Esta E. Stecher, and $430,000 to Alan M. Cohen, global head of compliance.  Goldman Sachs’s executives stand to earn more cash bonuses
in future years under a long-term incentive plan, the LTIP,
disclosed in the proxy. The payments are contingent on two
financial measures: return on equity and book value per share.  Board’s Choice  The initial measurement period is three years and the board
can extend it through the end of 2018. The notional value of the
award for all five executives named in the proxy was $7 million,
a figure that wasn’t included in the 2010 compensation because
it won’t be delivered for three years.  For the executives to receive the awards in full, return on
equity, or ROE, must average 10 percent and book value per share
must rise an average of 7 percent, the proxy shows. They will
receive 150 percent of the bonus if the average ROE is 15
percent or more and book value per share climbs an average of 12
percent or more. The ROE target is below the firm’s long-stated
goal of achieving 20 percent return on tangible equity, which
equates to more than 15 percent ROE, over the economic cycle.  Eleanor Bloxham, president of the Corporate Governance
Alliance in Columbus,  Ohio , said Goldman Sachs seemed to be
responding to regulators’ efforts to align pay to the firm’s
longer-term performance.  ‘Paying out Cash’  “Going forward I’m pleased that the LTIP cash will include
these deferral mechanisms so that it doesn’t encourage risk-
taking and that risk measures look at longer-term horizons,”
she said. “There’s still a way to go in this year’s plan
because they’re paying out cash.”  To be sure, all of the executives own company stock worth
hundreds of millions of dollars. Blankfein owned 3.29 million
shares as of March 7, the proxy disclosed, worth $527.6 million
at the $160.23 share price on April 1. Cohn’s 1.96 million
shares were worth $313.4 million and Viniar’s 1.89 million
shares were worth $302.4 million.  The SEC requires that the company’s proxy disclose how much
compensation executives received during the fiscal year. Under
that methodology, which includes awards received during 2010 for
performance in prior years, Blankfein received a total of $14.1
million in compensation.  Goldman Sachs’s board has unanimously recommended that the
firm give shareholders a non-binding advisory vote on executive
compensation every year.  The firm is set to hold its annual shareholder meeting at
9:30 a.m. on May 6 in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  To contact the reporter on this story:
