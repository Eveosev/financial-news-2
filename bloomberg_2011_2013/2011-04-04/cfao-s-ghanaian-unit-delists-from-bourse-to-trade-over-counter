CFAO’s Ghanaian unit delisted its
shares from the country’s stock exchange after the African
distributor of goods from trucks to Viagra bought shares from
minorities, Managing Director Kofi Yamoah said.  CFAO Ghana Ltd. (CFAO)  last traded on April 1, Yamoah said in a
telephone interview today from Accra, the capital.  CFAO, which was spun off from PPR SA in 2009, bought 12.2
million shares for 486,914 cedis ($323,000) from shareholders
with smaller stakes, Accra-based  Merban Stockbrokers Ltd. , which
managed the delisting, said in a  statement  on the bourse’s
website. CFAO holds 94.1 percent of the shares in the company.  CFAO’s market value is about 7.25 million cedis and its
delisting reduces the number of companies on the exchange to 33,
Yamoah said. The stock will continue to trade over the counter,
Merban Stockbrokers said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
