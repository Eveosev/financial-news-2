Tragoolchitr Chittasaiyapan, chief
investment officer at  Thanachart Fund Management Co. Ltd. , which
oversees about 94 billion baht ($3.1 billion), comments on Thai
equities. He made the comments at a press briefing in Bangkok
today.  The benchmark SET Index gained 1.4 percent to 1,079.52 at
the 12:30 p.m. lunch break, set for the highest close since
October 1996.  On Thai stocks:  “Thai equities can still rally further because of strong
corporate earnings. Our target for the SET Index in 2011 is at
the 1,200 level. Listed companies are expected to report
earnings growth of about 20 percent on average this year.  ‘‘Therefore, our forecasted level of the benchmark index is
quite reasonable. Thai companies continue to have very high
profit growth even with high  oil prices  and the strong baht.’’  On interest rates:  ‘‘The risk to the economy is inflation. Higher prices of
oil and food will put pressure on inflation. This will prompt
the Bank of  Thailand  to raise its benchmark interest rate
further. The central bank has increased interest rates several
times. But it is not enough. There will be more interest rate
increases for the rest of this year.  ‘‘However, the central bank’s interest rate increases have
bolstered investor confidence in Thailand’s ability to control
inflation. It sends a clear signal to investors that the central
bank is serious in trying to control inflation. Prudent monetary
policies have helped attract overseas funds into the Thai
equities and bond markets.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
