(Corrects number of primary dealers in third paragraph.)  Cantor Fitzgerald LP, the New York-
based bond broker transforming itself into a full-service
investment bank, hired Mark Goldman as head of European fixed-
income sales, according to a person with knowledge of the hire.  Goldman, who started two weeks ago, had been a managing
director of sales and trading at London-based Mitsubishi UFJ
Securities International Plc, said the person, who declined to
be identified because the news isnâ€™t public yet. Most recently
he was an adviser to Zolotov Trust, a macro-economic investment
firm.  Cantor, one of 20 primary dealers authorized to trade U.S.
government securities with the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York ,
is looking to hire 100 people in fixed-income and 100 staff for
equities globally, Chief Executive Officer Shawn Matthews said
in a March 28 interview. The European fixed-income team
currently totals about 50 people, the person said.  Along with adding more staff, Cantor is looking to
underwrite transactions and Matthews said the first could come
within six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
