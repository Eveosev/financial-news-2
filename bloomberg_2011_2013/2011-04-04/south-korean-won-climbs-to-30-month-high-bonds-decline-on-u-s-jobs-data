South  Korea ’s won climbed to a 30-
month high and bonds declined after the U.S. jobless rate
unexpectedly dropped to a two-year low in March, spurring
optimism that a global recovery is gaining momentum.  Overseas investors increased their holdings of Korean
shares for a 13th day, the longest streak of net purchases this
year. The nation’s foreign-exchange reserves rose to $298.62
billion at the end of March from $297.67 billion a month earlier,
figures by the  Bank of Korea  showed today.  “The U.S. jobs report is prompting investors to buy more
stocks around the world and also spurring foreign investors to
buy Korean stocks, supporting the won,” said Ko Yun Jin,
currency dealer at Kookmin Bank in  Seoul . “At the same time,
foreign stock investors will need to buy the dollars with the
won they received as dividends and that is likely to limit gains
in the won in coming days.”  The won rose 0.4 percent to 1,086.70 per dollar as of 3 p.m.
in Seoul, gaining for a fifth day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,083.85, the strongest level
since September 2008.  The government’s benchmark three-year bonds fell, with the
yield on the 3 percent note due December 2013 rising two basis
points to 3.69 percent, according to prices from the Korea Stock
Exchange. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  South Korea  said overseas investors’ net holdings of the
nation’s bonds rose for a second month on purchases from the U.S.
and  China . Bonds held by foreign investors increased by a net
996 billion won ($917 million) to 75.3 trillion won as of March
31, South Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service said in an e-
mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
