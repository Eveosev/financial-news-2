JA Solar Holdings Co. said it agreed
to supply  Jabil Circuit Inc. (JBL)  with 400 megawatts of solar cells
during the next two years.  Jabil will manufacture JA Solar-branded modules at its
facilities in Mexico, Poland and  China , the Shanghai-based cell
maker said in a statement distributed by Globe Newswire today.  Production is expected to begin in the third quarter, and
the companies will jointly market the modules, particularly to
U.S. customers, JA said.  “By leveraging Jabil’s expertise and experience in solar
module manufacturing and strong global presence, we can further
optimize our cost structure and expand our footprint into
strategically important markets, especially in the U.S.,” Peng Fang, JA Solar’s chief executive officer, said in the statement.  Jabil, of   St. Petersburg , Florida, already produces
modules for BP Plc’s  solar energy unit  in Mexico and Poland
under an  agreement  established last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
