Spring grains in Ukraine covered 1.4
million hectares (3.5 million acres) as of today, about the same
as last year, the Agriculture Ministry said.  Spring wheat was planted on 113,000 hectares and barley was
sown on 990,000 hectares, the Kiev-based ministry said in an e-
mailed statement today. It predicted overall spring grain
planting at 7.5 million hectares.  Farmers will increase the area seeded with spring barley by
2 percent from a year ago, the ministry said. They planted the
grain on 2.75 million hectares in 2010, according to figures
from the state statistics office.  Corn sowing will expand by 3 percent this year, according
to ministry estimates. The grain covered 2.48 million hectares a
year earlier, statistics office figures show.  Total grain planting for the 2011 harvest will come to 15.6
million hectares, a 3.4 percent increase from a year earlier,
the ministry said. The government has yet to give an official
forecast for the 2011 grain crop.  The area seeded with  sugar beet  will advance by 12 percent
this year to 565,000 hectares, the ministry said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
