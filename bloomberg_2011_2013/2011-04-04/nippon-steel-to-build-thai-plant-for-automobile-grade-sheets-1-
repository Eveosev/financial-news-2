Nippon Steel Corp. (5401) ,  Japan ’s largest
steelmaker, will invest $300 million in  Thailand  to produce
high-grade steel used in automobiles to meet rising demand in
the largest auto market in Southeast Asia.  The company will build a plant in Rayong Province,
southeast of Bangkok, to produce 360,000 metric tons of
galvanized steel a year, Tokyo-based Nippon Steel said today in
a statement. The plant, beside that of its Thai unit, Siam
United Steel, will start operations in 2013, the company said.  Automobile production in Thailand will likely increase at
an annual pace of 5 percent to 6 percent to about 2.3 million
units by 2017, Nippon Steel said. Nippon Steel and other
Japanese steelmakers, including  JFE Holdings Inc. (5411) , are expanding
operations in  China , India and other Asian nations outside their
stagnant home market.  “We had taken a wait-and-see stance after the Lehman shock
caused a decline in demand, but we now see a steady recovery,”
said Shinichi Nakamura, general manager at the Japanese
steelmaker’s automotive flat products marketing department.  In 2010, a total of 1.64 million vehicles were produced in
Thailand, for which about 700,000 tons of galvanized steel were
used, Nakamura said.  The company has auto-steel ventures in China, India,  Brazil 
and the U.S., according to the statement.  Nippon Steel shares gained as much as 2.3 percent to 270
yen as of the 11 a.m. trading break on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
