U.S. nuclear-power output fell to
the lowest level in almost a year as reactors from  Connecticut 
to  Washington  shut in the spring refueling season, the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide decreased by 6,152 megawatts,
or 7.4 percent, from April 1 to 76,840 megawatts, or 76 percent
of capacity, the smallest amount since April 8, 2010, according
to a report today from the NRC and data compiled by Bloomberg.
Twenty-four of the nation’s 104 reactors were offline.  Energy Northwest shut its 1,190-megawatt Columbia reactor
in Washington over the weekend because the Bonneville Power
Administration warned that weather conditions may produce excess
water levels along the Columbia River hydroelectric dam system,
according to an e-mailed statement from Mark Reddemann, Chief
Executive Officer of Energy Northwest.  The plant, located 55 miles (89 kilometers) northwest of
Walla Walla, will remain closed for refueling and maintenance,
which was scheduled to begin on April 6. Work includes the $113
million replacement of a condenser that coverts steam into water
for reuse, according to the statement.  It’s the largest project in the plant’s 26 years and will
add 12 megawatts of power to its output, Brad Sawatzke, chief
nuclear officer for the company, said in the e-mail.  South  Texas  Reactor  South Texas Project Nuclear Operating Co. idled its 1,410-
megawatt South Texas 1 reactor. It was operating at full power
on April 1. South Texas 2, another 1,410-megawatt unit at the
plant, located 80 miles southwest of Houston, is operating at
100 percent of capacity.  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  closed its 1,335-megawatt Palo
Verde 2 reactor. It was operating at 90 percent of capacity on
April 1. Units 1 and 3, which have the same capacities as Unit
2, are operating at full power. The plant is located about 45
miles west of Phoenix.  Dominion Resources Inc. shut its 884-megawatt Millstone 2
reactor in Connecticut. It was operating at full power April 1.  Another reactor at the site, the 1,227-megawatt Millstone
3, is at 100 percent of capacity. The plant is located about 3
miles southwest of  New London .  The  Tennessee  Valley Authority closed its 1,123-megawatt
Watts Bar 1 reactor, 55 miles southwest of Knoxville, Tennessee.
It was operating at 82 percent of capacity on April 1.  Duke Energy shut its 846-megawatt Oconee 1 reactor in  South
Carolina . It was operating at 100 percent of capacity on April
1. Oconee 2 and 3, which also have capacities of 846 megawatts,
are running at full power. The plant is located about 30 miles
west of Greenville.  Comanche Peak  Energy Future Holdings Corp. idled the 1,150-megawatt
Comanche Peak 2 reactor in Texas. It was operating at 100
percent of capacity on April 1.  Another unit at the site, the 1,200-megawatt Comanche Peak
1, is operating at full capacity. The plant is located 66 miles
southwest of Dallas.  NextEra Energy Inc. (NEE)  slowed its 839-megawatt Saint Lucie 1
reactor in  Florida  to 80 percent of capacity from 100 percent on
April 1. Another reactor at the plant, the 839-megawatt Saint
Lucie 2, was shut. The station is located about 45 miles north
of Palm Beach.  PG&E Corp. (PCG)  boosted its 1,151-megawatt  Diablo Canyon  2
reactor in  California  to 100 percent of capacity from 35 percent
on April 1. Another reactor, the 1,149-megawatt Unit 1, is
operating at full power at the site, about 160 miles northwest
of  Los Angeles .  Georgia Reactor  Southern Co. (SO)  increased output from the 1,109-megawatt
Vogtle 1 reactor in Georgia to 80 percent of capacity from 2
percent on April 1. The unit is returning from an outage that
began March 7.  The plant is located 26 miles southeast of Augusta. Another
reactor at the site, the 1,127-megawatt Vogtle 2, is operating
at full capacity.  Dominion Resources Inc. raised power at its 556-megawatt
Kewaunee reactor in  Wisconsin  to full power from 87 percent of
capacity on April 1. The reactor is located about 27 miles
southeast of Green Bay.  FirstEnergy Corp. (FE)  slowed its 1,235-megawatt Perry nuclear
reactor in Ohio to 80 percent of capacity from 89 percent on
April 1. The plant is located on Lake Erie about 35 miles
northeast of Cleveland. FirstEnergy is based in Akron, Ohio.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the Nuclear Energy Institute.  To contact the reporter on this story:
