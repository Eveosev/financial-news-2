South Africa hasn’t been approached
about  Old Mutual Plc (OML) ’s stake in  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED) , Deputy
Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene said in response to questions
today following a report by Johannesburg-based Sunday Times that
 Standard Chartered Plc (STAN)  may buy the shareholding.  South Africa’s government will consider applications on
bank takeovers on a “case-by-case basis” and “as and when it
happens,” he told reporters in Cape Town today. The key
consideration will be the stability of South Africa’s financial
industry, Nene said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
