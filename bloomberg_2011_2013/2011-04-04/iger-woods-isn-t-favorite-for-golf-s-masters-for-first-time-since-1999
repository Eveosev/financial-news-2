Tiger Woods , who dropped to seventh
in golf’s world rankings today, isn’t the favorite to win the
Masters Tournament for the first time since 1999.  Three-time Masters champion  Phil Mickelson  is 13-2 at the
 Las Vegas Hilton’s Race and Sports Book  and at  William Hill Plc (WMH) 
to repeat as champion this week and win a fifth major golf
title. Woods, who is stuck in a 17-month winless streak, is 9-1
at both bookmakers.  Mickelson, 40, heads to Augusta National Golf Club after
winning the Houston Open yesterday with a tournament-record
score of 20-under par for his first title since last year’s
Masters. Mickelson in 2006 won the Bellsouth Classic the week
before his second Masters victory.  “It feels a lot like ’06 in that I needed to have a week
where I kind of put it together,” Mickelson told reporters at
Redstone Golf Club in Humble,  Texas . “I’ve been saying all year
I’m playing well but I’m not getting the scores out of it.”  Mickelson climbs three places to third in the  Official
World Golf Ranking , moving him ahead of Woods for the first time
since the week before Woods’s first Masters win in 1997.  Mickelson two days ago shot a 9-under-par 63 at the Houston
Open, his lowest score in two years. He followed it with a 7-
under-par final round for his 39th victory on the U.S.  PGA Tour .  “Mickelson has as good a record at Augusta as Woods and
his 63 in Houston has got people flocking into our shops,”
Rupert Adams, a spokesman for William Hill, the biggest U.K.
bookmaker with about 2,350 outlets, said in an e-mail yesterday.  Woods’s Slump  Woods, 35, is in his longest trophy drought since he turned
professional in 1996. His 71st PGA Tour win came at the BMW
Championship in September 2009 and he hasn’t won anywhere since
the Australian Masters two months later. The last of his 14
major titles came at the 2008 U.S. Open and he hasn’t won the
Masters since his fourth victory at Augusta in 2005.  Woods finished in a tie for fourth place at last year’s
Masters and  U.S. Open , equaling his best results of 2010. This
season, his only top 10 finish in four tour events was a tie for
10th at the Cadillac Championship, one of four World Golf
Championships tournaments this year. Woods played a practice
round at Augusta yesterday as Mickelson won in Texas.  Woods’s slump began after he struck a fire hydrant with his
car outside his Florida home in November 2009. He took an almost
five-month break from the sport as salacious details about his
private life emerged, leading to a divorce for repeated marital
infidelity, the loss of corporate backers including  Accenture
Plc , AT&T Inc. and  Procter & Gamble Co .’s Gillette, and the
resignation of his swing coach,  Hank Haney .  Favorite’s Tag  Woods last began the Masters without the favorite’s tag 12
years ago, when U.K. bookmaker  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  had him at 6-1 and
former world No. 1  David Duval  at 5-1. In addition to 1997 and
2005, Woods won the event in 2001 and 2002.  Lee Westwood , 37, who ended Woods’s record 281-week run as
World No. 1 on Nov. 1, is William Hill’s third favorite to win
at Augusta, at 14-1. The Englishman was second at last year’s
Masters and British Open and is chasing his first major title.
He’s a 20-1 shot at the Las Vegas Hilton, alongside  Northern
Ireland ’s Rory McIlroy.  Westwood has since been replaced as No. 1 by U.S. PGA
champion  Martin Kaymer , 26, of  Germany , who is rated an 18-1
shot by William Hill and a 20-1 chance at the Hilton, meaning a
successful $1 wager will return $20 plus the original stake.  “There’s always a bunch of guys that can win,” Mickelson
said. “I don’t think the last two days should change anything.
It’s wide open. But I certainly like the way that I play the
golf course, and I’m very pleased with the way my game is coming
round.”  At the 2006 Masters, Mickelson carried two drivers -- one
weighted to move the ball with a left-to-right flight, and the
other designed for a right-to-left flight. He said yesterday he
may do the same this year.  “With the way the weather is turning out at Augusta I
probably will,” Mickelson said.  The tournament forecast calls for sunny weather and
temperatures between 78 degrees Fahrenheit (25.5 Celsius) and
86 degrees, meaning the 7,435-yard Augusta National course may
play hard and fast. The first round is scheduled April 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
