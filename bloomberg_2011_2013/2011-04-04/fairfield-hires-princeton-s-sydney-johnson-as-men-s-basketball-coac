Fairfield University hired Sydney Johnson as men’s basketball coach, ending his four-year tenure
at  Princeton University .  Johnson, a 1997 Princeton graduate and former Ivy League
Player of the Year, had a 66-53 record with the Tigers and this
season led them to a share of the Ivy League Conference title
and a place at the National Collegiate Athletic Association
tournament.  Princeton went 25-7 this year and tied  Harvard University 
for the conference title with 12-2 records before defeating the
Crimson in a one-game playoff for the Ivy League’s automatic
NCAA tournament berth.  In its first game in the NCAA tournament since 2004,
Princeton lost by two points to the University of Kentucky --
which went on to the national semifinals.  “I am very pleased to welcome Sydney Johnson as our next
men’s basketball coach,” Fairfield Director of Athletics Gene
Doris said in a release on the school’s website. “He has been a
leader throughout his career, bringing teams to the NCAA
tournament as a player and as a coach.”  Johnson, 36, will be formally introduced as the Stags’ new
coach tomorrow at the school’s campus in Fairfield,
 Connecticut .  To contact the reporter on this story:
