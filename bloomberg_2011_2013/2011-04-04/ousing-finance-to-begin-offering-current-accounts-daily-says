Housing Finance Ltd.,  Kenya â€™s only
publicly traded mortgage company, can begin offering current
accounts under legislation signed by Finance Minister Uhuru Kenya, Nairobi-based  Business Daily  reported today.  Housing Finance has been dependent on expensive fixed-term
deposits and borrowings from other lenders, Business Daily said
citing Managing Director Frank Ireri. Current accounts will cut
the cost of collecting deposits and enable the company to lend
at lower rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
