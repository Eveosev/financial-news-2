Kazakhstan , the biggest producer of
uranium, expects to maintain output in 2013 at a minimum level
of 20,000 metric tons even as growth slows from recent years.  “We grew sharply in the last two-three years and will have
a planned slowdown in output this year, going toward a plateau
gradually,” Vladimir Shkolnik, chief executive officer of
state-run Kazatomprom, said in Almaty today. “Whether we will
sign new contracts to boost output will depend on the market.”  Kazakhstan plans to increase production of the nuclear fuel
by about 2 percent in 2012 to almost 20,000 tons, compared with
10 percent growth this year, Kazatomprom said last month. Output
will increase to 27,000 tons to 28,000 tons by 2020, it said.  Countries including  China , Germany and the U.S. reviewed
atomic energy plans after the nuclear emergency at a power plant
in Fukushima,  Japan , the world’s worst since Chernobyl, Ukraine,
in 1986. The disaster spurred speculation building of nuclear
generating capacity may slow, and with it demand for uranium.  Long-term expansion of Kazakhstan’s uranium output may be
affected by the Japan crisis, Industry and New Technologies
Deputy Minister Duisenbai Turganov said today in Astana. The
ministry has drafted a bill seeking “to regulate uranium
output,” he said in an interview, without elaborating.  “We are ready to implement any government order, whether
it will be a restriction of output or an increase,” Shkolnik
said, adding Kazatomprom doesn’t plan to sell debt.  Kazakhstan has 15 percent of the world’s uranium reserves,
the largest after the 23 percent estimated to be in  Australia ,
according to the World Nuclear Association’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
