Ireland’s exchequer  deficit  widened
by 80 percent in the first quarter, as the government injected
cash into the country’s financial system.  The deficit of 7.07 billion euros ($10.05 billion) compared
with a shortfall of 3.94 billion euros a year earlier, the
 Finance Ministry  in Dublin said in a statement today.  The increase was “primarily” due to 3.06 billion euros in
payments to Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish  Nationwide Building
Society , the Ministry said in the statement.  Ireland’s government sought an international bailout last
year, as its banking woes became too big to handle alone. The
country’s central bank said last week four banks need another 24
billion euros in capital, on top of 46 billion already pledged
to rescue the nation’s banks.  The deficit “is broadly in line with my department’s
expectations at this point in the year and means that we have
met the target set under the joint European Union/International
Monetary Fund program of financial support,” Finance Minister
 Michael Noonan  said in a statement.  Tax revenue was 136 million euros below the ministry’s
expectations, at 7.51 billion euros, as income tax and value
added taxes missed the government’s forecast. Debt servicing
costs rose 86 million euros to 848 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
