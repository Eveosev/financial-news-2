Opcon AB (OPCO) , a Stockholm-based
technology group, signed an agreement for an equity line of
credit of as much as 250 million kronor ($40 million) to invest
in clean energy and energy efficiency businesses.  Opcon signed the agreement with GEM Investment Advisors
Inc. and GEM Global Yield Fund Ltd., according to a  statement 
today from the clean energy company.  The line of credit, which runs for three years, replaces a
planned issue of a convertible loan of up to $40 million to
August Capital, according to the statement.  Opcon plans to use the money to accelerate expansion of its
renewable energy business, it said in the statement. It has
developed technology that produces electricity from waste heat.  “We have leading technology in waste heat recovery and
bio-energy, and the potential is considerable,” Mats Gabrielsson, chairman of Opcon, said in the statement.  “With the growth and development we expect to experience,
and the opportunities we have identified for energy savings
internationally, not least in countries like  China  and in the
marine sector, we need to strengthen our financial muscles.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
