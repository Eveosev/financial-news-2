Sappi Ltd. (SAP) , the world’s largest
maker of glossy paper, said it plans to raise $680 million
selling senior secured high-yield notes to refinance debt.  Sappi will use the proceeds to redeem its 6.75 percent
notes due in 2012 and repay about 200 million euros of a  term
loan , the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today.  The sale includes seven-year notes in euros that it can
redeem, or call, after four years, and 10-year dollar-
denominated bonds callable after five years, according to a
banker familiar with the transaction. The securities will be
issued through Sappi Papier Holding GmbH.  Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole CIB, JPMorgan Chase & Co.,
KBC Groep NV, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, UniCredit SpA,
Nordea Bank AB and Standard Chartered Plc are managing the sale,
said the banker, who declined to be identified because terms
aren’t set. The banks will meet investors to market the deal
today and tomorrow in  London , the banker said.  Sappi sold $500 million of the 6.75 percent bonds in 2002,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Moody’s Investors Service said it plans to rate Sappi’s new
securities Ba2.  Sappi also obtained a 350 million-euro revolving credit due
in 2016 to replace 209 million euros of a facility expiring in
2012, according to Moody’s. Sappi agreed to pay initial interest
of 5.25 percentage points more than the euro interbank offered
rate to draw the three-year  credit line  signed in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
