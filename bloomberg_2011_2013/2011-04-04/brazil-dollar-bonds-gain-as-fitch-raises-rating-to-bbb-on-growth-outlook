Brazil ’s dollar bonds rose as  Fitch
Ratings  raised the country’s rating to BBB from BBB-, citing the
economy’s growth prospects.  The extra yield investors demand to own Brazilian bonds
instead of U.S. Treasuries narrowed 1 basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 169, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “Brazil’s medium-term growth trajectory is likely to
remain relatively robust due to its domestic demand dynamics,
which are underpinned by the country’s economic diversity, a
large and growing middle class and a positive investment
cycle,” Shelly Shetty, an analyst at Fitch, said in a
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
