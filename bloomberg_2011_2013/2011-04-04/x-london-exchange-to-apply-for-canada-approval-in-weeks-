TMX Group Inc. (X)  and  London Stock
Exchange Group Plc (LSE)  will apply for Canadian regulatory approval
of their C$3.2 billion ($3.3 billion) combination “in weeks,”
said Chief Executive Officer Thomas Kloet.  “In the coming weeks, we will submit our formal merger
proposal to the various regulatory authorities in  Canada  for
consideration,” Kloet said, according to the text of a speech he
is giving today to the Toronto Board of Trade. “In that
proposal, we will outline the many benefits we believe this
merger will bring -- to Canada, to our financial sector, and to
the cities in which we operate.”  The takeover requires approval from the federal government
under the Investment Canada Act and five Canadian provincial
regulators including Ontario and  Quebec , as well as the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission. Two-thirds of TMX
shareholders must also support the deal to succeed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
