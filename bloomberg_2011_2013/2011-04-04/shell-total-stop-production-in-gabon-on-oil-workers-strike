Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Total SA
have stopped oil production in  Gabon  following a strike of oil
workers, company officials said.  “We have stopped our production to ensure the safety of
the site,” said Phenelope Semavoine, a Paris-based spokeswoman
for Total. She didn’t specify when operations were halted and
when it will resume. “Following the strike in Gabon, we decided
to shutdown the Gamba field on Friday,” Shell said in an e-
mailed statement.  Gabon’s National Organization of Oil Workers, known as
ONEP, began an indefinite strike March 31 after the government
didn’t limit the use of foreign labor in the oil industry,
according to the country’s national radio.  Total’s oil output in the West African state was 67,000
barrels of oil equivalent last year, according to the official.
Shell operates several crude fields in Gabon, including the
Rabi-Kounga field, accounting for nearly two-thirds of the
country’s production.  Crude output in Gabon totaled 240,000 barrels a day in
2010, the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly Oil
Market Report on March 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
