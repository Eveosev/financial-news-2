Most European stocks rose, extending
a three-week high for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, as chemical
makers advanced after  Solvay SA (SOLB)  agreed to buy  Rhodia SA (RHA)  for 3.4
billion euros ($4.8 billion).  Rhodia surged 48 percent in Paris trading, its biggest
increase on record.  Nokian Renkaat Oyj (NRE1V)  climbed 7.9 percent as
Nordic region’s biggest tiremaker reported increased earnings
and revenue.  Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena SpA (BMPS)  fell 1.9
percent after a report the Italian bank may raise 2 billion
euros in new capital.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.1 percent to 280.26 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London  as three stocks gained for every two that
declined. The gauge has advanced 6.9 percent from this year’s
low on March 16 amid speculation the economic recovery will
withstand  Japan ’s worst earthquake on record and popular revolts
in the Middle East and north Africa.  “The expectation of a range-bound market over the next
three to six months has become very fashionable,”  Mislav Matejka , head of European equity strategy at JPMorgan Chase &
Co., wrote in a report today. “In contrast, we believe the
market could surprise by its resiliency, we remain constructive
on equities and continue to advise buying any dips.”  National benchmark indexes rose in 10 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 rose 0.1 percent and
 Germany ’s DAX lost 0.1 percent.  France ’s CAC 40 Index fell 0.3
percent.  ECB Rates  The  European Central Bank  may raise  interest rates  this
week for the first time in almost three years as inflation
accelerated to 2.6 percent in March. A Bloomberg survey shows
that economists forecast the bank will boost its benchmark rate
by a quarter point to 1.25 percent when policy makers convene in
Frankfurt on April 7.  Rhodia soared 48 percent to 31.21 euros. Solvay agreed to
buy the specialty chemicals producer for 31.60 euros a share as
the Belgian maker of soda ash seeks to expand operations in
emerging markets. Solvay gained 2.3 percent to 85.79 euros.  A gauge of chemical companies in the Stoxx 600 climbed to
the highest level since at least 1987.  Croda International Plc (CRDA) ,
a supplier of ingredients for Nivea sunblock, gained 1.4 percent
to 1,718 pence. Leverkusen, Germany-based  Lanxess AG (LXS)  jumped 3.7
percent to 56.73 euros and France’s  Arkema SA (AKE)  gained 2.3 percent
to 66.66 euros.  Nokian Renkaat rallied 7.9 percent to 33.24 euros after the
tiremaker said earnings “clearly” increased. First-quarter

profit between 65 million and 70 million euros. The company is
due to publish results on May 6.  Rio Tinto  Rises  Rio Tinto Group climbed 1.3 percent to 4,478 pence after
analysts at Nomura Holdings Inc. said the third-largest mining
company may double a share buyback plan to $10 billion after
purchasing $800 million of stock, or 16 percent of the program
announced in February.  The management’s share purchases have “progressed faster
than expected,” Paul Cliff, a Nomura analyst, wrote in a note
today. “They believe the buyback could take half as much time
as initially scheduled,” he said after Chief Executive Officer
Tom Albanese visited the securities firm in London on April 1.  Aggreko Plc (AGK)  surged 5.3 percent to 1,678 pence after winning
a contract to provide temporary  power plants  supplying 200
megawatts of electricity in Japan following the March 11
earthquake.  Monte Paschi lost 1.9 percent to 87.5 euro cents after La
Stampa reported Italy’s third-biggest bank is considering
