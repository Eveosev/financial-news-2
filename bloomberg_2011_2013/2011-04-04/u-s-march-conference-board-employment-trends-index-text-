Following is the text of U.S. employment trends index
from the Conference Board.  The Conference Board Employment Trends Index increased again in March, for the
sixth month in a row. The index now stands at 100.9, up from February’s revised
figure of 100.3. The index is up over 8 percent from a year ago.  Says Gad Levanon, Associate Director, Macroeconomic Research at The Conference
Board: “The Employment Trends Index started signaling acceleration in employment
growth late last year, which we are now experiencing. In the last six months,
employment excluding construction and state and local government has been growing
faster than almost any other 6-month period in the past decade. We do not expect a
turnaround in those sectors, which are still lagging, nor do we forecast
acceleration in overall economic growth in the next several quarters. As a result,
employment growth is likely to continue growing at its current rate and not improve
further for the rest of 2011.”  This month’s increase in the ETI was driven by positive contributions from five
out of the eight components. Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill
Right Now was unchanged. The improving indicators included Initial Claims for
Unemployment Insurance, Number of Temporary Employees, and three forecasted
components, which are Job Openings,  Industrial Production , and Real Manufacturing
and Trade Sales.  The Employment Trends Index aggregates eight labor-market indicators, each of
which has proven accurate in its own area. Aggregating individual indicators into a
composite index filters out so-called “noise” to show underlying trends more clearly.  The eight labor-market indicators aggregated into the Employment Trends Index
include:  Percentage of Respondents Who Say They Find “Jobs Hard to Get” (The Conference
Board Consumer Confidence Survey)  Initial Claims for Unemployment Insurance (U.S. Department of Labor)  Percentage of Firms With Positions Not Able to Fill Right Now (National
Federation of Independent Business Research Foundation)  Number of Employees Hired by the Temporary-Help Industry ( U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics )  Part-Time Workers for Economic Reasons (BLS)  Job Openings (BLS)  Industrial Production (Federal Reserve Board)  Real Manufacturing and Trade Sales (U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis)  The Conference Board publishes the Employment Trends Index monthly, at 10 a.m.
ET on the Monday that follows each Friday release of the Bureau of Labor Statistics
employment situation report. The technical notes to this series are available on The
