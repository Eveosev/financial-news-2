Iraqi lawmakers named a new planning
minister and have yet to agree on top security posts, three
months after Prime Minister Nuri al-Malikiâ€™s cabinet was formed.  Lawmakers voted unanimously on appointing Ali Youssef Abdel
Nabi in  Baghdad  today, according to the website of his political
party, the Sadr Trend, which is led by Shiite Muslim cleric
Moqtada al-Sadr. State-sponsored al-Iraqiya television had
earlier identified the new minister as Ali Youssef al-Shukri.  The post had been vacant because of political disagreements
between the coalitions that formed the unity government in
November, eight months after elections. The jobs of defense,
interior and national security ministers have yet to be assigned
and are being overseen by al-Maliki.  To contact the reporter on this story:
