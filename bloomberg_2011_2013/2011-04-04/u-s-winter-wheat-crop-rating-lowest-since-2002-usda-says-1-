The U.S. winter-wheat crop had the
lowest government rating in nine years as dry weather persists
in the southern and central Great Plains.  About 37 percent of the crop was good or excellent as of
yesterday, down from 65 percent a year earlier, the  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  said today in a  report , the first this
year measuring conditions in all growing states. The reading was
the lowest for the date since 2002, when 31 percent got the top
ratings.  Parts of  Texas , Oklahoma, Kansas and Colorado had less than
25 percent of normal rainfall in the past 30 days, according to
the  National Weather Service . As of yesterday, 12 percent of the
Texas crop was in good condition with no excellent rating. In
Kansas, the biggest winter-wheat growing state, 31 percent of
the crop was rated good to excellent.  “We’re off to a substandard start” to the growing season,
said  Don Roose , the president of U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines , Iowa. “Long term, it may take grain out of the
market, when you have ratings this low.”  Parts of Kansas and Colorado faced “severe”  drought  as of
March 29, while conditions in areas of Oklahoma and Texas
reached “extreme” drought, according to data from the
University of Nebraska at Lincoln.  The USDA also said that 6 percent of the cotton crop was
planted, up from 4 percent a year earlier, and 16 percent of
rice was sown, up from 13 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
