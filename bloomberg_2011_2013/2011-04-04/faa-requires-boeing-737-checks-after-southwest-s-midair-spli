U.S. aviation regulators will
require carriers to inspect about 175 older  Boeing Co. (BA)  737s, the
world’s most widely flown jet, for fuselage cracks after a
 Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  plane split open in flight.  An emergency directive will be issued tomorrow, the  Federal
Aviation Administration  said in a statement today. There are
about 1,800 of those models in service. The FAA is only
requiring inspections on planes that have taken off and landed
more than 30,000 times.  Cracks were discovered on three Southwest 737-300s in
inspections for metal fatigue after the April 1 incident over
Arizona. The carrier canceled 70 flights today, following 600
over the weekend, as it worked to finish examining 79 of the
jets. Airlines must make regular checks of planes for metal
fatigue, which can occur as jets endure the stress of takeoffs,
landings and low outside air pressure of high-altitude flight.  “Southwest’s high utilization of its aircraft and short
average flight length means that its planes accumulate more
takeoffs and landings than do most airlines’ fleets in a given
time frame,” James M. Higgins, an analyst for New York-based
Soleil Securities, said in a report. Higgins has a “buy”
rating on Dallas-based Southwest.  Boeing is issuing its own service bulletin urging carriers
to check lap joints on some 737-300s, 737-400s and 737-500s,
said Marc Birtel, a spokesman in Seattle. Those joints are where
the aluminum fuselage skin panels overlap and are attached with
fasteners.  ‘Well-Established’ Procedures  The  National Transportation Safety Board  is probably
looking at whether checks are required often enough and whether
the repetitive inspection process “actually contributes to
accelerating the propagation of cracks,” said Bob Mann,
president of consultant R.W. Mann & Co. in Port  Washington ,  New
York .  Airlines have been carrying out “well-established”
procedures to check for fatigue since an Aloha Airlines flight
attendant was sucked out of a 737 through an 18-foot hole that
ripped open during a 1988 flight to  Hawaii , said  Hans Weber ,
president of Tecop International Inc. in  San Diego .  Inspectors crawl all over the planes with electromagnetic
instruments looking for small cracks, particularly along the lap
joints.  “The whole community worked really hard after Aloha to get
full control over this aging aircraft problem,” Weber said.
“And until about last year, we basically had no more problems.
This is not good. This is really a surprise.”  Earlier Incidents  The Southwest incident follows two emergency landings since
2009 caused by planes ripping open.  In July 2009, metal fatigue was blamed for an 18-by-12-inch
rip in a Southwest 737 that was flying at 35,000 feet. In
January 2010, the FAA ordered fuselage checks for metal fatigue
on 135 737-300s, -400s and -500s in the U.S., after Boeing
recommended such checks in September 2009.  In October 2010, a 1-by-2-foot hole opened on an American
Airlines Boeing 757 flying at 31,000 feet, leading to an
emergency landing. That and an 11-inch crack found in an
inspection the month before on a  United Continental Holdings
Inc. (UAL)  757 prompted the FAA in January to require checks on 683 of
those planes.  As of today, 67 Southwest 737-300s had been inspected and
64 returned to service, the airline said. The checks should be
completed tomorrow, according to the carrier.  Southwest is the world’s biggest operator of 737s, with 548
of the planes. According to its website, it had 171 737-300s at
the end of 2010, with an average age of 19 years. The airline
also has 25 737-500s that are an average 20 years old.  United, Lufthansa  United Continental has 34 737-500s, and all have fewer than
25,000 cycles, said  Mary Clark , a spokeswoman for the Chicago-
based carrier.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  checked three of its 33 737-300s and
didn’t find any problems, said Christian Gottschalk, a spokesman
for the carrier. The German airline is the world’s second-
biggest operator of the 737-300, after Southwest, according to
data from aviation consulting firm Ascend.  Lufthansa and its BMIbaby unit, which has another 11 of the
737-300, said before today’s announcements that they were
awaiting further instruction from Boeing.  Alaska Air Group Inc. (ALK) , which operates some 737-400s,
couldn’t immediately comment on whether its jets need the new
inspections.  Southwest fell 21 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $12.46 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Chicago-based
Boeing fell 6 cents to $73.95.  Cracking Near Hole  The NTSB said yesterday that the Southwest jet showed signs
of fatigue cracking near the hole in the hull after it was
inspected following the emergency landing in Yuma,  Arizona .
Flight 812 passengers described the hole as being 1 foot wide by
3 feet long, said Linda Rutherford, a spokeswoman.  The cracks were “no longer than a quarter of an inch,”
and difficult to see without magnification, Robert Sumwalt, an
NTSB member, said in a briefing late yesterday.  “Cracking is wear and tear on an airplane,” he said.
“From the first time an airplane flies, we see wear and tear on
it. That is the reason our fleet of airplanes has redundancy
built into it, and that’s why we have maintenance and inspection
requirements.”  The Flight 812 aircraft will be 15 years old in June; its
fuselage skin had been inspected on March 29 and Feb. 5, said
Rutherford, the airline spokeswoman. It had flown 39,781 cycles,
which each include one takeoff and one landing.  Maintenance Records  The NTSB has analyzed Southwest maintenance records and
found all inspections on the plane were up to date, there were
no discrepancies and no outstanding maintenance items, Sumwalt
said in a televised briefing today from Yuma. All FAA directives
were complied with and up to date, he said.  A portion of the plane’s fuselage is en route to Washington
for further analysis, Sumwalt said. Joe Sedor, the investigator
in charge, said the plane has been released back to Southwest,
which is working with Boeing and the FAA to return it to
service.  The April 1 incident occurred as Flight 812 was bound for
 Sacramento ,  California , from Phoenix. A flight attendant and a
passenger were injured, Rutherford said.  -- With assistance from  Dan Hart  and John Hughes in Washington,
