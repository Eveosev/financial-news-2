Corn prices climbed to a 33-month
high after a government report showed shrinking U.S.
inventories, while storms in the Midwest threatened to delay
spring planting. Soybeans declined.  Corn stockpiles on March 1 dropped to 6.523 billion
bushels, the lowest for the date in four years, as demand
increased for grain used as livestock feed, biofuel and food
products, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said on March 31.
The upper Midwest may have “frequent showers” in the next two
weeks, with as much as 1.25 inches (3.2 centimeters) of rain in
the next five days, Commodity Weather Group said.  “The perception that you have to ration old-crop stocks is
pretty well entrenched,” because of the tightening stockpiles,
said Louise Gartner, the owner of Spectrum Commodities in
Beavercreek,  Ohio . “You do have a lot of rain going across the
South into the Midwest, and that’s just going to slow
planting.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 24.25 cents, or 3.3
percent, to settle at $7.6025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade, the highest closing price ever for a
contract closest to expiration. Earlier, the grain reached
$7.65, the highest for a most-active contract since July 7,
2008.  The commodity has more than doubled in the past year. In a
report on April 8, the USDA may lower its estimate for
inventories in the year ending Aug. 31 because of increasing
demand for feed and ethanol, said  Rich Nelson , the director of
research at Allendale Inc. in McHenry,  Illinois .  Soybeans Drop  Soybean futures for May delivery fell 9.75 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $13.84 a bushel. The price has gained 47 percent in
the past year.  Wet weather in the Dakotas and  Minnesota  may limit corn
sowing, spurring farmers to increase acreage of soybeans later,
Nelson said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest exporters of both
crops.  The Red River of the North in Fargo may rise to major stage
flooding this week for the third straight year, according to the
 National Weather Service .  “If we have planting delays up north, farmers will switch
to new-crop beans,” Nelson said.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
