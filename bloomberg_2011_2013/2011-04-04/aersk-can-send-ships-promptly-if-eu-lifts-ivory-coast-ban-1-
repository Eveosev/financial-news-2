A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, the world’s
largest container-shipping line, would be able to send ships to
 Ivory Coast  “immediately” if the European Union were to lift
sanctions against the country, according to Sonny Dahl, director
of West Africa services at the company.  “We always have vessels nearby the Ivory Coast ports,”
Dahl said in an e-mailed response to questions today. “We
therefore will be able to deploy vessels into the ports of
Abidjan and  San Pedro  immediately after the EU sanctions have
been lifted.”  Some “initial” congestion may be expected as “all
shippers and consignees will be trying to get their cargo into
and out of the ports,” he said. “This will, however, likely
stabilize after some weeks.”  The EU in January announced a freeze on the assets of Ivory
Coast ports and the state oil company. The country has been
gripped by a political standoff as incumbent President  Laurent
Gbagbo  refuses to step down for Alassane Ouattara, who is
internationally recognized as the winner of an election in
November.  Maersk Line currently has no service in and out of Ivory
Coast because of the EU sanctions, according to Dahl. It takes
about 11 days to get from the African nation to the U.K., he
said. Ivory Coast is the world’s largest cocoa producer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
