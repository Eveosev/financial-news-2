Rubber rallied to the highest in
more than one week as oil reached a 30-month high, increasing
the cost of rival synthetic products and boosting demand
prospects for the commodity used to make tires.  The September-delivery contract rose as much as 4.1 percent
to 444.7 yen a kilogram ($5,284 a metric ton), the highest since
March 23, on the  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange and closed at 444.1
yen. The most-active contract lost 0.5 percent last week, the
first drop in three weeks.  “High  oil prices  have underpinned rubber prices,” said
 Hiroyuki Kikukawa , general manager of research at IDO Securities
Co. in Tokyo. A fall in the yen against the dollar also boosted
the value of the Japanese currency-based Tokyo futures, he said.  Crude oil for May delivery gained as much as 0.7 percent to
$108.74 per barrel in electronic trading on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange , the highest since price Sept. 24, 2008, and
was at $108.44. Prices are up 25 percent from a year ago.  The yen was at 84.14 per dollar from 84.06 in  New York  on
April 1. The Japanese currency declined 1.7 percent in March.  Floods in  Thailand , the world’s largest natural-rubber
producer, have disrupted output over the past week. Production
may fall 50,000 tons, Luckchai Kittipol, president of the Thai
Rubber Association, said on April 1.  Rubber for September delivery declined 0.7 percent to close
at 34,635 yuan ($5,290) a ton on April 1 on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange. Markets in China are closed today for a holiday.  Natural-rubber inventories monitored by the Shanghai
Futures Exchange fell for an eighth week, losing 5,587 tons to
27,611 tons, a six-month low, based on a survey of 10 warehouses
in Shanghai, Shandong, Yunnan, Hainan and Tianjin, the bourse
said April 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
