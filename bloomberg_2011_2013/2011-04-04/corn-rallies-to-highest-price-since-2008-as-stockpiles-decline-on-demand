Corn rose for a third day to the
highest price since 2008 in  Chicago  on concern that a planned
increase in sowing in the U.S. will fail to rebuild global
inventories drained by stronger demand.  U.S. corn stockpiles on March 1 dropped to 6.52 billion
bushels, the lowest level for that date since 2007, the
Department of Agriculture said on March 31. Farmers in the
country will expand corn sowing to 92.178 million acres this
year, the second-largest area since 1944, it said, citing a
survey. The U.S. is the world’s biggest corn exporter.  “Despite higher U.S. plantings, demand remains robust,
inventories hover at dangerously low levels and weather remains
a risk as ever,” said  Sudakshina Unnikrishnan , an analyst at
 Barclays Capital  in London.  Corn for May delivery climbed 12.5 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $7.485 a bushel at 1:14 p.m. London time on the Chicago Board
of Trade. The grain reached $7.50, the highest level for a most-
active contract since July 2008, when a global food crisis
spurred riots worldwide. Corn touched an all-time high of
$7.9925 on June 27, 2008.  “At first glance, the plantings report showed the typical
acreage response to elevated  price levels ,” Unnikrishnan said.
“The stocks report highlighted the strength of underlying
fundamentals, which have kept inventories persistently low.”  Record Food Prices  Surging corn may help to extend a rally in food costs,
which reached a record in February, according to a United
Nations gauge. Prices gained as global demand was  estimated  by
the USDA to beat output this season by 21.4 million metric tons,
cutting stockpiles to 123.1 million tons, the lowest level in
four years.  The USDA report is “still driving the markets,” Simon
Clancy, manager for export brokerage at FCStone Australia Pty
Ltd., said by phone from Sydney today, referring to shrinking
U.S. and global corn stockpiles. “It’s not something that’s
going to be resolved anytime soon.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. increased its three-month forecast
for corn by 39 percent to $8.60 a bushel after the USDA figures
last week. “Corn prices need to rise strongly in the near term
to ration demand,” the bank said in a report on April 1.  Twenty-three of 29 traders and analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg News from  Tokyo  to Chicago on April 1 said corn will
gain this week. The U.S. harvest represents about 39 percent of
global output in the 2010-2011 season, according to USDA data.  Soybeans for May delivery rose 3.75 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $13.975 a bushel. The oilseed has added 48 percent in the
past year, partly on increased Chinese demand.  Wheat for May delivery gained 13.25 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $7.7275 a bushel. The grain has increased 65 percent over the
past year. Milling wheat for May delivery traded on NYSE Liffe
in Paris climbed 3 euros, or 1.3 percent, to 242.75 euros
($345.60) a ton.  To contact the reporters on this story:
