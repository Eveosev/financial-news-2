Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ,  Canada ’s largest
pipeline operator, expects a decision by the end of next year
from Canadian regulators on a proposed C$5.5 billion ($5.7
billion) pipeline to ship bitumen to Canada’s Pacific coast.  If approved, the pipeline would “likely” be operational
sometime between 2017 and 2019, said John Carruthers, who heads
the company’s efforts to build the project, during a
presentation today in Calgary.  “It’s possible that we could get this up and running
earlier, but 2017 to 2019 is most likely,” he said.  Enbridge aims to reduce Canada’s dependency on the U.S. as
the main market for oil refined from  Alberta ’s bitumen deposits
with the 1,172-kilometer (730-mile) Northern Gateway project. An
advisory panel consisting of Canadian energy and environmental
regulators is assessing Enbridge’s application, submitted last
May, and will hold discussions with communities along the
proposed route, Carruthers said.  The Calgary-based company is offering native groups living
along the proposed route in British Columbia a 10 percent stake
in the pipeline and is helping to organize financing for them,
he said.  The project is expected to add C$270 billion to Canada’s
economy over 30 years and generate C$81 billion in  tax revenue 
for Canadian governments, Carruthers said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
