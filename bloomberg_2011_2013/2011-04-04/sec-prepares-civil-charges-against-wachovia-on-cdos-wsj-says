The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission is preparing to bring civil charges against Wachovia
Corp., a bank now owned by  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , relating to the
sale of collateralized debt obligations, the Wall Street Journal
reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  The SEC suspects Wachovia of overpricing the CDOs, which
are a financial instrument consisting of packaged mortgages, the
newspaper said.  Wells Fargo, which acquired Wachovia in 2008 for $19.36
billion, wouldnâ€™t comment, the WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
