KKR Asset Management LLC , a unit of
KKR & Co., plans to raise a closed-end fund to invest in fixed-
income securities including loans, according to a regulatory
filing.  KKR Global Credit Opportunities Fund will seek to invest at
least 80 percent of its assets in senior loans and debt
securities such as high-yield bonds and credit-default swaps,
according to a preliminary prospectus filed April 1.  KKR Asset Management  is the manager of KKR Financial
Holdings LLC, the publicly traded credit arm of KKR & Co. The
new fund follows the firm’s closing last week of a $400 million
collateralized loan obligation. The filing also comes after
borrowers in the U.S. sold the most leveraged loans last quarter
since before the credit crisis.  Speculative-grade companies have raised $149.5 billion of
loans this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Loan
prices as measured by the Standard & Poor’s/LSTA U.S. Leveraged
Loan 100 Index have risen to 95.91 cents as of April 1 from a
low of 59.2 cents in December 2008. The latest price compares
with a high this year of 96.48 cents on Feb. 14.  In January, Blackstone Group LP raised a $250 million
closed-end fund to invest in first-and second-lien loans and
high-yield bonds.  Kristi Huller, a spokeswoman for KKR, declined to comment
on the size of KKR Global Credit Opportunities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
