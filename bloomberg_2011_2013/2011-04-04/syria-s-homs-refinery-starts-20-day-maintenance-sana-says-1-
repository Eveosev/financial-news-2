Syria ’s Homs oil refinery started
20-day maintenance on its main crude unit, the official Syrian
Arab News Agency reported, citing Haitham Msoukar, head of
engineering at the plant.  The work will include the replacement of the unit’s main
60-meter (200-foot) chimney with one that will decrease
pollution and improve production, he said, according to the
report today. Maintenance at the refinery’s units for asphalt
production and crude oil distillation has ended, he said.  The state-owned Homs refinery processed 5.8 million metric
tons of crude in 2010, up 1.6 percent from 2009, the Oil
Ministry said Feb. 2. The refinery, first started in 1959, is
located in central Syria, near northern Lebanon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
