Kazatomprom ,  Kazakhstan ’s state-
owned uranium company, plans to invest about $800 million with
Russian and Japanese partners to mine rare-earth metals as
supplies from  China  shrink.  The company and its Russian counterpart Rosatom Corp. may
invest as much as $500 million to mine rare earths in Russia and
Kazakhstan, Kazatomprom Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Shkolnik said in an interview, without giving a timeframe. In
Japan, Kazatomprom has teamed up with  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  and  Sumitomo
Corp. (8053)  in ventures that may cost a total $300 million, he said.  China, which produces about 95 percent of global rare-earth
supply, has been curbing domestic output growth and exports of
the metals to conserve resources and protect the environment,
prompting users such as  Japan  to seek alternative sources. Rare
earths -- a group of 17 chemically similar metals -- are used in
hybrid cars, wind turbines, electronics and weaponry.  Kazatomprom last year set up a venture with Tokyo-based
Sumitomo to extract rare earths including molybdenum and rhenium
from uranium ore. The venture may need about $200 million in
investment, Shkolnik said today in Almaty, Kazakhstan. A $100
million tie-up with Toshiba may produce niobium, rhenium,
wolfram, tantalum and beryllium, Kazatomprom said.  Kazakhstan’s output of beryllium, used in aerospace
equipment and weapons, will rise to 2,000 metric tons in 2014
from 712 tons in 2009, the Ministry of Industry and New
Technologies said on its  website . The Central Asian nation plans
to produce 1,500 tons of the element this year, Shkolnik said.  The country’s output of tantalum, used in cell phones and
computers, will climb to 297 tons in 2014 from 137 tons in 2009,
the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
