Danish opposition lawmakers want an
investigation into whether banks have been fixing the countryâ€™s
interbank rate too high, FinansWatch reported.  Social Democrat spokesman Orla Hav says the party may call
on Economy Minister Brian Mikkelsen to explain what he plans to
do to ensure the Copenhagen Interbank Offered Rate is set at the
right level, the online news service said today. Villum
Christensen, spokesman for the opposition Liberal Alliance, also
wants an investigation into Cibor setting, he told FinansWatch.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
