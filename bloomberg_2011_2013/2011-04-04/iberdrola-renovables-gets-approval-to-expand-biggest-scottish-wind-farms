Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR)  won approval
from Scottish regulators to increase the capacity of its two
biggest wind farms in the nation, the company said in an e-
mailed press release.  The Whitelee park will be increased by 217 megawatts to 539
megawatts and the Black Law plant will be increased by 69
megawatts to 193 megawatts. The expanded plants will provide
more than twice the power required by Glasgow,  Scotland â€™s
biggest city, Iberdrola said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
