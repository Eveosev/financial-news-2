The Federal Reserve Bank of New York
began an auction of mortgage bonds acquired in the bailout of
insurer  American International Group Inc. (AIG) , according to three
people with direct knowledge of the offering.  The New York Fed is collecting bids on more than $1.4
billion of securities and expects offers on April 6 or sooner,
according to the people, who declined to be identified because
they weren’t authorized to discuss the sales process. Jack Gutt,
a spokesman for the New York Fed, declined to comment.  The Fed is selling mortgage bonds in blocks after refusing
an offer from New York-based AIG to buy the entire pool for
$15.7 billion.  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  and  Morgan
Stanley (MS)  were among investment banks trying to aggregate bids
from clients for the securities, people familiar with their
plans said last month.  The New York Fed and the Board of Governors “judged that
the public interest in maximizing returns from any sale and
promoting financial stability would be better served by an
alternate approach,” rather than by accepting AIG’s offer, the
Fed said in a  statement  last week.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the New York
Fed’s investment manager, is managing the offerings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
