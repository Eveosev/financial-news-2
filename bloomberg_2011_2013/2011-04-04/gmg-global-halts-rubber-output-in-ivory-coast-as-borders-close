GMG Global Ltd. (GGL)  of Singapore halted
operations at its rubber plantation and production plant in
 Ivory Coast  after the closure of the country’s borders by forces
loyal to President-elect Alassane Ouattara, the company said.  The company, which owns a majority stake in Tropical Rubber
Cote d’Ivoire, has been “unable to export its products,
effective from the weekend, due to closure of the port in
Abidjan,” said Chief Executive Officer Xian Ming in a statement
published on the company’s  website .  TRCI’s plantation and factory had continued operations amid
a political crisis in the country following a disputed Nov. 28
election. The company is the second-largest buyer of rubber from
small farmers in Ivory Coast,  Africa ’s top exporter of the
commodity, and operates a factory capable of processing up to
36,000 metric tons annually, according to its website.  GMG’s operations account for 12 percent of Ivory Coast’s
annual rubber exports, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
