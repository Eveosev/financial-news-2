Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. (BRK/A)  may pursue acquisitions for its MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co. unit as the billionaire chairman seeks to boost investments
in capital-intensive industries, CreditSights Inc. said.  Ameren Corp. (AEE)  and  Pinnacle West Capital Corp. (PNW)  are among the
firms that MidAmerican may consider acquiring, the debt-analysis
company said in a note late yesterday. Buffett named Gregory Abel as chairman of MidAmerican last week right as  David Sokol 
resigned the post after investing his personal funds in a
company that Berkshire bought.  “As long as the Sokol situation does not spiral out of
control, we believe MidAmerican will bid on a U.S. utility,”
CreditSights analysts Dot Matthews and Scott Greenstein said in
a report. The analysts cited the company’s annual fixed income
conference, which was held before Sokol’s departure.  Buffett, who keeps all of MidAmerican’s profits at the
unit, has been seeking to expand the energy business, which
contributed about $1.13 billion to  earnings  last year at Omaha,
Nebraska-based Berkshire. E.ON AG’s U.K. power grid drew
interest from  Des Moines , Iowa-based MidAmerican before PPL
Corp. bought the business for about 3.5 billion pounds ($5.7
billion), according to people familiar with the matter.  Buffett may seek firms where MidAmerican management can
“mend regulatory relationships” for the target company, the
analysts said. Berkshire may also consider acquisitions where
MidAmerican can “lessen the utility’s cash burden by removing a
dividend requirement” or pursue new opportunities for
transmission or generation projects, CreditSights said.  CenterPoint, NV  Alan Bunnell of Phoenix-based Pinnacle West, operator of
the largest U.S. nuclear power plant, didn’t immediately return
calls seeking comment. Susan Gallagher, a spokeswoman for St.
Louis-based Ameren, declined to comment as did MidAmerican’s Ann Thelen.  NV Energy Inc. (NVE)  and Houston-based  CenterPoint Energy Inc. (CNP) 
may also be targets, CreditSights said. CenterPoint’s Floyd LeBlanc and NV’s Mark Severts declined to comment.  An acquisition wouldn’t hurt MidAmerican’s credit quality
because of Berkshire commitment to the company, CreditSights
said. Berkshire may fund acquisitions separate from its equity
agreement with MidAmerican “if necessary to maintain either
credit metrics or ratings,” the debt-analysis company said.  MidAmerican’s 5.75 percent 10-year senior notes due in
April 2018 fell 0.1 cent to 111.8 cents on the dollar on April
1, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Buffett announced
Sokol’s departure on March 30.  Sokol’s Departure  Sokol, 54, resigned as a top manager at Berkshire after
Buffett said in a statement that he had bought about 96,000
shares in  Lubrizol Corp. (LZ)  in January, less than two weeks before
recommending the company as a target, according to a statement
from Buffett. Sokol joined Berkshire in 2000 when he sold
MidAmerican, which he had led as chief executive officer, to
Buffett for about $9 billion.  Sokol has said there was nothing
unethical about his investment.  Buffett said Berkshire needs acquisitions to build
Berkshire, which generates about $1 billion in profit a month.
MidAmerican is positioned to increase investments because the
unit “retains all of its earnings, unlike other utilities that
generally pay out most of what they earn,” Buffett said in
February in his  annual letter .  MidAmerican, which struck a deal in 2008 to buy
Constellation Energy Group Inc., walked away with $593 million
that year, including a $175 million termination fee, after
Electricite de France SA bought half of Constellation’s nuclear
power business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
