The amount of oil products stored in
tankers at sea rose 22 percent in March,  Lloyd’s List  reported,
citing data from E.A. Gibson Shipbrokers Ltd.  Thirty seven tankers held 3.7 million metric tons of oil
products last month, up from 29 vessels in February, it reported
today. The article didn’t give a precise figure for how much was
being stored in cargo terms in February.  The additional storage happened mostly in northwestern
 Europe , it said.  The amount of crude oil stored stayed the same at 5.5
million tons, Lloyd’s List said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
