Hungary  is seeking to cut the
administrative burden of companies by 500 billion forint ($2.7
billion) by the end of the year, said Zoltan Csefalvay, a state
secretary in the  Economy Ministry .  The cuts, to be implemented in two steps this year with a
100 billion-forint package to be announced “soon” and the rest
before the end of 2011, won’t hurt budget revenue, Csefalvay
told reporters in Budapest today. He declined to specify
measures before the Cabinet approves them.  “It’s a win-win situation,” Csefalvay said, adding that
the savings may allow companies to boost investments and help
accelerate economic growth.  Companies in Hungary spend a total of 2.8 trillion forint
on administrative costs, or more than 10 percent of the
country’s gross domestic product, Csefalvay said. Of this,
companies deem 800 billion forint “not as an administrative
cost but as an administrative burden” which could be
eliminated, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
