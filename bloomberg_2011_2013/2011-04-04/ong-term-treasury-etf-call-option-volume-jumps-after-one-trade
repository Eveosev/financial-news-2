Trading of bullish options on an
exchange-traded fund tracking long-term Treasuries jumped to the
highest level since September after a single block trade that
profits if bond prices increase, driving yields lower.  The block of 45,000 June $101 calls to buy the iShares
Barclays 20+ Year Treasury Bond Fund traded at the ask price and
exceeded the prior open interest of 764 contracts, indicating a
buyer who expects the ETF to rally initiated the transaction.
Total call trading volume for the fund, which rose 0.1 percent
to $92.29 at 4 p.m.  New York  time, was 65,687 contracts, or
quadruple the four-week average.  The call buyer may be betting that Treasuries will end a
decline that began in August, when Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  suggested he was ready to take action to prop up the
economy, said Kevin Nichols of Newedge Group. The central bank’s
subsequent $600 billion program of buying Treasuries, known as
quantitative easing, ends in June.  “This particular trade is looking at the end of
quantitative easing and how the yield curve is going to react,”
said Nichols, vice president for ETF strategy at Newedge in New
York. “What people expect is that with QE ending in June that
the dollar is going to rise, the U.S. stock market will weaken
and the yield curve should flatten.”  Bank of America Corp. indexes show 30-year Treasuries have
lost 13 percent since Aug. 26, the day before Bernanke spoke in
 Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , while yields on the securities have
increased to 4.48 percent from 3.51 percent.  The June $101 calls on the iShares Barclays 20+ Year
Treasury Bond Fund give the right to buy 4.5 million shares of
the ETF. The fund hasn’t closed above $101 since October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
