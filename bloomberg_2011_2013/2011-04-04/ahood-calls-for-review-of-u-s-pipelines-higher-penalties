U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood told oil and gas pipeline owners and operators to review
their properties for at-risk areas as part of a campaign to
accelerate repairs and help prevent accidents.  LaHood asked Congress to boost the maximum federal civil
penalties per day for pipeline violations to $250,000 from
$100,000 and as much as $2.5 million for a series of violations
from $1 million, according to a  statement  today from the U.S.
Transportation Department.  Pipeline fatalities in Allentown,  Pennsylvania , in February
and in San Bruno,  California , in September prompted LaHood to
hold a Pipeline Safety Forum in  Washington  on April 18 for
government, industry and other pipeline safety officials.  “People deserve to know that they can turn on the lights,
the heat, or the stove without endangering their families and
neighbors,” LaHood said in today’s statement. The secretary
said he’s “taking on this critical issue to avoid future
tragedies we have seen in Allentown and around the country.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
