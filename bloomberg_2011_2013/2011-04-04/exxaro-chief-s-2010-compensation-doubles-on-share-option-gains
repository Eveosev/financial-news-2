Exxaro Resources Ltd. (EXX)  paid Chief
Executive Officer Sipho Nkosi 13.4 million rand ($2 million)
last year, almost twice as much as a year earlier, after he
registered gains on a share-options program.  Total compensation included 5.2 million rand in salary, a
3.2 million-rand performance bonus and a 4.46 million-rand gain
on share options, the Pretoria, South Africa-based coal company
said in its  annual report  distributed today. Nkosi got 6.93
million rand in 2009, when no share-option gains were recorded.  Exxaro climbed 30 percent to 136.24 rand in Johannesburg
trading last year. Net income rose fivefold to 5.21 billion rand
after commodities rallied and a write-off wasn’t repeated.  The company is  South Africa ’s second-largest coal miner,
with annual capacity of 45 million metric tons, according to its
 website .  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  produced 58.5 million tons of
thermal coal in the country last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
