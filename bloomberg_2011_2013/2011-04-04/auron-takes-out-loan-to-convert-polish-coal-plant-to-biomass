Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE) , Polandâ€™s
second-largest utility, will borrow 30 million zloty ($11
million) to help convert a coal-fired power plant in the south
to burn biomass crops for electricity and heat generation.  Conversion of the power plant in Tychy will cost about 120
million zloty in total, Magdalena Rusinek, a spokeswoman from
Katowice-based Tauron, said today by e-mail. The loan was from
the Regional Fund for Environmental Protection and Water
Management in Katowice, she said.  Tauron plans to convert the facility to burn 20 percent
straw and rapeseed crops and 80 percent forest biomass, Rusinek
said. It will have a 40-megawatt electrical capacity and 70-
megawatt heat capacity, she said.  The power plant is already owned by Tauron and the
conversion works should be done by the end of next year, Rusinek
said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
