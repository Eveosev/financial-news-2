African revenue agencies agreed to
collaborate in tax avoidance investigations and harmonize their
policies to make it harder for companies to exploit the
variation in legislation to lower their tax burden.  “The journey towards harmonization of  tax policy ” and
rates has begun, Oupa Magashula, commissioner of the South
African Revenue Service, told reporters at a meeting of the
African Tax Administration Forum in  Cape Town  today. “The main
thing is to avoid jurisdiction hopping, where people go shopping
around for the lowest tax.”  An inability to collect taxes has hampered efforts to
develop the world’s poorest continent. Sub-Saharan Africa’s tax-
to-gross domestic product ratio is about 15 percent, less than
half European Union’s, according to Logan Wort, executive
secretary of the forum, which has 31 member nations.  While Africa’s tax authorities should cooperate more
closely, a continent-wide tax regime is not feasible because of
the wide disparities between the various economies, Nhanhla
Nene,  South Africa ’s deputy finance minister, told reporters.  Tax revenue “has a key role to play in creating the fiscal
space to absorb external economic shocks and, where combined
with economic growth, is the antidote to a long-term reliance on
aid for  developing countries ,” he told delegates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
