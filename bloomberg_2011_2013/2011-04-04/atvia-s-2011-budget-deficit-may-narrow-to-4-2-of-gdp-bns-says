Latvia’s budget deficit may narrow
to 4.2 percent of gross domestic product this year if parliament
passes tax increases, the  Baltic News Service  reported, citing
Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis.  The government agreed today to measures that will raise
revenue by 102 million lati ($204 million) and increase spending
by about 20 million lati in a supplemental budget, the Riga-
based news service reported. The government’s measures to reduce
the size of the illegal and untaxed economy could shrink the
deficit to 3.8 percent of GDP this year, the news service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
