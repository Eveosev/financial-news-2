Mandi Schwartz, the former Yale
University women’s ice hockey player whose fight with leukemia
prompted the school to launch national bone marrow drives, died
from the disease. She was 23.  Schwartz, an economics major from Wilcox, Saskatchewan,
passed away yesterday surrounded by family and friends, the
school said in a  statement  on its website.  “The grace and courage with which Mandi approached her
treatment, and the enthusiasm and optimism with which Mandi
approached life itself have inspired countless people, both here
in  New Haven  and beyond,” the school said. “Her efforts -- and
the efforts of those close to her -- to raise awareness of, and
participation in, marrow and cord blood donor programs have
already yielded potentially lifesaving results.”  Schwartz was diagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia in
December 2008. The cancer starts inside the bone marrow and
grows from cells that were supposed to become white blood cells.  She underwent a stem-cell transplant using umbilical cord
blood in September 2010 after doctors were unable to find a
suitable bone marrow donor. In January, Yale officials said that
Schwartz’s cancer returned.  Yale said it will continue to conduct annual bone marrow
drives in Schwartz’s memory, with this year’s held April 21 at
the school’s campus in New Haven,  Connecticut .  Yale’s marrow donor programs helped register 4,200 people
in the U.S. and  Canada , the school said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
