The U.S. Southeast and  Gulf Coast 
have a high probability of warmer weather than usual next week,
according to the  U.S. Climate Prediction Center .  Today’s 6- to 10-day outlook says heat is probable from
South Carolina to Texas, while colder-than-normal weather may
take hold in the Pacific Northwest and Maine.  Severe drought is expected to continue through Texas,
Oklahoma and parts of Florida, according to the center, in Camp
Springs, Maryland. Conditions in western Texas and eastern  New
Mexico  may become ripe for wildfires.  The center also said there’s a possibility of above-average
rain in the Pacific Northwest, Great Lakes and U.S. Northeast
from April 10 to April 14.  In the 8- to 14-day outlook, the South and southern Great
Plains have a high chance for warmer-than-normal weather, while
the Pacific Northwest may be cooler, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
