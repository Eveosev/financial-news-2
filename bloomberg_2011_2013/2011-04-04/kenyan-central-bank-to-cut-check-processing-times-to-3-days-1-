Kenyan banks will on June 1 begin
converting checks to electronic format for clearing, reducing
the processing time to three days from as long as 10 days under
the current manual system, the central bank said.  The new system uses technology that may also help curb
fraud by automating inspections for counterfeit checks, Central
Bank of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u told reporters today in
the capital, Nairobi. It may eventually cut the time it takes to
clear a check to one day, Ndung’u said.  The new system will cost 650 million shillings ($7.8
million) to put in place, Richard Etemesi, chairman of the
Kenyan Bankers Association, said today. Etemesi is also chief
executive officer of Standard Chartered Bank Kenya Ltd., the
country’s third-largest lender by market value, after  Equity
Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  and  Barclays Bank of Kenya Ltd. (BCBL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
