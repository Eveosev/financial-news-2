The  Istanbul Gold Exchange 
introduced buying and selling of diamonds and other precious
stones today in an effort to make the city a center for the gem
trade.  The gem market will operate within the bourse, the exchange
said in a  letter  to members posted on its website. It aims to
win tax relief for the new market and create jobs in the
diamond-jewelry industry by boosting the national supply of the
precious stones, according to the letter.  The diamond market has the potential to generate $3 billion
of trading on the exchange, Aksam newspaper reported March 31,
citing an interview with Osman Sarac, the exchangeâ€™s deputy
chief.  To contact the reporters on this story:
