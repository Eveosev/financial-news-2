(Corrects to say WIPO published, not granted, Novo’s patent
application in first two paragraphs of story published April 4.)  Novo Nordisk A/S, the world’s
biggest maker of insulin for diabetics, has sought patent
protection for a synthetic version of an intestinal hormone as
part of an effort to develop medicines for treating obesity.  Novo Nordisk filed a patent application for analogues of the
hormone PYY with the  World Intellectual Property Organization ,
which published the application last month, the U.S. Federal
News Service reported on March 30. Companies can seek protection
by filing applications with Geneva-based WIPO, which administers
a global patent filing system. Individual countries still must
grant patents.  “There is a serious unmet need for adjunct therapy,
something to aid those who have a serious obesity problem with
handling their condition, together with a good lifestyle and
behavior modification,” Chief Science Officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in a phone interview. “We believe we have a role
to play.”  Novo Nordisk is using experience in creating synthetic
hormones, gained from work on insulin, to expand its lineup of
medicines. The Bagsvaerd, Denmark-based drugmaker has several
hemophilia treatments in development and aims to produce new
obesity drugs based on hormones that the body produces normally
to regulate appetite, Thomsen said by phone on April 1. Novo is
already testing a synthetic version of the gut hormone GLP-1.  “We tend to believe we should play around with Mother
Nature’s own appetite modulators,” he said.  Approvals Questions  No drug manufacturer has introduced an obesity medicine in
the U.S. in more than a decade after treatments repeatedly
faltered in trials because of potential ties to higher  blood
pressure , heart damage and  birth defects . The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has asked for more studies before approving
experimental weight- loss treatments by Vivus Inc., Orexigen
Therapeutics Inc. and Arena Pharmaceuticals Inc.  Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc. (AMLN)  and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co.
suspended joint mid-stage testing of a combination of two
synthetic hormones last month after some patients in an earlier
test developed antibodies which may neutralize the medicine’s
effect and even lead to increased eating.  Obesity drugs can be “a graveyard” for manufacturers,
Thomsen said. Still, Novo has confidence in its use of gut
hormones which, unlike older medications, don’t speed up the
body’s metabolism, affecting the heart and driving up blood
pressure, he said.  Hormone’s Effects  PYY helps signal the brain when to stop eating. People who
are obese have low levels of the hormone, and “targeting the
PYY system may offer a therapeutic strategy to help treat
obesity,” Efthimia Karra, a researcher at  University College
London ’s Centre for Diabetes and Endocrinology, said in the
January 2009 edition of The Journal of Physiology  medical
publication .  Pfizer Inc.  conducted an early stage clinical trial of a
PYY-based drug in 2006. The same year, Merck & Co. terminated an
agreement with Nastech Pharmaceutical Inc. for the development
of a nasal-spray version after early studies showed it wasn’t
effective.  Novo is experimenting with manufactured PYY versions that
patients would inject, much like liraglutide, the company’s
synthetic GLP-1 drug for diabetics that it markets as Victoza.
Thomsen declined to specify how many projects Novo is working
on, saying they’re at very early stages. The company will target
severely obese patients, especially those who also have other
conditions such as pre-diabetes, he said.  Revenue from Victoza jumped 26-fold last year to 2.32
billion kroner ($443 million), making it Novo’s fastest-growing
product. The drug won FDA approval as a diabetes treatment in
January 2010, contingent upon further post-approval studies into
potential cancer risks after earlier test results led to a delay
in regulatory clearance.  Novo plans to begin the last phase of testing liraglutide
as an obesity treatment this year. Victoza could produce
additional annual sales of as much as $5 billion should it win
the approval as an obesity drug, Mark Dainty, an analyst at
Citigroup Global Markets Inc., said in a December report to
investors.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
