Etalon Group Ltd., a developer that
builds high-rise apartment blocks in Moscow and  St. Petersburg ,
plans to raise as much $650 million in an initial public
offering and will use most of the proceeds to buy land.  Etalon set a price range of $7 to $9 per global depositary
receipt, valuing the company at as much as $2.51 billion,
according to a statement today. The developer will sell an
undisclosed number of new and existing GDRs, which will trade on
the London Stock Exchange.  Most of Etalon’s projects are residential complexes sold to
middle-income earners, including NSA Emerald Hills in Moscow and
the NSA Jubilee Estate in St. Petersburg. The company wants to
purchase land or work with owners who have been unable to
develop sites because of borrowing restrictions or financial
distress.  Etalon aims to raise $500 million by selling new shares,
while existing shareholders including Chairman Viacheslav
Zarenkov may sell another $150 million of stock.  Credit Suisse
Group AG (CSGN) , Renaissance Capital Ltd. and VTB Capital Plc are
managing the offering.  About 28 percent of Etalon’s shares will be freely traded
after the share sale, assuming the shares are sold in the middle
of the price range and no additional GDRs are offered in an
over-allotment option.  To contact the reporter on this story:
