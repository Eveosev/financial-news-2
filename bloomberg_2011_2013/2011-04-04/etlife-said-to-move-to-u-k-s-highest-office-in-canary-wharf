Metlife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, will move into the top floor of the U.K.’s tallest
office block in the  Canary Wharf  district of  London , according
to two people familiar with the plan.  New York-based Metlife will sign a lease for the fiftieth
floor of One Canada Square, a 235-meter (771-foot) building,
said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plan
hasn’t been made public.  The company is moving from the space it occupies on part of
the tower’s two lower floors and about 250 employees will work
on the top level starting at the end July, said the people.  Average prime rents in Canary Wharf were 32 percent lower
than the City of London financial district in the last quarter
of 2010, the widest gap in 13 years, CB Richard Ellis estimates.
The district attracts companies because the buildings are modern
and have large floor areas, George Iacobescu, Canary Wharf Group
Plc’s chief executive officer, said in an interview in February.
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said it will move to Canary Wharf from the
City of London after buying the former offices of Lehman
Brothers Holdings Inc. in December.  Claire Oldstein, a spokeswoman for Metlife in London,
declined to comment. Hamish McDougall, a spokesman for Canary
Wharf Group, which owns the building, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
