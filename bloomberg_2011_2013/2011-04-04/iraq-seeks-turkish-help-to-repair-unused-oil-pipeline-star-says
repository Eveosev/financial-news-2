Iraq  asked  Turkey ’s state-run
pipeline company Boru Hatlari ile Petrol Tasima AS, or Botas, to
help repair the Iraqi section of the unused 40-inch pipeline
from Kirkuk to Turkey’s Ceyhan port, the  Star  reported, citing
Botas chairman Fazil SeneL.  Iraq also wants to build a pipeline from Basra in southern
Iraq to Zakho, near the Turkish border, and then to Ceyhan to
sell Basra oil through Turkey, Senel said, according to the
Istanbul-based newspaper.  Iraq exports about 600,000 barrels a day of crude through
the larger of the twin 965-kilometer (600-mile) Kirkuk-Ceyhan
pipeline. Only the 46-inch pipeline is used for Iraq’s exports.
The 40-inch pipeline has been shut since U.N. oil sanctions on
Iraq after its invasion of  Kuwait  in 1990.  Turkey may consume 40 billion cubic meters of natural gas
this year after 39.5 billion in 2010 and may also buy the excess
natural gas that Iraq normally flares, Senel said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
