Freeworld Coatings Ltd. (FWD)  investors
may sue its directors if a takeover by Kansai Paint Co. fails,
Business Report said, citing shareholders.  Freeworld’s directors should not appeal a decision by  South
Africa ’s antitrust authorities should the Competition Commission
recommend the bid go ahead, the Johannesburg-based newspaper
cited Element Investment Management, which owns 17 percent of
Freeworld, as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
