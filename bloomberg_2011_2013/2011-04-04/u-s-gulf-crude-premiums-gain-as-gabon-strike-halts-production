Premiums for sweet crude in the U.S.
Gulf Coast strengthened against West  Texas  Intermediate after
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and  Total SA (FP)  halted production at  oil
fields  in Gabon because of a workers’ strike.  Gabon’s National Organization of Oil Workers began an
indefinite strike March 31 to protest the government’s use of
foreign labor in the oil industry, according to the country’s
national radio. Crude output in Gabon totaled 240,000 barrels a
day in 2010, the  International Energy Agency  said in its monthly
Oil Market Report on March 15.  “Gabon’s outage places added pressure on the heavy sweet
crude market, which is already tight due to Japanese demand for
direct burning in power generation,”  Lawrence Eagles , a
 JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  analyst based in  New York , wrote in a
research note today.  Gulf Coast  sweet crudes compete with imports from Nigeria
and other West African countries. Gulf differentials
strengthened as Bonny Light’s premium over Brent held steady at
$3.92 a barrel, the widest since July 2008.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened $1.50 to
$14.50 a barrel at 11:53 a.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet gained $1.40 to
$14.90 over the benchmark.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened 50 cents to $7
over WTI. Thunder Horse gained 90 cents to $11.90, Mars Blend’s
premium widened $1.05 to $7.90, and Poseidon’s premium gained $1
to $8.15 a barrel.  West Texas Sour  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $3.35 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing.  Canadian Syncrude’s premium narrowed 45 cents to $12.30 a
barrel. The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 65 cents
to $15.10 a barrel.  The grades moved after  Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  said March 31 that
it completed repairs on a hydrocracker fractionation unit
associated with its Lloydminster oil-sands upgrader in
Saskatchewan. The company operated the upgrader at 40 percent to
50 percent of capacity after a Feb. 2 fire at the fractionator,
according to  Graham White , a company spokesman based in Calgary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
