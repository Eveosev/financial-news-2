Kuwait may choose a consultant in a
month to study a rail project in the Persian Gulf nation that
may cost as much as $25 billion, a government official said.  "A consultant to conduct all feasibility studies for the
metro project prior to issuing a tender is currently being
selected," Hashem Altabtabaei, an official at the  finance
ministry  and technical team leader at the Partnerships Technical
Bureau, said in  Kuwait City  today. The bureau oversees the
government’s public-private partnership program.  "The rough value for the project, including financing and
risks, will be between 3 billion to 7 billion dinars," he said.  Kuwait’s parliament in February last year approved a 30.8
billion-dinar ($111 billion), four-year development plan
including investments to increase oil and gas production and to
build a rail network. Kuwait is the fifth-biggest producer in
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and pumped 2.4
million barrels of oil a day in March, according to Bloomberg
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
