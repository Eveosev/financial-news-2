European Union carbon permits rose
to their highest price in almost three weeks after  Der Spiegel 
 reported  tests on the blocâ€™s 143 nuclear power plants could lead
to closures, boosting reliance on fossil fuels.  Some nuclear facilities will probably not pass the safety
tests, forcing them to be upgraded or taken off line, the
magazine reported yesterday, citing an interview with the EU
Energy Commissioner Guenther Oettinger. The EU may examine low-
nuclear energy scenarios to curb emissions, Reuters reported
yesterday, citing the lead EU climate negotiator Artur Runge- Metzger.  December carbon futures gained as much as 1.3 percent to
17.45 euros ($24.82) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London, the highest price since March 16, and were
at 17.45 euros a ton as of 9:51 a.m. They rose 21 percent in the
first quarter, the biggest gain since the three months ended
June 30, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
