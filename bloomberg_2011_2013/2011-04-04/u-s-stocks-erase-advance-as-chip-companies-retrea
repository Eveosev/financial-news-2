U.S. stocks erased gains, paring the
second straight weekly rally for the Standard & Poorâ€™s 500
Index, as technology companies dropped following a decline in
semiconductor sales.  The  S&P 500  was unchanged at 1,332.41 at 10:08 a.m. in New
York after about $20 billion in global takeovers drove the index
up by 0.3 percent.  Technology companies in the S&P 500 slipped 0.5 percent,
the most among 10 industries, after the Semiconductor Industry
Association said chip sales declined 1.1 percent in February.
Intel Corp. dropped 1.4 percent, the most in the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
