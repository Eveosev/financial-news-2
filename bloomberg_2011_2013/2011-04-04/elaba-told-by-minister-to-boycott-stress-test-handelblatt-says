Dieter Posch, the economy minister
in the German regional state of Hesse, has suggested that the
state-owned Landesbank Hessen-Thueringen should boycott a  stress
test  that it might fail,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing documents
it obtained.  According to the documents, Posch said Helaba has the
option of not participating “so long as the legal framework
hasn’t been clarified,” the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
