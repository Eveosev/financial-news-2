New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  is
seeking about $517 million in U.S. funds for eight projects that
would advance high-speed-rail in the state, according to a
statement from his office.  Cuomo and other U.S. governors are angling for federal rail
funds returned by Florida Governor  Rick Scott , who rejected $2.4
billion for an 84-mile (135-kilometer) passenger line connecting
Tampa and Orlando. Scott said he didn’t want his state’s
taxpayers to face potential extra costs for the project.  “New York is embracing high-speed rail as a faster way to
move people and products and drive our economy in the 21st
century, and these federal resources would help us achieve these
goals,” Cuomo said in the statement.  The projects include $294.7 million for a two-mile route
for  Amtrak  trains that avoids conflict with Long Island Rail
Road traffic, the statement said. A congestion bypass would help
Amtrak’s Boston-to-Washington trains avoid delays along the
Northeast Corridor tracks and permit high-speed passage.  Cuomo is also asking for $49.8 million for the final design
of phase two of the Moynihan Station Project. The decades-long
plan would turn a landmark Manhattan post office near Madison
Square Garden into a railway depot, augmenting Pennsylvania
Station and adding stores and offices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
