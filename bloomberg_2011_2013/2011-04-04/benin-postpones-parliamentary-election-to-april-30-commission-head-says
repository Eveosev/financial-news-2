Benin delayed a parliamentary
election to April 30 to give candidates more time to pay fees
and allow the electoral commission to solve logistical problems,
Joseph Gnonlonfoun, the agencyâ€™s head, told reporters in Cotonou
today.  The vote was originally supposed to take place on April 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
