OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  and OAO Silvinit gained
Russian antitrust approval to create the world’s largest potash
producer, controlling as much as 45 percent of global trade in
the fertilizer through a proposed $7.8 billion merger.  Uralkali fulfilled the conditions set by the Anti-Monopoly
Service, including setting “consistent” prices for different
groups within  Russia , it said in a statement today.  Uralkali agreed to buy Silvinit in a cash and share offer
in December and expects to complete the transaction by the end
of the second quarter. The two produced a combined 10.3 million
metric tons last year, according to their financial results.
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. produced 8.6 million tons in
the same period, while  Mosaic Co. (MOS) ’s output was 7.2 million tons
in the year ended November, the latest period available.  To contact the reporters on this story:
