The  Federal Reserve ’s two rounds of
asset purchases aren’t to blame for rising commodity prices,
which are more likely linked to emerging-market demand, said
researchers at the Fed’s regional bank in  San Francisco .  “Daily data indicate that Federal Reserve announcements of
large-scale asset purchases tended to lower commodity prices,
even as long-term interest rates and the value of the dollar
declined,” researchers Reuven Glick and Sylvain Leduc said in a
paper released by the bank today.  The conclusions contrast with the views of Kansas City Fed
President  Thomas Hoenig , who said last week that the central
bank’s “highly accommodative” policy is partly to blame for
escalating global commodity prices. Crude oil futures in  New
York  have jumped more than 30 percent in the past six months
after turmoil in the Middle East threatened to disrupt supplies.  “Our analysis does not provide evidence that Federal
Reserve large-scale asset purchases fueled the rise in commodity
prices,” the economists said. “Other factors, such as growth
in emerging market economies, are more likely to be the main
drivers behind the recent rise.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
