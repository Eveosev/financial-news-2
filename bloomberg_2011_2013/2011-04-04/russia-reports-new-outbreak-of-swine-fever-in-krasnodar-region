Russia registered a new outbreak of
African swine fever in the southern Krasnodar region, food-
safety watchdog  Rosselkhoznadzor  said.  The virus was found in the bodies of dead and slaughtered
pigs at a private farm with 275 animals, Rosselkhoznadzor said
in an e-mailed statement today. Commercial farms and private
households in the regionâ€™s Labinsky district have 19,000 pigs,
it said. Another outbreak was registered in February some 25
kilometers (16 miles) away, it said.  The Agriculture Ministry said April 1 it plans to restrict
trade in animals, birds, meat and poultry, shipments of pigs,
and postal shipments of food in the Southern and North Caucasus
federal districts to prevent swine fever from spreading. The
ministry also said it would slaughter wild animals and hogs in
the districts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
