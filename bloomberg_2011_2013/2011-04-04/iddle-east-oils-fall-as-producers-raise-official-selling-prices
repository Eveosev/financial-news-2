Middle East crude oils fell as
producers raised their official prices, increasing concern that
demand may decline.  Qatar Land for June loading dropped 7 cents to a premium of
1 cent a barrel to its official selling price for May loading,
Bloomberg data showed. Murban, produced by Abu Dhabi National
Oil Co., fell 9 cents to a premium of 11 cents a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Abu Dhabi National Oil raised the official selling prices
of its crude oil exports in March, the company said in an e-
mailed statement today. Murban crude, the emirate’s largest
export grade, was increased 8.6 percent to $112.55 a barrel, the
company, known as Adnoc, said. That’s the highest since the
August 2008 price of $117.50. Lower Zakum crude rose to the same
level and Umm Shaif oil climbed to $112.05 a barrel. Upper Zakum
increased 8.4 percent to $108.90 a barrel.  The majority of Adnoc’s oil yields a large amount of
gasoil, or  diesel fuel , after basic processing. Gasoil’s premium
to Dubai crude, a measure of refining profit, jumped to $23.39 a
barrel today.  Traders judge the value of Murban against the price of
Dubai published by oil pricing service Platts. That has climbed
to $108.71 a barrel, putting Murban at a premium of $3.84 over
the benchmark grade.  Oman oil for immediate loading increased $1.49, or 1.3
percent, to $112.62 a barrel today, according to Bloomberg data.
Dubai for loading in June was up 1.3 percent at $112.19 and
Murban crude climbed 1.2 percent to $115.66.  Oman futures for June delivery rose 56 cents to $113.06 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 7:10 p.m. Singapore
time, with 791 contracts traded. The settlement price was set at
$112.99 a barrel at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for May widened 25 cents
to $7.28 a barrel, according to data from PVM Oil Associates
Ltd., a brokerage. The exchange for swaps for June increased 22
cents to $7.04.  To contact the reporter on this story:
