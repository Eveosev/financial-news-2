Britain’s effort to encourage
nuclear and renewable energy sources will “come at a cost” to
consumers that the government must discuss with voters, the
minister in charge of climate change said.  “There’s no point in trying to pull the wool over people’s
eyes and tell them these things come for free,” U.K. Climate
Change Minister Greg Barker said at the Bloomberg New Energy
Finance conference in  New York  today. “They come at a cost.”
And ministers should “treat consumers as grownups.”  “If you want to change the trajectory we’re on there is an
unavoidable but short period of change,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
