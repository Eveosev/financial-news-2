Fluor Corp. (FLR) , an Irving, Texas-based
engineering and construction company, was chosen by  SunPower
Corp. (SPWRA)  to build a solar plant in Arizona, the company said today
in a website  statement .  San Jose, California-based solar module maker SunPower won
a contract to design and build the 20-megawatt Copper Crossing
project for a unit of Spainâ€™s  Iberdrola SA (IBE)  in December.  The electricity will be used by  Salt River Project , which
supplies power to customers in the Phoenix area, SunPower said.
Salt River Project is the third-largest municipal utility in the
U.S. The plant began construction in December and will be
commissioned in 2011, Fluor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
