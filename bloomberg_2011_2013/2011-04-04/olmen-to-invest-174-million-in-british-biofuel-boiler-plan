Holmen AB (HOLMB) , the Swedish company that
sells newsprint to the Financial Times, is steering 1.1 billion
kronor ($174 million) into a biofuel boiler at its paperboard
mill in northwestern  England .  The Workington facility will have a 150-megawatt capacity
and is expected to produce 325 gigawatt-hours of electricity and
420 gigawatt-hours of thermal energy a year, according to a
 statement  today from Stockholm-based Holmen.  The power plant will meet all the mill’s energy needs,
according to Holmen’s website, and should start working in April
2013.  “The biofuel boiler will substantially reduce energy
costs, boosting the mill’s competitiveness,” Magnus Hall, chief
executive officer of Holmen, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
