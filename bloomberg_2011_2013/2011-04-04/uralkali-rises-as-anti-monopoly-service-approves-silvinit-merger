OAO  Uralkali (URKA)  climbed to its highest
level since August 2008 after gaining Russian antitrust approval
to create the world’s largest potash producer with OAO Silvinit.  Uralkali’s shares rose 0.3 percent to 241.01 rubles by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow. The company fulfilled the conditions
set by the Anti-Monopoly Service, including setting
“consistent” prices for different groups within  Russia , it
said in a statement today.  Uralkali agreed to buy Silvinit in a cash and share offer
in December and expects to complete the transaction by the end
of the second quarter. The two produced a combined 10.3 million
metric tons last year, according to their financial results.
Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. produced 8.6 million tons in
the same period, while Mosaic Co.’s output was 7.2 million tons
in the year ended November, the latest period available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
