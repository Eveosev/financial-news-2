Brazil ’s central bank will take the
necessary steps to ensure that inflation slows to its target
over the course of 2012, a government official familiar with
monetary policy strategy said.  Policy makers in Latin America’s biggest economy will also
attempt to bring 2011 inflation as close as possible to the 4.5
percent target, said the official, who asked not to be named
because he isn’t authorized to discuss the issues publicly.  “This demonstration that they are committed to bringing
inflation back to target by all means allays a bit the feeling
that the central bank won’t raise rates again this year,” said
 Jankiel Santos , chief economist at Espirito Santo Investment
Bank in  Sao Paulo . “It reinforces the idea the central bank
will increase rates in April.”  Traders are wagering policy makers will slow the pace of
interest rate increases this month, after the central bank said
in its March 30 inflation report that the costs of meeting the
consumer price target this year were “too high.”  The yield on interest rate futures contract maturing
January 2012, the most traded in Sao Paulo, rose one basis point
to 12.16 percent at 10:29 a.m. New York time. Earlier, the
contract fell as much as two basis points.  The bank raised borrowing costs 0.5 percentage point at its
January and March meetings, to 11.75 percent. Traders expect the
central bank to raise rates by a quarter-point to 12 percent
this month, interest rate futures show.  Higher Forecast  Economists covering the Brazilian economy raised their 2012
consumer price forecast for a second straight week, the central
bank’s weekly  survey  published today showed.  According to the April 1 central bank  survey  of about 100
economists published today, Inflation will end 2012 at 5
percent, up from a week earlier forecast of 4.91 percent.  Economists in the survey raised their 2011 inflation
forecast for a fourth week, to 6.02 percent, up from a week-
earlier forecast of 6.00 percent.  The central bank’s analysis is that inflation expectations
are being driven by current price indexes, which rose to 6.1
percent in the 12 months through mid-March, the official said.
Commodity price increases probably slowed in March, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
