Saudi Aramco , the worldâ€™s largest
state-run oil company, plans to invest $80 billion on projects
to expand domestic capacity, al-Riyadh reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The Dhahran, Saudi Arabia-based company will spend $45
billion to increase its oil production capacity at the Shaybah
and other fields and $35 billion on downstream projects such as
petrochemical plants and refineries it plans to build with
international partners, the  newspaper  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
