The Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Co.
signed an agreement allowing it to increase the price of natural
gas sold to Union Fenosa SA, to reflect soaring global crude
prices, an official for the Egyptian company said today.  The two companies also agreed to eliminate the upper limit
on prices, said Enas El Sheikh, general manager at the Egyptian
company’s information department.  Union Fenosa, a unit of Barcelona-based Gas Natural SDG SA
that holds a 50 percent share of a gas-liquefaction plant in
 Egypt , didn’t reply to an e-mail seeking comment.  The Egyptian state-run company, known as EGAS, is also
negotiating to increase the price of natural gas it sells to
Jordan, El Sheikh said.  Egypt has 77 trillion cubic feet (2.18 trillion cubic
meters) of gas reserves and is the main producer of the fuel in
the eastern Mediterranean, according to the U.S. Energy
Department. The country exported 650 billion cubic feet in 2009,
30 percent of which went by the Arab  gas pipeline  to Jordan,
Syria and Lebanon, or via the El Arish-Ashkelon line to  Israel ,
according to the department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
