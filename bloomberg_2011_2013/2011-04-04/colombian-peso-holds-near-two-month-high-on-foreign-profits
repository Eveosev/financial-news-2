Colombia ’s peso held near a two-
month high as companies repatriated profits from foreign markets
before tax payments this month and on speculation the government
is bringing in dollars it left overseas last year.  The currency was little changed at 1,849.25 per  U.S.
dollar , from 1,849.19 on April 1, its strongest closing price
since Jan. 21. Earlier in the day, the peso climbed as much as
0.3 percent to 1842.95.  In a bid to ease gains in the local currency, Finance
Minister Juan Carlos Echeverry said in October that the
government would keep $1.5 billion overseas “at least for the
first months of 2011” instead of bringing the money into
Colombia and converting it to pesos. Echeverry has said the
government will bring the money in “slowly” in 2011.  “The government seems to be bringing in dollars, and so
are companies ahead of tax payments,” said  Carlos Torres , head
analyst at brokerage Asesores en Valores SA in Bogota.  Companies are slated to pay taxes between April 8 and April
25, he said.  An official at the  Finance Ministry  declined to comment on
whether the government was bringing dollars into the country.  Colombia’s peso bonds rose, pushing yields to fall to a
two-week low, as investors pared bets on quickening March
inflation.  The yield on the Colombian government’s benchmark 11
percent bonds due July 2020 fell 3 basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 8.14 percent, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. That’s its lowest level on a closing basis since March
16. The bond’s price rose 0.219 centavo to 118.086 centavos per
peso.  Agricultural Prices  Prices of fruits, vegetables and meat fell in March amid
increased supply, the Agriculture Ministry said in an April 3
 report .  “People are less worried about food prices and that’s
leading them to cut their inflation bets,” Torres said.  Annual inflation quickened to 3.37 percent last month,
according to the medium estimate of 24 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The national statistics agency is slated to release
the March inflation report tomorrow. The central bank targets
inflation between 2 percent and 4 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
