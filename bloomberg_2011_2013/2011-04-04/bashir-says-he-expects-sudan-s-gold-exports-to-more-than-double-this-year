Sudan ’s gold export revenue probably
will climb to $3 billion this year from about $1.4 billion in
2010, Sudanese President Umar al-Bashir told parliament.  Sudan will expand in gold mining and oil exploration in the
north as the oil-rich south prepares to declare its independence
on July 9, al-Bashir told the assembly in Omdurman, a suburb of
Khartoum, the capital.  After independence,  Southern Sudan  will assume control of
about three-quarters of the country’s current oil production of
490,000 barrels a day, pumped mainly by China National Petroleum
Corp.,  Malaysia ’s Petroliam Nasional Bhd. and  India ’s Oil &
Natural Gas Corp. Almost 99 percent of Southern Sudanese voters
chose to secede from the north and form an independent country
in a January referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
