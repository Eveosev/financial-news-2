Spain ’s registered unemployment
advanced for a third month in March, deepening the divide
between peripheral economies struggling to recover from the
financial crisis and  Germany ’s booming labor market.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits in
Spain rose by 34,406, or 0.8 percent, from February to 4.33
million, the  Labor Ministry  in Madrid said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Spain’s  unemployment rate  remains at more than 20 percent,
while the number of Germans out of work dropped to the lowest
since 1992 last month. Spain’s economy emerged from an almost
two-year recession in 2010 before contracting again in the third
quarter as austerity measures undermined the recovery.  As part of efforts to tackle the highest jobless rate in
 Europe , the Socialist government will present a plan this month
to encourage unregistered jobs to be declared, Prime Minister
Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero said last week.  The measures will offer short-term incentives for
underground workers to be legalized and will toughen penalties
on illegal labor and on people claiming  unemployment benefits 
while working for cash. As many as 500,000 informal jobs may be
registered, Expansion newspaper reported on March 31, citing
government advisers.  The doubling of the unemployment rate since the collapse of
the decade-long property boom and the deepest budget cuts in at
least three decades have eroded support for Zapatero, who said
on April 2 that he won’t run for a third term in elections
scheduled for 2012. The opposition  People’s Party  would win 44.1
percent of the vote if general elections were held now, compared
with 28.3 percent for Zapatero’s Socialists, according to a poll
by El Pais on April 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
