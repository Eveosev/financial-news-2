Duet Group’s Duet Commodities Fund
rose 6.5 percent last month after energy prices gained.  The return for the first quarter was 8.3 percent, Chief
Investment Officer Tony Hall said in an e-mailed response
to questions today. The fund is up 10 percent since it was
started in July, said Hall, former global head of distillates
oil trading at a joint venture of Credit Suisse Group AG and
Glencore International AG.  “The most successful area was energy,” Hall said.  Crude oil gained 17 percent in the first quarter as
commodities advanced for a third consecutive quarter. Oil,
copper and platinum-related metals will “present
opportunities” for the rest of the year, Hall said.  The Duet Commodities Fund invests in energy, metals
and foreign exchange. London-based Duet Group has more than $2.4
billion under management in  hedge funds , real estate,
infrastructure and funds of hedge funds, according to the
company.  To contact the reporters on this story:
