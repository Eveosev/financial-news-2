Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying futures increased to a 30-month high for a third
consecutive session. Battles at a Libyan oil port added to
concern about supply disruptions.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
May, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 30.1 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 30.4 percent April 1.  Crude for May delivery climbed 53 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$108.47 a barrel, the highest settlement since Sept. 22, 2008,
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices are up 28 percent
from a year earlier.  The most active contracts in electronic trading today were
May $110 calls with 1,147 lots changing hands. They slipped 12
cents to $1.51 a barrel. June $100 puts, the next-most active
contract, fell 23 cents to $1.27 a barrel with 1,082 contracts
trading. One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $125 calls were the most active options traded April
1, with 8,221 lots changing hands. They rose 6 cents to 91 cents
