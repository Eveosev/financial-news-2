Xstrata Plc (XTA) , the world’s biggest
energy-coal exporter, will lodge an updated application for
environmental approval to develop a coking coal and thermal  coal
mine  in Queensland.  Xstrata will add a haul-road to its application,  James Rickards , spokesman for the London-based company’s coal division,
said by phone from Sydney. The application will be lodged again
in the next two days, Rickards said.  Xstrata earlier withdrew its request, Australia’s
Department of Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and
Communities said on its website.  The Sarum Coal project, a joint venture with Itochu Coal
Resources Australia Pty Ltd., ICRA NCA Pty Ltd. and Sumisho Coal
Australia Pty Ltd., would produce coal from 2013-14 for a total
of 250 million metric tons over a mine life of 22 years,
according to the government notice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
