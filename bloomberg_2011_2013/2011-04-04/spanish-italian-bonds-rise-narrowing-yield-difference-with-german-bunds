Spanish and Italian 10-year bonds
rose, reducing the additional yield investors demand to hold the
securities instead of benchmark German bunds.  The yield on the 10-year Spanish security fell two basis
points to 5.30 percent as of 8:45 a.m. in  London , narrowing the
yield spread to bunds to 192 basis points from 194 basis points
on April 1.  Italian 10-year yields also fell two basis points, to 4.78
percent, 140 basis points more than bund yields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
