Deutsche Bank AG lowered its 12-
month estimate for the Topix index to 1,000 from 1,060, citing
the impact of the March 11 earthquake on corporate earnings and
a slump in manufacturing due to rolling power blackouts.  Deutsche Bank analyst Naoki Kamiyama estimated earnings per
share for the Topix at 55.2 for fiscal 2011, which started in
April, and 58.7 for fiscal 2012, according to a report dated
April 1. Kamiyama had earlier projected the value at 66 for 2011
and 72.4 for 2012.  Kamiyama will review his forecasts after companies report
earnings in May, he said in the report.  To contact the reporter on the story:
