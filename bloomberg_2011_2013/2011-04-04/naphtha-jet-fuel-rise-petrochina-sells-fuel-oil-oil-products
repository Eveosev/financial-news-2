Asia naphtha rose for the fourth
day, the longest increasing streak in four months. Jet fuel
climbed as BP Plc bought a cargo in  Singapore , the region’s
largest oil-trading center. PetroChina Co. sold fuel oil.  Light Distillates  Open-specification naphtha for delivery to  Japan  gained 1.5
percent to $1,013 a metric ton, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Prices advanced for the fourth day, the longest
rising streak since the five days to Nov. 30. The premium of
Japan-delivered naphtha to Brent, or the crack spread, increased
to $114.12. The spread was at $113.86 at the end of Asian
trading on April 1.  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline climbed 1.4 percent to $124.45 a
barrel, Bloomberg data showed. Gasoline’s premium to naphtha was
unchanged at $13.60 a barrel. This reforming margin doubled in
the previous quarter, signaling that the profit from making
gasoline over naphtha is increasing.  Morgan Stanley bought 50,000 barrels of 92-RON gasoline
loading April 21 to April 25 from ConocoPhillips at $124.50 a
barrel, traders said.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc bought 140,000 to 200,000 barrels of
88-RON gasoline loading in April from Total SA. Shell purchased
the cargo at a discount of $2.60 a barrel to prices of 92-RON
gasoline.  Middle Distillates  Jet fuel  gained $1.50, or 1.1 percent, to $136.65 a barrel,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The product gained for
the fourth day, the longest rally in almost a month. Gasoil, or
diesel, with 0.5 percent sulfur, increased $2.20, or 1.6
percent, to $136.75, the highest level since Aug. 5, 2008.  In Singapore, BP bought jet fuel from Vitol Group for a
second day, paying 20 cents a barrel over benchmark quotes,
traders said. That’s the same premium as in an April 1
transaction.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil was unchanged at 6 p.m.
Singapore time, after falling every day last week to 85 cents a
barrel, according to PVM Oil Associates, a broker. This regrade
was in the longest losing streak since July, indicating it’s
less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude rose 61
cents to $23.39 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread, up for a
third day, is a measure of refining profit.  Fuel Oil  Benchmark 180-centistoke fuel oil rose 1.9 percent to $679
a ton, according to Bloomberg data. The price of 380-centistoke
fuel oil, mainly used as marine fuel, was up 2.1 percent at
$671. Each variety reached the highest since Sept. 1, 2008.  In Singapore, PetroChina sold two 20,000-ton cargoes of
380-centistoke fuel oil to Shell at $4.50 and $5 a ton over
benchmark quotes, traders said.  China ’s biggest oil producer
also sold a 180-centistoke cargo to Vitol at a $2.50 premium.  Fuel oil ’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed for a third day
to $6.92 a barrel, signaling reduced losses from turning oil
into residual products, Bloomberg data showed. The premium of
180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade dropped to $8 a
ton, the lowest since March 1. A narrowing viscosity spread
means bunker gained less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
