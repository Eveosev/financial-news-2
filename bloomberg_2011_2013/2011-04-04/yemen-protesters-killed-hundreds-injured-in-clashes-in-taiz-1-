At least 15 protesters were killed
and hundreds injured as clashes between police and anti-
government protesters broke out for a second day in the
southwestern Yemeni city of Taiz, Sadek al-Shujaa, chief of a
local field clinic, said in a telephone interview today.  Thousands of protesters surrounded the local governor’s
office in Taiz, demanding an end to the 32-year rule of
President Ali Abdullah Saleh, Bushra al-Maktari, a local
organizer, said in a phone interview today. Police opened fire
and used tear gas against demonstrators in Taiz yesterday,
leaving at least one dead.  In the port city of Hodeida, at least nine protesters were
wounded in clashes with police, including at least one who
suffered a gunshot wound to the head, Abdulhafiz Mujaab, a
protest organizer, said in a phone interview today.  Daily protests calling on Saleh, a U.S. ally against al-
Qaeda, to step down have been held across the country since
January. Senior generals, lawmakers and tribal leaders have
abandoned his regime since the killing of 46 protesters in
Sana’a on March 18. The main opposition coalition is proposing a
transitional administration led by Vice President Abduraboo
Mansur Hadi.  To contact the reporters on this story:
