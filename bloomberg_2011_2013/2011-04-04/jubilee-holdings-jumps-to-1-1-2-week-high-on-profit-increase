Jubilee Holdings Ltd. (JBIC) , an insurer
with operations in five African countries, jumped the most since
November 2006 after the company more than doubled its dividend
as full-year profit soared 84 percent.  The stock gained 36 shillings, or 20 percent, to 216
shillings by the 3 p.m. close in the capital, Nairobi, the
highest level since September 2007.  Pretax profit increased to 2.53 billion shillings ($30.3
million) from 1.6 billion shillings, Chairman Nizar Juma said
after close of the last trading session on April 1. The company
declared a dividend of 5.5 shillings a share and will issue a
bonus share for every 10 already held, he said.  “The firm’s board increased the dividend payout by 110
percent,” Nairobi-based Sterling Investment Bank Ltd. said in
an e-mailed note to clients today. “We expect the good results,
especially the attractive dividend, payout to boost activity on
the counter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
