Gabonâ€™s President Ali Bongo Ondimba
has ordered the creation of 240-man military unit to fight
poaching after the carcasses of 30 elephants were found in the
Wonga Wongue reserve, the government said in an e-mailed
statement late yesterday.  Gabon is home to the rare Forest elephant.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
