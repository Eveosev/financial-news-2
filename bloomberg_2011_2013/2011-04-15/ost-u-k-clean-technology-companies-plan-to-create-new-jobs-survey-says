More than three-quarters of U.K.
clean-technology companies plan to create jobs within the next
year, the government-funded Carbon Trust said in a survey.  Seventy-seven percent of 312 companies polled in March said
they planned to expand their workforce this year and 37 percent
said they’ll seek new export markets within two years, the
Carbon Trust said today in an e-mailed statement.  The survey of companies that work in renewable power,
 energy efficiency  and pollution control found that confidence in
the industry has risen, according to the non-profit consultant
for low-carbon strategies. Company officials, asked to rate
their confidence level on a scale from one to 10 for today and a
year ago, gave a median score of eight for today, and six for
last year.  “Cleantech innovators are feeling optimistic about their
prospects and have ambitious plans for the future,” Benj Sykes,
director of innovations at the Carbon Trust, said in the
statement. “Access to finance, along with a stable policy
environment, will make or break these growth prospects.”  A total of 57 percent said they planned to raise funding in
the next year, while 29 percent said a lack of access to
financing is the main obstacle to expansion, a proportion that
rose to 40 percent among smaller companies with revenue of less
than 2 million pounds ($3.3 million.) The survey was carried out
for the trust by the Cleantech Group LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
