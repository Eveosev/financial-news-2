China ’s imports of natural gas  more
than doubled  in the first quarter compared with a year earlier
as the world’s biggest energy consumer expanded use of the
cleaner-burning fuel.  Gas purchases reached 6.3 billion cubic meters in the first
three months, comprising 3.1 billion cubic meters of piped
supplies from Central Asia and 3.2 billion cubic meters of
liquefied natural gas, the Beijing-based National Development
and Reform Commission said in a statement on its website today.  China wants to triple the use of natural gas to about 10
percent of its energy consumption by 2020 as it cuts reliance on
more-polluting coal. Imports met 19 percent of the nation’s
natural gas demand in the first quarter, up 7.6 percentage
points from a year earlier, the NDRC said.  Apparent gas demand, or net imports plus production and
excluding inventories, jumped 21 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier to 33.3 billion cubic meters, the NDRC said.  --Chua Baizhen. Editors: Ryan Woo, John Viljoen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
