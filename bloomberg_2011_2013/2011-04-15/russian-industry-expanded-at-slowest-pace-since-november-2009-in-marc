Russian industrial production
expanded in March at the slowest pace since November 2009 as
cost pressures constrained growth.  Output at factories, mines and utilities rose an annual 5.3
percent after a 5.8 percent increase in February, the Federal
Statistics Service in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement
today. The median estimate of 13 economists in a Bloomberg
survey was for an annual gain of 5.5 percent.  Growing producer prices are hampering investment and
restraining output even as demand for commodities picks up. The
Economy Ministry this week cut its growth forecast to 3.5
percent next year, compared with 4.2 percent in 2011.  “Companies are mainly damaged through the rapid increase
of their costs,” Natalia Orlova, chief economist at Moscow-
based  Alfa Bank , said today by phone before the release.
Increased domestic demand is boosting importers, signaling that
“Russian producers have a problem with their competitiveness.”  Manufacturing rose 8.6 percent in March from a year
earlier, compared with 10 percent in February. Output from
mines, including oil and gas fields, grew 3.1 percent from 3.2
percent in February.  To contact the reporter on this story:
