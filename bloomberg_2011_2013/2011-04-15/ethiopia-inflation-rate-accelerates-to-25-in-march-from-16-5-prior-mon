Ethiopiaâ€™s annual inflation rate
accelerated to 25 percent in March from 16.5 percent the prior
month, the Central Statistical Agency said in an e-mailed
statement on April 12.  The National Bank of Ethiopia abolished two-year old
lending caps on banks on April 4. The policy measure was taken
partly because montary and fiscal policies had controlled
inflation, Yohannes Ayalew, deputy governor of monetary
stability said on April 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
