Japanese Finance Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called on his Group of Seven counterparts to cooperate
after the nations jointly intervened in  currency markets  last
month to stem gains in the yen spurred by a March 11 earthquake.  “I called for appropriate cooperation while continuing to
closely watch the market” at the G-7 meeting, Noda said at a
press conference late yesterday in Washington after the
gathering. The G-7 agreed that the action taken on March 18 was
“significant” and “effective,” he said.  Noda said there was “no specific discussion” in response
to his request. Authorities stepped into foreign-exchange
markets last month, the first joint action in more than a decade,
to help reverse the yen’s surge to a postwar high.  The yen traded at 83.43 per dollar at 1:04 p.m. in  Tokyo .
It has weakened 9 percent from its 76.25 peak on March 17. Noda
said coordinated intervention could be helpful in preventing
excessive movements in the currency.  Bank of  Japan  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa, attending the
same press conference in Washington where G-20 members are also
gathering, said some nations identified Japan’s earthquake as
one of many risks for the global outlook, though no one signaled
it out as a major risk.  To contact the reporter on this story:
