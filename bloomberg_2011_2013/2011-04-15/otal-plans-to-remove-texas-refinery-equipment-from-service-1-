Total SA (FP)  plans to remove equipment
from service to repair a leak at its Port Arthur refinery in
Texas, according to a filing with state regulators.  Workers isolated an exchanger that appears to be leaking
process fluid into a heat-exchange system, the company said in a
 filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  Pat Avery, a spokeswoman for the plant, didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail asking if the incident affected production.  The leak is associated with the plant’s North Cooling
Tower, according to the filing.  The refinery has a capacity of 240,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
