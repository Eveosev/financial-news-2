The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options tumbled to a three-year low, driven down by smaller
equity price swings and a report showing manufacturing in the
 New York  region expanded in April at the fastest rate in a year.  The VIX, as the  Chicago  Board Options Exchange Volatility
Index is known, slumped 5.8 percent to 15.32 at 4:15 p.m. in New
York, after falling as low as 14.92 intraday. That’s the lowest
closing level since July 2007, a month before BNP Paribas SA,
 France ’s biggest bank, barred withdrawals from funds that owned
subprime loans, intensifying the financial crisis.  Price swings have narrowed for stocks, a situation that
tends to reduce the value of equity derivatives. The VIX
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, which moved within a 0.7
percent range between today’s high and low. The 10-day average
intraday swing stands at 0.9 percent.  S&P 500  price swings hit a
six-month high of 2.5 percent on March 16. The March 11
earthquake in  Japan  spurred a three-day slump of 3.6 percent in
the S&P 500.  “The market just hasn’t been moving much since the Japan
situation,” said Jeremy Wien, head of VIX options trading at
Peak6 Capital Management LLC in Chicago. “We tested 1,300
yesterday and popped right back up” on the S&P 500.  The S&P 500 closed at 1,319.68 today, up 0.4 percent. It
fell 0.6 percent this week. The VIX has averaged about 20.4 in
its two-decade lifetime.  The Federal Reserve Bank of New York’s general economic
index rose to 21.7 from 17.5 in March. Economists projected a
reading of 17, based on the median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey. Figures greater than zero signal factory expansion in
the so-called Empire State Index, which covers New York,
northern  New Jersey  and southern Connecticut.  To contact the reporters on this story:
