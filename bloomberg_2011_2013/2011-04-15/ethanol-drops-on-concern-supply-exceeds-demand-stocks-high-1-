Ethanol futures fell a fourth day
on concern that supply of the biofuel is outstripping demand.  The grain-based gasoline additive extended its longest
streak of losses since the period ending March 11 amid
speculation demand isn’t robust enough to soak up the record
20.5 million barrels that the Energy Department said were in
storage last week.  “Things are full and they’re not pushing the bids,” said
Ronnie Virissimo, a trader at SCB & Associates LLC in  Chicago .  Denatured ethanol for May delivery fell 2.1 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $2.618 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have risen 10 percent this year.  Production of the fuel fell 0.4 percent last week to
898,000 barrels a day, the Energy Department said April 13, the
lowest level since March 11.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  sank 5.5 cents,
or 2 percent, to $2.695 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
lost 3 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $2.60, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.785 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel dipped 2.5
cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.77.  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  breaking even on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
