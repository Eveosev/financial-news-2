Nigeria’s Economic and Financial
Crimes Commission called in the chief executives of two banks
for questioning over allegations of money laundering,  the
Guardian  said, without saying where it obtained the information
or naming the banks.  The chief executives of seven other lenders are also being
investigated for helping to divert 5 billion naira ($32.3
million) from the country’s Pension Fund, the Lagos-based
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
