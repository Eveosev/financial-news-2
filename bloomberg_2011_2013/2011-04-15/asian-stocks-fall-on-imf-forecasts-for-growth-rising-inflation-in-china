Asian stocks fell for the first
week in four as  China ’s inflation rose faster than estimated and
the  International Monetary Fund  cut growth forecasts for the U.S.
and Japan.  China Resources Land Ltd., a state-controlled developer,
slid 6.7 percent in Hong Kong on concern China will need to do
more to contain growth.  Rio Tinto  Group, the world’s No. 2 miner

world’s largest carmaker, lost 3 percent as Japan said problems
at a stricken nuclear plant were worse than previously stated.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.5 percent to 135.82
in the week. The gauge rose for three straight weeks previously
after the U.S. unemployment rate dropped to a two-year low and
companies from Hitachi Ltd. to Toyota said factories in Japan
shut after the nation’s strongest earthquake on record would
reopen this month.  “Investor sentiment is deteriorating because it seems
uncertainty is going to remain for a long period of time,” Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $270 million at Vivace Capital
Management Co. “There’s concern about how disruptions to
Japan’s supply chain will affect the global economy.”  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  dropped 1.6 percent, while
China’s Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index added 0.7
percent.  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index shed 1.8 percent. Japan’s
 Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 1.8 percent as the government
raised the severity rating of its post-earthquake nuclear crisis
to the highest level, matching the rating of the 1986 Chernobyl
disaster.  China Inflation  China Resources Land fell 6.7 percent to HK$14.60. China
Vanke Co., the country’s biggest-listed developer, dropped 2.7
percent to 8.9 yuan in the southern city of Shenzhen.  China said its economy grew a more-than-estimated 9.7
percent in the first quarter from a year before and the rate of
inflation accelerated to 5.4 percent in March from a year
earlier, the fastest pace since 2008. That exceeded the estimate
of a 9.4 percent increase in gross domestic product and price
increases at a rate of 5.2 percent, according to the median
estimates of economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank has raised the reserve-requirement ratio
for banks nine times since the start of 2010 and borrowing costs
four times.  “China’s economic growth remains robust,” said Benjamin Tam, a portfolio manager at IG Investment Ltd., which oversees
about $1.98 billion. “The government may continue to step up
tightening measures in the second quarter. The overall market
will remain optimistic because of the stronger growth, but there
could be some concerns on the rate hike.”  Commodity Producers  Rio Tinto dropped 2.4 percent to HK$84.15 in Sydney and
Cnooc Ltd., a Chinese offshore oil producer, sank 5.6 percent to
HK$19.58 in  Hong Kong  as oil and copper prices slumped in the
week. Crude slid 2.8 percent settling at $109.66 a barrel in  New
York , while copper prices declined 5 percent to $4.2775 a pound.  “Crude  oil prices  have pushed ahead of where fundamentals
currently suggest,” analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led by
 Jeffrey Currie  in  London  wrote in a report April 15. “The near-
term downside risk to prices has risen in recent weeks” on
“nascent signs of demand destruction in the  United States .”  In Sydney, James Hardie fell 3.6 percent to A$5.95. In

largest exporter of consumer electronics, retreated 5.9 percent
to 2,461 yen.  The  U.S. economy  will expand 2.8 percent this year, slowing
from 2.9 percent last year and less than the 3 percent growth
for 2011 forecast in January, the IMF said. The Washington-based
fund also cut its estimate of Japan’s growth to 1.4 percent from
1.6 percent in the previous forecast after the March 11
earthquake and tsunami.  To contact the reporters on this story:
