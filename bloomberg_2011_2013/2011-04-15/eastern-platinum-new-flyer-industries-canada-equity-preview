Canadian stocks fell for a third
day as  Standard & Poor’s  changed its outlook on the United
States’ credit ratings to “negative” and oil and metals
producers dropped on falling commodity prices.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU) , Canada’s largest oil and gas producer,
lost 2.2 percent after Saudi Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said the
“market is oversupplied.”  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) , the country’s
second-biggest lender by assets, declined 1 percent after S&P
reduced its outlook on the U.S. from “stable,” citing the
country’s budget deficit. BlackBerry  Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM) 
gained 3.3 percent after Barron’s said the shares may double.  The Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index decreased 96.79
points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,702.33, the lowest close since
March 16.  “It brings into focus there’s some hard choices to be
made, and nobody knows if the U.S. is being run by adults or
petulant children,” said David Baskin, president of Baskin
Financial Services Inc. in Toronto, which manages C$400 million
($414 million). “The U.S. is the biggest economy in the world,
and 75 percent of our exports go there.”  The S&P/TSX fell for the first time in five weeks last week
as the  International Monetary Fund  cut its growth forecast for
the U.S. and investors speculated  China  would tighten credit to
fight inflation. The People’s Bank of China increased banks’
reserve requirements for the fourth time this year yesterday.  ‘Material Risk’  In a public statement, S&P said “there is a material risk
that U.S. policymakers might not reach an agreement on how to
address medium- and long-term budgetary challenges by 2013.”  The U.S. projects its deficit will total 10.9 percent of
gross domestic product this year. President Barack Obama has set
a target of reducing the deficit to 2.5 percent of GDP by 2015.  The S&P/TSX Energy Index dropped to the lowest since Jan.
28 as crude declined for the first time in four days.  Suncor lost 2.2 percent to C$41.14.  Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM) ,
an oil and gas producer with operations in  North America , the
North Sea and  Indonesia , slumped 1.5 percent to C$22.04.  Cenovus
Energy Inc. (CVE) , Canada’s fifth-biggest energy company, decreased
2.1 percent to C$35.18.  An index of S&P/TSX financial companies retreated to the
lowest level in a month. TD fell 1 percent to C$81.28. Royal
Bank of Canada, the country’s largest lender by assets, slipped
0.5 percent to C$59.73.  Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) , North
America’s fourth-biggest insurer, dropped 1.6 percent to
C$16.18.  Metal, Coal Producers  S&P/TSX base-metals and coal producers fell for a sixth
day, the longest streak of declines since May, after China
raised banks’ reserve requirement to a record 20.5 percent from
20 percent. Copper also slipped for a sixth day.  Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK/B) , Canada’s largest base-metals and coal
producer, retreated for a ninth day, the longest streak of
losses since 2006, falling 2.1 percent to C$48.77.  First Quantum
Minerals Ltd. (FM) , the country’s second-biggest publicly traded
copper producer, decreased 1.9 percent to C$116.80.  Grande Cache
Coal Corp. (GCE) , which mines in Alberta, sank 7.5 percent to C$8.31.  Capstone Mining Corp. (CS) , which produces copper in  Mexico ,
slumped 4.3 percent to C$4.03 after agreeing to buy  Far West
Mining Ltd. (FWM)  for C$725 million in cash and stock. Far West, which
is developing a mine in  Chile , surged 7.3 percent to a record
C$8.24.  Gold,  U.S. Dollar   Precious-metals producers retreated as the U.S. dollar rose
as much as 1.9 percent, the most since November, against the
euro. Greek and Portuguese bond yields extended records on
concern about the possibility of sovereign-debt defaults.  Kinross Gold Corp. (K) , Canada’s third-largest gold producer,
fell 2.5 percent to C$14.67. Silver reseller  Silver Wheaton
Corp. (SLW)  dropped 2 percent to C$40.10.  First Majestic Silver Corp. (FR) ,
which mines in Mexico, declined 3.5 percent to C$21.91.  Eastern Platinum Ltd. (ELR) , which mines in  South Africa , tumbled
15 percent, the most since November 2008, to C$1.10 after saying
first-quarter production fell 17 percent from last year.  Lumber producers  Canfor Corp. (CFP)  and West Fraser Timber Co.
dropped after Paul C. Quinn, an analyst at Royal Bank of Canada,
cut his ratings on the shares to “underperform” from “sector
perform.” In a note to clients, Quinn cited the decline in
lumber prices and rise of the Canadian dollar.  West Fraser,  Canada ’s largest lumber producer, declined
6.8, the most since August 2009, to C$54.64. Canfor plunged 9.8
percent, also the most in 20 months, to C$12.56.  RIM rose 3.3 percent from a five-month low to C$52.84 after
Barron’s said the shares may gain as the company releases new
products. Canada’s biggest technology company has fallen eight-
straight weeks, the most since 2006, as it forecast profit below
analysts’ estimates and its PlayBook tablet generated negative
reviews from some media.  To contact the reporter on this story:
