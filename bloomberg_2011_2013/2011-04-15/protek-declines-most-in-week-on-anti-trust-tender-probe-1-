OAO  Protek (PRTK)  fell to its lowest level
in more than a week after  Russia ’s Anti-Monopoly Service said it
will  investigate  charges the Russian drugs wholesaler and 17
others companies rigged government drug-supply tenders.  The stock fell 3.5 percent to 41.06 rubles as of the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its weakest since April 5.  The regulator said 18 manufacturers, including Protek and
OAO  Pharmstandard (PHST) , are suspected of illegally colluding in
tenders in 2008 and 2009.  The probe could “negatively affect” the companies’ share
price, Tatiana Bobrovskaya, a equity analyst at Metropol Ifc,
wrote in a report today.  Pharmstandard fell for a second day, losing 0.8 percent to
2,600.1 rubles.  -- Editors: Alexander Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
