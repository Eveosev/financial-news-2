Tokyo  Electric Power Co. expects
electricity demand to exceed output by as much as 4.3 million
kilowatts this summer after the March 11 earthquake shut some of
its plants.  Tepco, as the utility is known, can supply 52 million
kilowatts by the end of July, compared with demand of as much as
55 million kilowatts, the company said in a statement today. At
the end of August, capacity will fall by 1.3 million kilowatts
to 50.7 million kilowatts as the No. 1 and 7 reactors at
Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear plant shut for maintenance, it said.  The utility lost 40 percent of its generation capacity
after the magnitude-9 earthquake and ensuing tsunami on March 11
shut its power plants. Among the idled plants is Tepcoâ€™s 4,696-
megawatt Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station, where engineers are
battling to cool down reactors and contain radiation leaks.  Tepco will use hydroelectric power and emergency sources to
increase its generation capacity, Vice President Takashi Fujimoto told reporters today.  The company, based in Tokyo, previously said it can supply
46.5 million kilowatts by the end of July, according to a March
25 statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
