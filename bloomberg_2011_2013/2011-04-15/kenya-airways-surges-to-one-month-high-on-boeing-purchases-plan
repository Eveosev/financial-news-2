Kenya Airways Ltd. (KNAL) , sub-Saharan
Africa’s third-biggest airline, rose to the highest in a month
after saying it will buy nine new  Boeing Co. (BA)  787  Dreamliner 
planes with an option to purchase four more aircraft.  The stock jumped 2.75 shillings, or 8 percent, to 37.25
shillings, the highest level since March 16, by the 3 p.m. close
in Nairobi. The increase was the biggest since Aug. 2.  Delivery of the planes, originally scheduled for October
2010, was delayed until October 2013, Kenya Airways said in a
statement handed to reporters yesterday.  “Confirming the delivery schedules is positive news
because one of their challenges has been an aging fleet and
capacity constraints,” Gregory Waweru, an analyst at Nairobi-
based Kestrel Capital East  Africa  Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
