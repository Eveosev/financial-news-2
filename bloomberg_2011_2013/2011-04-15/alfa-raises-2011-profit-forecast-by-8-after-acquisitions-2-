Alfa SAB,  Mexico ’s largest
privately owned chemical producer, increased its 2011 forecast
for cash profits by 8 percent after U.S. acquisitions of
chemical plants and a food company.  Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization -- a measure of  cash flow  known as Ebitda -- is
expected to be $1.6 billion this year, up from a previous target
of $1.48 billion in February, Alfa said in a statement.  Alfa in January paid $600 million for three  Eastman
Chemical Co. (EMN)  petrochemical plants in South Carolina and bought
Bar-S Foods Co., a Phoenix-based processed meat producer, in
September for $575 million, helping boost profit.  The company increased its Ebitda target at Alpek, its
chemical unit, to $675 million from $590 million in February and
boosted the estimate for food unit Sigma Alimentos to $400
million from $365 million. It left its Ebitda targets unchanged
at $398 million for auto-parts unit Nemak and $122 million for
its telecommunications company Alestra.  Last year, Alfa posted Ebitda of $1.26 billion. The company
doesn’t give a forecast for net income.  Alfa rose 5.56 pesos, or 3.3 percent, to 174.41 pesos, the
highest price since at least January 1992, at 4:10 p.m. New York
time in Mexico City trading. The shares have risen 40 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
