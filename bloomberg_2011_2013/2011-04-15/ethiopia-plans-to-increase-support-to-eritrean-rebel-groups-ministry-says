Ethiopia  will increase support to
Eritrean rebels seeking to overthrow the government of President
Isaias Afewerki, Ethiopia’s Foreign Ministry said.  “In the past, Ethiopia has given refuge to some opposition
groups and some limited support to the Eritrean resistance,”
the Addis Ababa-based ministry said in an e-mailed statement
today. “Now support to the opposition will be strengthened
further.”  The two countries fought a 1998-2000 border war that killed
70,000 people,  according  to Brussels-based  International Crisis
Group . Relations between the two countries have remained tense
as each backed opposing factions in nearby Somalia’s civil war.
Skirmishes between Ethiopian and Eritrean troops occasionally
break out along their 912-kilometer (567-mile) border.  Ethiopia has previously accused Eritrea of supporting
Ethiopian rebels and of attempting to disrupt last year’s
parliamentary elections. Three calls made to Eritrea’s  Ministry
of Information  after business hours were not answered.  “In light of Eritrea’s continuing nefarious campaigns,
Ethiopia will continue to work to force the regime to change its
policies,” the statement said. “Failing that it will be
prepared to change the government itself through any means at
its disposal.”  Afewerki and Ethiopian Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi  led
allied rebel groups that overthrew Ethiopia’s Communist Derg
regime in 1991. Eritrea, formerly an Ethiopian province, won
independence after a 1993 referendum.  To contact the reporter on this story:
