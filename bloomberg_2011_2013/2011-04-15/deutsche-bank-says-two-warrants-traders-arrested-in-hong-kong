Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
bank, said two warrants traders were arrested in  Hong Kong  amid
an investigation by the city’s Independent Commission Against
Corruption into alleged bribery related to fraudulent trading.  “Deutsche Bank was advised by the ICAC of the arrest of
two of its employees, both warrants traders in Hong Kong,”
spokesman  Michael West  said in an e-mailed statement. “The two
traders were immediately placed on leave from the bank until the
matter is resolved.”  Hong Kong’s anti-graft agency arrested 11 people, including
two senior bank employees, for alleged bribery linked to the
fraudulent trading of derivative warrants, it said yesterday.
The bankers are alleged to have accepted advantages from an
investor in return for quoting favorable prices for the
warrants, ICAC said, without identifying the bank or
individuals.  Those arrested as part of the operation code-named “leap
over” are also suspected of conspiring to defraud the bank and
investors by creating a false or misleading appearance of active
trading in the derivative warrants issued by the bank, ICAC
 said .  Deutsche Bank, based in  Frankfurt , isn’t being investigated
and is assisting ICAC with its enquiries, West said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
