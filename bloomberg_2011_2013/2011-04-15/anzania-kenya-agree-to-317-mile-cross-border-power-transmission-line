Kenya  and  Tanzania  agreed to build
a 510-kilometer (317-mile) transmission line linking the two
countries’ power grids, Mwikali Wambua, the project’s social
development officer, said.  The 400-kilovolt line will run from Nairobi, Kenya’s
capital, to Singida in central Tanzania, Wambua said in an
interview today in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial capital.
It is expected to cost about $226 million, according to a study
by Montreal-based RSW International Inc.  “Each government will individually raise funds for
constructing the part of the line on its territory,” Wambua
said. The line was one of three options considered, she said.  The transmission line is part of a bigger program to link
the power grids of Kenya,  Uganda , Rwanda, Burundi and eastern
Democratic Republic of Congo by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
