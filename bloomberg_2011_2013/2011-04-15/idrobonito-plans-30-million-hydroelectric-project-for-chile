Hidrobonito SA, a Chilean company,
sought permits to build two hydroelectric plants for $30 million
as the South American country tries to increase the
participation of renewable energy in its  power grid .  The two plants, which will have capacities of 9 megawatts
and 3 megawatts, are planned for the commune of Puerto Octay in
the south of  Chile , environmental licensing agency Comision
Nacional del Medio Ambiente said on its  website  April 13.  Chile  required  at the start of 2010 that mid-sized and
large power producers generate 5 percent of their electricity
from renewable sources, a cuota that rises to 10 percent in
2024, the highest in  South America .  Santiago-based Hidrobonito’s projects will provide power to
Chile’s Sistema Interconectado Central grid and qualify for
carbon credits under the United Nation’s Clean Development
Mechanism, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
