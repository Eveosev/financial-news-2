The Tokyo Stock Exchange Group Inc.
will allow firms whose liabilities exceed their assets because
of the country’s devastating earthquake and tsunami two years to
remedy the situation before being delisted, as opposed to the
year given in  normal circumstances .  The  measures  are aimed at helping companies and areas
damaged by the March 11 earthquake, the bourse said in a
Japanese-language  statement  posted on its website. The bourse
will promote listing of exchange traded funds composed of
companies involved in the rebuilding of areas damaged in  Japan ’s
record earthquake and the ensuing tsunami, the Tokyo bourse said
on its website today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
