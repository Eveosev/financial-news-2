Etalon Group Ltd., a developer that
builds high-rise apartment blocks in Moscow and  St. Petersburg ,
raised $575 million in an initial public offering and will use
most of the proceeds to buy land.  Etalon sold 82.1 million global depository receipts for $7
each in the London share sale, the St. Petersburg-based company
said in a statement today. That was at the bottom of the $7 to
$9 range used to canvass investor interest in the stock. Etalon
is expected to list on the London exchange on April 20.  The gross proceeds from the offering are expected to be
$500 million and the developer will use 70 percent of the money
to buy land, the statement said.  Credit Suisse Group AG (CS) ,
Renaissance Capital Ltd. and VTB Capital Plc managed the sale.  Most of Etalon’s projects are homes sold to middle-income
earners, including NSA Emerald Hills in Moscow and the NSA
Jubilee Estate in St. Petersburg. The company wants to buy land
or work with owners who have been prevented from developing
sites by borrowing restrictions or financial distress.  “Investors got burnt two years ago on Russian developers,
including  PIK Group (PIK)  and Sistema-Hals, who lost financial
solvency in the crisis and failed to implement the announced
investment plans,” said Julia Gordeyeva, an analyst at Deutsche
Bank in Moscow.  The shares were priced at about 1.6 times the asset value
of Etalon’s real estate, Gordeyeva said.  PIK Plunge  PIK listed shares at $25 in London in 2007. The stock
plunged from a peak of $32.50 in May 2008 to as low as 43 cents
in March 2009 and was at $4.44 as of 4:35 p.m. in London.  Sistema-Hals listed shares at $10.70 per global depositary
receipt in November 2006. Its stock plunged to 11 cents in
November 2008 and last traded at $1.34.  Russian companies are resuming share sales two months after
Nord Gold NV, OAO Koks and Chelpipe scrapped $2.5 billion of
planned IPOs, citing unfavorable market conditions. The
country’s 30-stock Micex Index has gained 5.5 percent this year
compared with a 2.5 percent increase for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index. The Micex fell for the second day, losing 0.1
percent to 1,780.36, by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow.  Isovoltaic AG, the biggest maker of solar-module
backsheets, today joined U.K. vacuum-pumps maker Edwards B Group
Plc, Indian billionaire Gautam Thapar’s BILT Paper Plc and
Internet-payment provider Skrill Group Plc that deferred  London 
IPOs this month citing a lack of investor demand, as concern
about corporate debt eroded interest in new issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
