Tokyo  Electric Power Co. said it
expects to make initial payments of about 50 billion yen ($600
million) to compensate evacuees from the area near the damaged
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear power plant.  The company plans to offer 1 million yen per household and
750,000 yen for single-person households within 30 kilometers of
the plant, President Masataka Shimizu said at a briefing in
Tokyo today. About 50,000 families who were ordered to leave
their homes or to remain indoors will receive the financial aid,
he said.  Tokyo Electric has tumbled more than 70 percent, the worst
performer on the  MSCI World (MXWO)  Index, since the March 11 earthquake
and tsunami knocked out cooling systems at the plant and caused
the worst nuclear disaster since Chernobyl. The company, known
as Tepco, may face claims of as much as 11 trillion yen, which
may lead to nationalization, Bank of America Corp.’s Merrill
Lynch said last month.  Chief Cabinet Secretary Yukio Edano said today the
government ordered Tepco to start paying evacuees of the
accident by the end of the month. The goal is to get the initial
compensation payments out before  Japan ’s Golden Week holidays,
which begin April 29, Edano said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
