A triptych of self portraits by
 Francis Bacon  may raise at least $20 million at auction next
month as demand grows for the U.K.’s most expensive artist.  “Three Studies for Self Portrait,” from 1974, are
included in Christie’s International’s May 11  New York  auction
of contemporary art. They are part of a  London  show, opening
tomorrow, that also includes Bacon’s 1952 painting, “Untitled
(Crouching Nude on Rail),” estimated at $10 million to $15
million in the same sale.  Owners of high-value paintings by Bacon are more confident
about selling at auction after the 1964 triptych, “Three
Studies for a Portrait of  Lucian Freud ,” fetched 23 million
pounds at Sotheby’s in London on Feb. 10.  “That result helped bring Bacons out of the woodwork,”
London-based dealer  Offer Waterman  said in an interview. “Up
until then the market had been in a state of flux. Prices had
dropped, and people found it difficult to value his paintings.”  Works by Bacon were in short supply at auctions during 2009
and 2010. In May 2008, before the financial crisis, Russian
billionaire  Roman Abramovich  paid a record $86.3 million for a
1976 “Triptych” at  Sotheby’s (BID)  New York, said dealers. Nine
months later, the 1954 picture “Man in Blue VI” failed to sell
at a Christie’s auction in London after being estimated at as
much as 5 million pounds ($8.2 million).  Both of these latest Bacons have been offered by
unidentified U.S. collectors and are being exhibited in the U.K.
for the first time,  Christie’s  said in an e-mailed statement.  Guaranteed Price  The triptych of head-and-shoulder studies, one of 10 self
portraits Bacon executed in the 1970s, has been owned for 35
years by the seller, who has been guaranteed a minimum price.
The canvas of the nude, which doesn’t have a price guarantee,
was one of a group of paintings by the artist discovered in a
storeroom in London’s Chelsea in the 1990s, Christie’s said.  The 37-work exhibition, continuing through April 19,
includes Impressionist and modern works from Christie’s May 4
sale, as well as contemporary pieces. Christie’s haven’t yet
released an overall estimate for its auctions.  Other works on show are by  Andy Warhol  and  Mark Rothko ,
whose rediscovered 1961 abstract, “Untitled No. 17,” -- with
rectangular fields of maroon and pink on an orange background --
carries an upper estimate of $22 million.  The works are on show from April 16 through 19, from 12
noon to 5p.m., at Christie’s, 8 King Street, St. James’s,
London.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
