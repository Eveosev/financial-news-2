Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI) , the fourth-
largest producer of the metal, agreed to buy  Iamgold Corp. (IMG) ’s
interests in its Tarkwa and Damang mines in Ghana for $667
million to increase its output and reserves.  It’s a “relatively low-risk transaction that should
increase the company’s international production and lower its
overall cost of producing gold,” Gold Fields said today in a
statement. The company already operates the mines and has a 71.1
percent stake, while Toronto-based Iamgold owns 18.9 percent.  Gold Fields is expanding as prices soar. Gold rose to a
record $1,488.18 an ounce in  London  today as faster inflation
and a weaker dollar boosts demand for the metal. Tarkwa and
Damang made up about a fifth of Gold Fields’ 3.5 million ounces
of production in 2010 and were its lowest-cost mines in  Africa .  “It’s a great deal,”  Leon Esterhuizen , an analyst at  RBC
Capital Markets , said from London today. “They’re buying about
5 percent additional production with about 5 percent of their
market value.” The deal could boost Gold Fields’ quarterly
adjusted earnings per share by about 10 percent, he said.  The company, based in Johannesburg, is also increasing its
stake in its Peruvian unit,  Gold Fields La Cima S.A.A. , with a
bid for the 8 percent it doesn’t own scheduled to close on April
20, Chief Executive Officer Nick Holland said yesterday.  Boosting Output  Gold Fields declined 0.6 percent to 122 rand by the 5 p.m.
close of Johannesburg trading. Iamgold slumped 8.7 percent to
C$19.27 at 4:18 p.m. in Toronto, the biggest decline since Dec.
17, 2009. The government of  Ghana  owns 10 percent of each of the
mines, as required under domestic law.  Iamgold is also seeking majority stakes in assets, and said
in February it will be able to use the proceeds from selling
minority holdings to achieve that goal.  “Upon completion of this transaction, we will have more
than 1 billion dollars in cash, cash equivalents and gold
bullion,” CEO Steve Letwin said in a separate statement. “This
sale is the first of several strategic initiatives.”  The deal gives Gold Fields an additional 181,000 ounces of
annual production at a cash cost of about $540 an ounce and 2.1
million ounces of reserves at about $302 an ounce, Holland said.
It will be funded with $500 million of an unused offshore
facility and about $160 million of the company’s cash, Chief
Financial Officer Paul Schmidt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
