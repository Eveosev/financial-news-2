Slovakia  may use proceeds from the
sale of state assets to cover its contribution to the European
Unionâ€™s permanent bailout fund,  Sme  reported, citing Finance
Minister Ivan Miklos.  Slovakia will need to contribute 659 million euros ($954
million) to the so-called European Stabilization Mechanism,
which will be created in 2013, the newspaper said. The
government expects to raise about 1.2 billion euros from sale of
state assets, Sme said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
