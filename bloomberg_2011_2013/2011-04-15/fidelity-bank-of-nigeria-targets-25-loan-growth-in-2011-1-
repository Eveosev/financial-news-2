Fidelity Bank Plc (FIDELITY)  of  Nigeria  aims
to expand lending by 25 percent this year, after an increase of
13.5 percent in 2010, and cut the rate of non-performing
financing, it said.  The Lagos-based lender will sell more debt to the Asset
Management Corp. of Nigeria and cut the rate of bad loans to 4
percent by the end of this year, from 25 percent in 2010, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  It also plans to recover finances from debtors and sell the
assets that back the loans to buyers other than Amcon, as
Nigeria’s debt-purchasing company is known.  Nigeria’s government set up Amcon following a debt crisis
in 2008 and 2009 that threatened the banking industry with
collapse. As of December, Fidelity has sold 1.6 billion naira
($10.3 million) of bad debt to Amcon, according to the
statement.  The bank plans to boost lending to agriculture,
telecommunications, construction, power and energy, it said.  The company’s stock declined for the for the first day in
three, falling 1 kobo, or 0.4 percent, to 2.75 naira by the 2:30
p.m. close in Lagos. The stock has gained 2.2 percent this year,
compared with a 1.5 percent rise in the Nigerian Stock Exchange
All-Share Index over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
