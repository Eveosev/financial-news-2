Galp Energia SGPS SA (GALP) , Portugal’s
biggest oil company, said the volume of refined product sales
fell 19 percent in the first quarter after its Sines refinery
was shut in January.  The company processed 39 percent less crude than in the
first three months of 2010, Lisbon-based Galp said today in a
regulatory filing. The Rotterdam cracking refining margin, a
measure of profit from turning a barrel of crude into fuels, was
negative at $0.50 a barrel in the first quarter from $1.90 a
barrel a year earlier, the company said.  The Sines refinery was shut in January to install new units
as part of a conversion project, Chief Executive Officer Manuel
Ferreira de Oliveira said on Feb. 11. The refinery in Oporto can
process about 90,000 barrels a day, while the Sines plant has a
220,000-barrel-a-day capacity.  Galp is expanding exploration in regions such as  Brazil ’s
offshore  Santos Basin , where the Lula project is located, and
 Angola  to improve access to crude supplies and rely less on
refining and sales of fuel in Portugal and  Spain .  The company on March 14 said it aims to raise about 2
billion euros ($2.89 billion) from a capital increase at its
Brazilian unit as it develops offshore projects in the Latin
American nation. It will invest about 3.5 billion euros in the
2012-2015 period, with exploration and production representing
70 percent of the total.  Average working interest production rose 2.7 percent from a
year earlier to 19,000 barrels a day, while average net
entitlement production fell 24 percent to 9,600 barrels a day.
Natural-gas sales rose 36 percent to 1.61 billion cubic meters.  Galp shares have gained 3.9 percent this year, giving the
company a market value of 12.4 billion euros.  Eni SpA (ENI) ,  Italy ’s
biggest oil company, and Portuguese holding company Amorim
Energia BV each control a third of Galp.  Galp is due to report first-quarter earnings on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
