(Corrects authorization year in second paragraph.)  Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD)  currently has no
plans to raise more capital, Chief Financial Officer Steven Tomsic told shareholders at their annual meeting in Munich
today.  The company is asking shareholders to authorize an increase
in share capital of up to 50 percent to “maximize Sky’s
flexibility in managing its  capital structure  in an efficient
and effective manner,” Tomsic said, according to a copy of a
speech he delivered today. If approved, the authorization will
be valid until April 2016.  According to the  invitation  to the meeting, the board can
exclude shareholders’ subscription rights in a capital increase,
provided it doesn’t exceed 20 percent of the total share
capital. Last year, Sky Deutschland raised a total of 448
million euros through share and bond sales and shareholder
loans, according to Tomsic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
