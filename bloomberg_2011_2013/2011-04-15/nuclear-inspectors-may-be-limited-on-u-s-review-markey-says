U.S. nuclear inspectors examining
domestic  power plants  amid a reactor crisis in  Japan  may keep
some findings secret, which might undermine confidence in the
agency’s work, Representative  Edward Markey  said.  The U.S.  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  is reviewing how the
reactors would cope if struck by a natural disaster. The 90-day
review was triggered when Tokyo Electric Power Co.’s Fukushima
Dai-Ichi plant in Japan was crippled by fires, explosions and
radiation leaks after a magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami on
March 11.  NRC inspectors are examining U.S. reactors’ ability to
withstand disasters that “have already been contemplated” as
well as those that are worse than expected, Markey said today in
a letter to agency Chairman  Gregory Jaczko .  The inspectors have been told to limit their public
findings to assessing safety measures for anticipated events,
Markey said, without identifying the source for the information.
The potential impact of disasters that exceed a reactor’s design
“would be entered into a private NRC database and kept
secret,” Markey said.  “These limitations, if true, severely undermine my
confidence” in the NRC’s safety review, Markey said.  The agency “always documents any inspection findings of
importance, although reports dealing with security-related
information are not made public,” Scott Burnell, an NRC
spokesman, said in an e-mail. The agency’s review will include
open meetings “and its results will be publicly available,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
