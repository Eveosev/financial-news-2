Russia  may raise its export duty on
most crude shipments by 2.8 percent on June 1 as  oil prices 
climbed toward the record set in 2008.  The standard duty will probably increase to between $463
and $466.40 a metric ton ($63.60 a barrel) from $453.70 a ton in
May, according to Bloomberg calculations based on Finance
Ministry data. Oil taxes reached a high of $495.90 a ton in
August and September 2008.  The discounted rate on oil pumped via Russia’s East
Siberian-Pacific Ocean pipeline to  Asia  and from the  Caspian Sea 
may reach within a range of $218.20 to $220.50 a ton from
$211.70 in May.  Brent and Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, rose
above $100 a barrel in February as unrest in northern  Africa  and
the Middle East disrupted some oil flows. Russia sets its export
duties based on the average Urals price from the 15th day of one
month to the 14th day of the next. Urals will probably be
$116.43 to $117.14 during this monitoring period,  Alexander Sakovich , a Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone today.  Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  must sign the draft for the
rates to come into effect.  A special gasoline tax that Putin imposed starting May 1 to
fight domestic shortages may be raised to $418 to $420 a ton,
Sakovich said. That is about 90 percent of the crude duty.  The export tax on light oil products may be increased to
$310.20 to $312.40 a ton from $304. The duty on heavy products
may rise to $216.20 a ton to $217.80 from $211.80 a ton.  OAO Rosneft’s Vankor field, TNK-BP’s Verkhnechonsk deposit
and OAO Surgutneftegas’s Talakan project lost discounts and have
had to pay full taxes since May 1, under the previous  order 
signed by Putin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
