International securities regulators
will seek extra regulation for agricultural and other
 commodities markets , the  International Organization of
Securities Commissions  said in an e-mailed statement.  IOSCO plans to extend its existing work on commodities
beyond assessing the transparency and functioning of oil
markets, the group of supervisors said.  “Other markets including agricultural markets are crucial
for our economies,” IOSCO said. The “expanded focus” is
“likely to lead to proposals to improve market transparency,
oversight and anti market-abuse treatment for these commodities
markets where necessary.”  France  has made the regulation of commodities markets one
of the priorities for its presidency of the Group of 20 nations
in 2011. European Union finance ministers on April 9 approved
recommendations for stricter oversight of commodity-derivatives
trading following concerns that speculation is driving up prices
for raw materials.  IOSCO, based in  Madrid , brings together securities
regulators to set international standards for supervision of
financial markets. Its members include the U.K. Financial
Services Authority and the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  To contact the reporters on this story:
