Keli Lane, a former Australian
water polo champion, was sentenced to 18 years in prison for the
murder of her baby daughter, 15 years after the infant
disappeared, Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported.  Lane, 35, won’t be eligible for parole for 13 years and
five months, ABC said.  Lane had pleaded not guilty to murdering her second child
Tegan in 1996 and claimed she turned the baby over to the father,
which whom she had a brief and secret affair, ABC said. The
child’s body was never found.  New South Wales Supreme Court Judge Anthony Whealy said he
accepted that Lane had deliberately killed the baby and had
planned to do so, ABC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
