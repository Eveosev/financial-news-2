The largest developed nations must
improve education and fiscal reforms to prevent the economic
malaise that followed the financial crisis from extending for a
decade, said  Angel Gurria , secretary-general of the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development.  “The greatest concern we have at the OECD is that this
undesirable or mediocre scenario, it’s not just for this year
and next,” Gurria said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television in  Washington  yesterday. “It looks mediocre for 2015,
even for 2020, in the absence of structural policy measures.”  The recovery in advanced economies including the U.S. and
Germany remains too slow to make large reductions in
unemployment, the  International Monetary Fund  said in January.
The  European Central Bank  last week raised its main lending rate
from a record low to curb inflation, putting more pressure on
the euro region’s weaker economies.  Gurria, the former Mexican finance minister who has led the
Paris-based OECD since 2006 and is scheduled to begin his second
five-year term in June, said  Europe ’s debt problems are limited
to Greece, Ireland and  Portugal . Portugal was the latest nation
to seek a European Union-led bailout after Greece sparked a
sovereign-debt crisis that threatened to splinter the euro
region a year ago and forced Ireland to seek external help in
November.  “I do not see that other countries will be needing these
kinds of relief,” Gurria said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
