Copper in  London  erased gains
in Asian trading, heading for a weekly loss, on concern record
production in China bolstered supplies and further government
curbs on lending may dim the outlook for domestic metal demand.  Three-month-delivery copper on the London Metal Exchange
dropped 0.2 percent to $9,393.75 a metric ton at 3:23 p.m.
Singapore time, reversing an earlier gain of as much as 1.1
percent. The contract dropped to $9,350 a ton yesterday, the
lowest since April 5. All six LME metals advanced.  China’s output of refined copper increased in March to
470,000 tons, up 24 percent from a year earlier, the statistics
bureau said today. That’s a monthly record, according to
Minmetals Starfutures Co.  “ China  is quite well-supplied at the moment and this will
weigh on the mood in the market,” said Minmetals’ analyst  Li Ye .
“It’s unclear what demand is, but it definitely doesn’t feel
like the peak season.”  July-delivery copper on the Comex in  New York  traded
dropped 0.4 percent to $4.2885 a pound, erasing gains of as much
as 0.7 percent earlier. The metal for June-delivery on the
Shanghai Futures Exchange fell 0.4 percent to end the day at
70,830 yuan ($10,847) a ton.  Copper in London lost 4.8 percent this week, the most since
the week ended March 11, on concern that China may extend its
credit-tightening measures to cool inflation, weighing on metals
demand. China’s consumer prices jumped 5.4 percent in March, the
fastest pace since 2008, more than the median 5.2 percent
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of economists.  China’s Economy   The Chinese economy grew 9.7 percent in the first quarter
of this year and its foreign-exchange holdings jumped to a
record $3 trillion, prompting speculation the government may
further curb lending. Chinese officials are reining in lending
to counter inflation after a record expansion of credit in 2009
and 2010, with the central bank boosting  interest rates  four
times since mid-October and raising banks’ reserve requirements.  “Demand in China isn’t as strong as many are expecting,
however hand-to-mouth buying during dips keeps a floor on
prices,” Shen Xiaoqiang, senior analyst at Donghai Futures Co.,
said from Suzhou. “We’re seeing price gains even in the face of
rising inventories, which could only mean there are still many
bulls out there supporting the market.”  Inventories in LME warehouses have risen 19 percent this
year, climbing to a nine-month high of 450,800 tons yesterday,
while stockpiles in warehouses monitored by the Shanghai
exchange were up 17 percent on year and stood at 154,229 tons
last week.  Aluminum in London rose 0.3 percent to $2,650.25 a ton,
zinc climbed 0.5 percent to $2,411 a ton, lead advanced 0.5
percent to $2,626 a ton, nickel increased 1.4 percent to
$26,170 a ton and tin gained 1 percent to $32,550 a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
