Srishti Anand, an analyst at Angel
Broking Ltd., said  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) ’s earnings per
share forecast for the year that began on April 1 is
“disappointing.”  Infosys shares tumbled 7.2 percent to 3,067.8 rupees, their
steepest decline in 11 months. The Bombay Stock Exchange’s
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, in which Infosys is the second-
biggest weighted stock, declined 0.9 percent to 19,526.62 at
a.m. 9:59 a.m. in Mumbai.  On earnings:  “The results aren’t very impressive, much below
expectations. They are on the not-so-good side.”  On fiscal 2012 forecasts:  “Annual guidance in terms of dollar sales of 18 percent to
20 percent was expected, as the company tends to be
conservative. But on the EPS front, the guidance is too off for
next year at $2.88 a share. We were expecting close to 19
percent growth in the EPS for the next year.  ‘‘We need to know why they are guiding for lower EPS and
what margin they are looking at.’’  On first-quarter forecasts:  ‘‘The sales guidance for next quarter is also muted, hardly
3 percent to 4 percent growth. Investors were factoring in this
kind of sales this quarter itself, while the company is
forecasting it for the next quarter.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
