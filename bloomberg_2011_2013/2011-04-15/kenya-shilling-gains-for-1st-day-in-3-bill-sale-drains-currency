Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in three days against the dollar as the central
bank sold the most 91-day Treasury bills in a month, draining
supplies of the local currency in the market.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy strengthened
as much as 0.4 percent to 83.80 per dollar and traded 0.2
percent up at 83.94 at 3.45 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  The central bank sold 4.24 billion shillings ($50.5
million) of 91-day bills at an auction yesterday, more than
double the amount it had offered, it said in an e-mailed
statement from Nairobi. It was the biggest sale since March 17,
when the bank sold 8.46 billion shillings of the debt. The yield
at yesterday’s sale climbed to 3.461 percent from 3.157 percent
at the previous auction.  “The local unit has strengthened over the dollar due to
tight liquidity occasioned by yesterday’s oversubscription of
Treasury bills,” Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
