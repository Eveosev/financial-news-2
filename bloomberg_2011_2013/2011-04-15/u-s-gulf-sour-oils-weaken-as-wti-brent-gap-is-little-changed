U.S. Gulf sour crudes weakened as
Brent oil’s premium over the U.S. benchmark, West  Texas 
Intermediate, was little changed and as regional inventories
rose to the highest since December.  The gap between June-delivery WTI and its European
counterpart decreased 11 cents to $13.19 a barrel at 2:17 p.m.
in New York. When Brent falls versus WTI, it weakens the value
of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil
priced against the European grade.  U.S.  Gulf Coast  oil inventories rose 404,000 barrels to
172.8 million barrels last week, the Energy Department said on
April 13. That’s the highest level since Dec. 10.  Among Gulf Coast sour, or high-sulfur, grades, Mars Blend’s
premium over the U.S. benchmark weakened 15 cents to $10.20 a
barrel at 12:23 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Poseidon’s premium lost 35 cents to $10.90.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium weakened 25 cents to $9.75
a barrel. Thunder Horse gained 30 cents to $15.20 over WTI.  West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at $3.40 a barrel.
It has tracked more closely to its historical average discount
versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas, away from
the Gulf Coast and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium strengthened 25 cents to
$18 a barrel over the benchmark. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
widened 60 cents to $17.60 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $12.60 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select narrowed 25 cents to
$15.60 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
