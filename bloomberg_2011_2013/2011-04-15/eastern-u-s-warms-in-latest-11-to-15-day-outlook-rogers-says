The eastern U.S. will probably be
seasonable to warmer than normal through the last week of April,
according to forecasters.  Commodity Weather Group LLC’s   Matt Rogers  is calling for
the East to warm up in his latest 11- to 15-day outlook, while
MDA EarthSat Weather keeps the Northeast in the seasonable range
and calls for warming across the South.  Rogers dropped yesterday’s prediction that an area across
the northern U.S. into the Canadian Maritimes would be cooler
than normal. Today, he has that area experiencing seasonable
weather and isolates the potential for cooler air mainly to the
 Rocky Mountains .  MDA also backed off its prediction from yesterday that the
Northeast may be cooler.  In the 6- to 10-day forecast, the pocket for potentially
cooler air extends from Montana to the Great Lakes, and the area
of warming in the South includes much of the Southwest, Rogers,
based in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in a note to clients. MDA’s
forecast is similar.  Natural gas traders monitor forecasts to assess changes in
demand for the fuel, used in heating and power generation.
Commodity traders watch precipitation forecasts for the
potential impact on planting and crop yields.  New York ’s average temperature in mid-to-late April is
about 54 degrees Fahrenheit (12 degrees Celsius), according to
 MDA in Gaithersburg, Maryland . The average temperature in  St.
Louis  is about 58 degrees; in Boston, 50; in Philadelphia, 55;
in Atlanta, 62; and in Dallas, 66.  To contact the reporter on this story:
