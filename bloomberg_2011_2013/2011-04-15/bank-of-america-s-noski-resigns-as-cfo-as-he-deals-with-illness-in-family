Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender by assets, said Charles Noski will be replaced as
chief financial officer after the illness of a family member
prevented him from moving to Charlotte,  North Carolina , where
the company is based.  Bruce Thompson, 46, will become CFO by the end of June and
remain chief risk officer until a successor is named to that
post, the company said today in a statement. Noski, 58, will
become vice chairman and be based in Los Angeles.  To contact the reporter on this story:
