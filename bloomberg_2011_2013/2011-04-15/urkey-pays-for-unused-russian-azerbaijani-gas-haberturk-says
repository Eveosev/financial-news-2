 Turkey ’s state-owned pipeline company known as Botas, will pay a
total of $2.64 billion for gas it didn’t use in the past three
years,  Haberturk  reported.  The so called take-or-pay fine is for about 3.6 billion
cubic meters of unused gas under its contract with  Russia  and 55
million cubic meters from Azerbaijan in 2010, the Istanbul-based
newspaper said, citing unidentified energy ministry officials.  Turkey may have to pay again for same amount of unused gas
contracted for 2011, Haberturk said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
