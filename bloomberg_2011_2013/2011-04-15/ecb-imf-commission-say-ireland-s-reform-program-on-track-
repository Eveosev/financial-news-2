The  European Central Bank , the
European Commission and the  International Monetary Fund  said
Ireland’s program to reduce its  budget deficit  and restore its
banking system to health are “on track.”  “Ireland is making good progress in overcoming the worst
economic crisis in its recent history,” the three institutions
said in a joint statement today after conducting a review. “The
program is on track, but challenges remain and steadfast policy
implementation will be key.”  Ireland’s credit rating was cut two levels by Moody’s
Investors Service today to the lowest investment grade as the
government faces the challenge of lowering its deficit while
trying to restore economic growth. The country secured a
European Union-led bailout in November after investor
uncertainty about debt sustainability drove up borrowing costs.  The Irish economy will resume growing this year, “albeit
more slowly than previously forecast,” after contracting 1
percent in 2010, the ECB, IMF and Commission said.  Deficit targets set for the end of December and the end of
March were met with a “comfortable margin,” they added,
projecting a budget shortfall of 10.5 percent of gross domestic
product in 2011.  “Comprehensive recapitalization and reforms” of the
banking system are a “major step towards restoring the Irish
banking system to health,” the institutions said. “These steps
are crucial for enabling the banking system to become a driver
of economic recovery.”  They said that the new government “has taken full
ownership of the goals and key elements of the program.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
