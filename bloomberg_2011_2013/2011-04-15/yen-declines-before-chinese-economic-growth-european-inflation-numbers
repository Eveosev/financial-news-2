The euro dropped against the dollar
and yen as concern the region’s debt crisis is getting worse
pushed the extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year
bonds instead of German debt to a record 10 percentage points.  The yen rallied versus most of its major counterparts on
damped demand for growth assets after China said inflation
reached the fastest pace in more than two years, reviving
speculation the world’s second-largest economy will cool growth.
 New Zealand ’s dollar surged to a three-year high against the
greenback as Finance Minister Bill English said the nation’s
accelerating inflation won’t hamper the economy.  “The market is looking at periphery debt problems,” said
Mamoru Arai, a senior currency trader at Mizuho Financial Group
Inc. in New York. “That is hurting the euro-positive interest
differentials against the dollar and yen.”  The euro decreased 0.4 percent to $1.4430 at 5 p.m. in New
York, from $1.4488 yesterday, and had a 0.4 percent weekly drop.
The euro slid 0.8 percent to 119.96 yen, from 120.97. The dollar
dropped 0.4 percent to 83.13 yen, from 83.50.  Sweden’s krona advanced for a third day versus the dollar,
gaining 0.5 percent to 6.1848 on speculation the Riksbank will
increase its target lending rate by a quarter-percentage point
to 1.75 percent on April 20. The krona appreciated 0.9 percent
to 8.9243 versus the euro.  Stronger Kiwi  The kiwi rose 0.7 percent to 79.95 U.S. cents after
touching 80.01, the highest level since April 2008 on English’s
remarks. The New Zealand currency rose 2.1 percent this week
versus the greenback.  “There will be some pressures there as the economy picks
up, but we’re in pretty good shape on inflation,” English said
in an interview with Bloomberg Television today at the Boao
Forum for  Asia  in southern China’s Hainan province.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Greek 10-year debt
instead of equivalent German securities widened to 1,000 basis
points, the most since before the euro’s debut in 1999.  Greece ’s
10-year yield climbed to a record high of 13.52 percent as the
government planned measures to reduce the  budget deficit .  The cost of insuring Greek sovereign debt jumped 51 basis
points to a record 1,147 basis points, according to CMA prices
for credit-default swaps. The contracts show there’s a 63
percent chance the nation will default within five years.  ‘Increased Worries’  “Increased worries about defaults in the periphery are
weighing yet again on the euro,” said  David Mann ,  New York- 
based head of research in the Americas at Standard Chartered
Plc.  “It’s also been very tough to stay above the $1.45 level,
which is a major psychological level.”  The euro touched $1.4520 on April 12 and 13, the highest
level since January 2010. The currency has gained 7.8 percent
versus the dollar this year and 10 percent against the yen as
the  European Central Bank  increased its main refinancing rate
last week to 1.25 percent and indicated further increases may
follow. The  Federal Reserve  and the Bank of  Japan  have kept
their target rates at almost zero.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, a gauge of
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, rose 0.2 percent to 74.833, paring the weekly drop to
0.3 percent. The gauge fell yesterday to 74.617, the lowest
level since December 2009, on speculation rising commodity
prices won’t be enough to persuade Fed policy makers to allow
 interest rates  to advance.  Investment Flow  Global demand for U.S. stocks, bonds and other financial
assets fell in February from a month earlier, the Treasury
Department said today. Net buying of long-term equities, notes
and bonds totaled $26.9 billion during the month, compared with
net buying of $51.1 billion in January.  The yen rallied on demand for a refuge as  China ’s economy
grew 9.7 percent in the first quarter, while consumer prices
increased 5.4 percent in March from a year earlier. The median
forecasts in Bloomberg News surveys of economists were for
economic growth of 9.4 percent and inflation of 5.2 percent.  “Chinese inflation backs expectations the People’s Bank of
China is likely to tighten policy in the months ahead,” said
 Joe Manimbo , a market analyst in  Washington  at Travelex Global
Business Payments, a currency-exchange network. “That could
mean slower global growth, which tends to unsettle investor
appetite for risk and inspire demand for safety and the yen.”  The yen has remained weaker than 80 versus the dollar since
March 18, when the Group of Seven acted to curb the currency’s
gains and support Japan’s export-driven economy. The currency
had rallied to a post-World War II record on bets insurance
companies would repatriate funds to help pay for quake damage.  Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the G-7
intervention was a “very important” effort to contain a risk
to the global economy. Geithner made brief remarks at the
Treasury Department, where he met Japanese Finance Minister
 Yoshihiko Noda . The two conferred as the G-7, the Group of 20
and the  International Monetary Fund  met.  To contact the reporter on this story:
