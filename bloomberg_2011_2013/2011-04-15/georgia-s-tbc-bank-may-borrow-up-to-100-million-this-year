TBC Bank ,  Georgia ’s second-largest
lender, may borrow as much as $100 million this year through
private placements, according to General Director Vakhtang
Butskhrikidze.  “We plan borrowing this year up to $100 million in private
placements in a bid to increase our credit portfolio,”
Butskhrikidze said today in a phone interview from Tbilisi. The
