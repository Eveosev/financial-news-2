The Boston  Red Sox  agreed on a
seven-year, $154 million contract extension with first baseman
Adrian Gonzalez, Comcast SportsNet New England said on its
website.  The accord with Gonzalez, who was acquired during the
offseason from the  San Diego Padres , will be announced today,
 CSNNE.com said , citing unidentified people.  By waiting until after the beginning of the Major League
Baseball season, the Red Sox were able to use Gonzalezâ€™s $6.5
million salary against the luxury-tax threshold, rather than the
new salary figure, the website said.  Gonzalez, an All-Star each of the past three years, has a
.268 batting average with one home run and seven runs batted in
through 11 games this season. The 28-year-old has a career .284
batting average with 169 homers and 532 RBI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
