Grupo Televisa SA (TLEVICPO) , the world’s
largest Spanish-language broadcaster, said first-quarter profit
fell 18 percent as its broadcast-advertising business slowed.  Net income dropped to 870.7 million pesos ($74 million)
from 1.06 billion pesos a year earlier, Mexico City-based
Televisa said in an e-mailed statement yesterday. That missed
the 922 million-peso forecast of Gregorio Tomassi, an analyst at
Banco Santander SA in Mexico City. Sales rose 8.7 percent to
13.2 billion pesos.  Televisa is seeking growth from its pay-TV businesses as
sales expand more slowly in its Mexican broadcasting unit. The
over-the-air TV division is contending with the loss of
advertising from the companies controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim  after a disagreement over pricing.  Sales in the broadcast business, Televisa’s largest
division, fell 1.8 percent from a year earlier to 4.11 billion
pesos. Operating profit in the unit slid 11 percent to 1.43
billion pesos.  Depreciation and amortization costs rose 20 percent to 1.78
billion pesos, hurting net income, Televisa said.  Satellite subscriptions increased by 268,000 to 3.3
million, while the three cable systems controlled by Televisa
added more than 40,000 TV customers for a total of 2.01 million.  The company said this month it agreed to buy full control
of its Cablemas SA unit for 4.7 billion pesos to add the 42
percent of the company it didn’t already own. Televisa also
agreed to acquire a 50 percent stake in Grupo Iusacell SA for
$1.6 billion to get access to  Mexico ’s mobile-phone market.  Televisa fell 53 centavos to 52.71 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 10:10 a.m. New York time. The shares had declined 17
percent this year before today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
