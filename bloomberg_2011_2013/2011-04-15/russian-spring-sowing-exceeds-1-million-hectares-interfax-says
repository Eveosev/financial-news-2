Russian spring sowing exceeded 1
million hectares (2.47 million acres), Interfax said today,
citing Pyotr Chekmarev, director of the planting department at
the Agriculture Ministry.  The government planned to sow 30 million hectares of grains
this spring. The weather has delayed  Russia ’s spring sowing by
two weeks, Agriculture Minister  Yelena Skrynnik  said yesterday.  Chekmarev said it is raining and he doesn’t expect above-
average temperatures like in 2010.  Last year 3.1 million hectares of spring grains were sown
as of April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
