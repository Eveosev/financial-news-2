Rwandatel SA, a mobile-phone
operator in the East African nation that had its operating
license revoked, denied claims by the government it was in debt
at a bankruptcy hearing today.  Profits are low, Kayihura Didas, a lawyer for the Libyan-
owned company said in court in Kigali, the capital, today. He
asked the court to halt the proceedings while another court
heard an appeal on the license revocation, he said.  Rwanda’s telecommunications regulator pulled Rwandatel’s
license after the third-biggest carrier in the country failed to
comply with its license obligations, the agency said April 5.  “It was very clear that the company was highly insolvent,”
said Louise Kanyonga, registrar general of the Rwanda
Development Board, said by phone after today’s hearing. The
court will make a decision April 21 on whether to appoint a
temporary administrator and oversee the liquidation of the
company’s assets, Kanyonga said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
