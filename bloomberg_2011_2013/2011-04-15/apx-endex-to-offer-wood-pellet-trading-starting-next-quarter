APX-Endex Holding BV, the
Amsterdam-based energy-exchange company, plans to offer biomass
trading starting next quarter as utilities seek alternatives to
fossil fuels to burn at power stations.  APX-Endex, whose spot power and gas volumes were worth
about 5 billion euros ($7 billion) last year, will offer wood
pellets contracts, with physical settlement to be arranged
between counterparties based on their existing trade agreements,
Chief Operating Officer Pieter Schuurs said yesterday at a
presentation in  London .  “It’s a small product compared with power and gas, but
it’s interesting enough,” he said.  Biomass is the cheapest way for the Netherlands to generate
renewable electricity, APX-Enex and its partner Port of
Rotterdam said in July when they signed a letter of intent for
the project. Governments across the world are promoting and
subsidizing renewable energy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions
from power generation.  APX-Endex began a wood-pellets index in 2008 and 15 traders
including German utilities  E.ON AG (EOAN)  and  RWE AG (RWE)  submit prices on a
weekly basis. Year-ahead delivery of wood pellets exceeded 140
euros a metric ton in February 2009 and was valued at more than
130 euros in February, according to slides at the presentation.  The traders need to agree on standardized quality and
specifications for the contracts before trading can begin and an
accord may be reached by the middle of this year, Schuurs said.  Cleared biomass trading products, in which a central
counterparty guarantees the settlement of trades, may be
introduced in the first quarter of 2012, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
