Cyprus’s parliament passed a bank
tax aimed at boosting state revenue and financing a planned
support fund that will protect investors’ deposits, lawmaker
Nicholas Papadopoulos said.  The levy of 0.095 percent on local  bank deposits  “will
create 70 million euros ($101 million) over two years in state
revenues and a further 50 million euros that will flow to a
deposits protection fund in 2013”, Papadopoulos, a member of
parliament for the center-right DHKO party and chairman of the
parliamentary finance committee, said in a telephone interview
today.  The levy will not expire in 2013 as originally planned, so
will continue to generate cash for the support fund; the  Central
Bank of Cyprus  will determine the rate of the tax, he said.  Money from the fund will be used exclusively for the
protection of depositors and not to bail out struggling banks,
while revenue from the tax in 2011 and 2012 can be used for
reducing Cyprus’s fiscal deficit and public debt, Papadopoulos
said.  The fund needs 500 million euros in capital, central bank
governor  Athanasios Orphanides  said on March 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
