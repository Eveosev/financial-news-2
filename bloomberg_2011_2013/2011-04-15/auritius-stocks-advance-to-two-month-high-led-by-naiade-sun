Mauritian stocks rallied to the
highest in almost two months, led by Sun Resorts Ltd., the
Indian Ocean island’s second-biggest leisure group operator, and
 Naiade Resorts Ltd. (NRL)   The 37-member Semdex Index climbed for a third day, adding
0.4 percent to 2,061 by 12:41 p.m. in Port Louis, the highest
intraday level since Feb. 18. Sun shares advanced the first day
in four, increasing 1.7 percent to 60 rupees, and Naiade surged
5.2 percent, the most in two months.  “Sun Resorts is driven by the positive comments that
inventory and profits will be higher in 2011, as spelt out by
its CEO in its annual report being sent to shareholders,” saud
Imrith Ramtohul, a senior investment manager who oversees a 6
billion rupee ($216 million) portfolio at Mauritius Union
Assurance, citing an advanced copy of the report. Investors are
driving up Naiade’s stock on “hopefully” better third-quarter
results, as the earnings period “coincides with the second half
of the peak tourism season,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
