Orange-juice  futures advanced,
capping a third straight weekly gain, after a jump in U.S.
exports. Cotton fell.  U.S. orange-juice shipments overseas rose to 18.87 million
gallons in February, from 10.32 million a year earlier, the
Florida Department of Citrus said yesterday in an e-mailed
report. The state is the world’s second-biggest orange producer.  “Orange juice is helped by higher exports and the
weakening of the  U.S. dollar ,” said  Michael Smith , the
president of T&K Futures and Options in Port St. Lucie, Florida.
A decline in the dollar makes commodities priced in the
greenback more attractive to buyers with other currencies.  Orange-juice futures for July delivery gained 1.2 cents, or
0.7 percent, to settle at $1.674 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The most-active contract was up 0.4
percent for the week, after climbing 2.6 percent in the previous
two weeks.  Before today, the dollar dropped 5.5 percent this year
against a basket of six major counterparts.  Brazil is the world’s biggest orange producer.  Cotton futures for July delivery fell 0.6 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $1.774 a pound on ICE. Earlier, the price touched
$1.7646, the lowest since Feb. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
