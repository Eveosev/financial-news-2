Scottish & Southern Energy Plc (SSE) , the
U.K.’s second-biggest power producer, sold three wind farms to
Infinis Plc, a renewable energy company owned by  Guy Hands , for
174 million pounds ($284 million).  Infinis bought the 30-megawatt Dalswinton park and the
36.8-megawatt Minsca plant in  Scotland  for cash, according to a
statement today from SSE. Both are producing power that’s sold
to a utility, Infinis said in a separate statement.  Infinis, which is owned by Hands’s private equity firm
Terra Firma Capital Partners Ltd., also acquired the 30-megawatt
Slieve Divena farm in  Northern Ireland  and will sell the
project’s electricity to SSE under a 14-year power purchase
agreement, according to the statement from Infinis. The
Northampton-based company declined to provide further terms.  The acquisition doubles Infinis’ wind energy capacity to
174 megawatts as it seeks to reach 230 megawatts of installed
power by 2013. The company, which had a total of 439 megawatts
of capacity in January, generated about 10 percent of the U.K.’s
renewable power in the year to March 31, 2010.  “While we are planning long-term growth of our wind energy
portfolio throughout the U.K. and Ireland, we have always said
that we will use disposals and acquisitions to optimize our wind
farm portfolio, and this sale is consistent with that,” Gregor Alexander, finance director of SSE, said in its statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
