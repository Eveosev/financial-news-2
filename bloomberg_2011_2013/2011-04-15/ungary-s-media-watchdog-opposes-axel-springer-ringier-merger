(Corrects to indicate in third paragraph that Springer,
Ringier announcement was in March 2010.)  Hungary’s media and communication
 authority  is opposed to a planned merger of the local units of
 Axel Springer AG (SPR) ,  Europe ’s biggest newspaper publisher, and
Ringier AG of Switzerland.  The fusion would “unequivocally and significantly”
threaten the right to diverse sources of information, the
authority said in a statement late yesterday.  The two companies announced in March 2010 that they would
combine their activities in  Poland , the  Czech Republic , Serbia,
Slovakia and Hungary, creating one of the region’s biggest print
and digital media companies.  The joint venture, which might be listed in three to five
years on the stock exchange, would have combined sales of 414
million euros ($598 million), the companies said last year.  Hungary’s competition authority, which will issue the final
ruling on the merger, said in e-mailed answers to questions from
Bloomberg News that it “will take into consideration” the
media authority’s opinion.  The authority has 14 working days to decide on the merger
after receipt of the media authority’s conclusions, with the
possibility of a 45-day extension, according to the e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
