The rate at which European banks
say they see each other lending in euros for three months stayed
at the highest level in almost two years, according to the
European Banking Federation.  The euro interbank offered rate, or Euribor, was unchanged
at 1.332 percent today, EBF data showed. That matches the
highest level since May 6, 2009, and snapped a run of 20
consecutive days of gains. Thatâ€™s the longest sequence of
increases since the 23-day streak ended Oct. 28, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
