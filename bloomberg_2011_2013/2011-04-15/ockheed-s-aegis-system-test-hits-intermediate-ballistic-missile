Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s Aegis-based
missile defense system hit an intermediate-range ballistic
missile for the first time today during a test off the coast of
Hawaii, the company said in a statement.  A U.S.  Navy destroyer  equipped with the Aegis Ballistic
Missile Defense system radar tracked the target, a missile with
a typical range of 1,865-3,420 miles (3,000 kilometers to 5,500
kilometers), and fired a Standard Missile to strike it down,
Bethesda, Maryland-based Lockheed said in the statement.  The U.S. Navy has deployed 21 destroyers with the Aegis
system and Standard Missiles made by Waltham, Massachusetts-
based  Raytheon Co. (RTN) , primarily designed to shoot down short- and
medium-range missiles. Newer versions of the interceptor are
designed to hit enemy missiles with longer ranges.  The Aegis system is also being adapted for sea- and ground-
based versions to be deployed to defend  Europe  from ballistic-
missile attacks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
