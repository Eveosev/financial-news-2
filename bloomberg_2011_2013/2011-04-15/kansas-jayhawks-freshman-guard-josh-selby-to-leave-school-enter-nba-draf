University of  Kansas  freshman guard
Josh Selby has left school to prepare for the 2011 National
Basketball Association draft, basketball coach Bill Self said.  Last week, Kansas forwards Marcus and Markieff Morris, the
team’s top scorers and rebounders, hired an agent and said they
would forego their senior year.  Selby, recruited by the Jayhawks as the top prospect in the
country, averaged 12 points during the Jayhawks’ first 13 games
until he injured his foot on Feb. 1 at Texas Tech. After that,
he had limited movement for the remainder of the season, Self
said.  “For him to deal with the injury was tough on him, but he
feels good now and should be 100 percent and back to the
explosive guy that he is as he works out for NBA teams,” Self
said yesterday in a statement on the team’s website.  Kansas had a 35-3 record this season. The top-seeded
Jayhawks were eliminated by Virginia Commonwealth University in
the  National Collegiate Athletic Association ’s Southwest
Regional championship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
