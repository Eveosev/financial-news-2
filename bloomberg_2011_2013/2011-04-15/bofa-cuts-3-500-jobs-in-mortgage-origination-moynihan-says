Bank of America Corp. (BAC) , the largest
U.S. lender by assets, has been cutting jobs in the mortgage-
origination business as demand falls for home loans.  “We have been reducing head count by approximately 3,500
people,” Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said today
in a conference call with analysts and investors in the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank. “About 2,000 of those are
contractors in that business and about 1,500 are teammates.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
