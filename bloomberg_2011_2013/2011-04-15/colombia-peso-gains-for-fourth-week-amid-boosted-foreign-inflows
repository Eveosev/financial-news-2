Colombia’s peso rose for a fourth
week, its longest winning streak since September, on increased
foreign investment and speculation funds from abroad will
continue to flow into the South American country.  Colombia’s peso has climbed 1 percent so far this week to
1,800.5 per  U.S. dollar  at 11:22 a.m. New York time. The
currency is up 0.2 percent today, and has advanced 5 percent in
the past month, the second-best performance after the Brazilian
real among the six major Latin American currencies.  “We’ve seen a mix of flows both from the energy sector as
well as portfolio investment,” said Andres Munoz, head currency
trader at financial services holding company Corp. Financiera
Colombiana, known as Corficolombiana. “The government has been
working to attract investment from abroad needed for
infrastructure development, and while it may take more measures
to stem gains in the peso, the strengthening trend will remain
as those flows continue coming.”  The yield on the nation’s 11 percent bonds due July 2020
rose 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.16 percent
today, according to  Colombia ’s stock exchange. The bond’s price
fell 0.060 centavo to 117.937 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
