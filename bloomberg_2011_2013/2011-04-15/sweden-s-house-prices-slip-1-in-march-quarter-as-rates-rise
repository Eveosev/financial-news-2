Swedish house prices fell in the
three months through March from the prior quarter after five
interest rate increases and a mortgage value cap helped cool the
 property market  in  Europe ’s fastest growing economy.  House prices for one- or two-dwelling buildings fell by 1
percent, Stockholm-based  Statistics Sweden  said today. Prices
rose 3 percent in the year, the office said.  The central bank has raised the benchmark repo rate five
times since July, bringing it to 1.5 percent. Governor Stefan Ingves has warned the bank may raise rates at all five remaining
meetings this year to steer Europe’s fastest economic recovery
and stem imbalances in the property market. He will announce the
bank’s next rate decision on April 20.  “We have seen during a long time that prices have damped
or stabilized,” said Roger Josefsson, chief economist at Danske
Bank A/S in Stockholm, who forecasts a repo rate of 2.75 percent
by the end of the year. “The risk is that this means that the
Riksbank can’t raise as much.”  Lending Cap  Swedish  house prices  rose during the financial crisis even
as the economy contracted and unemployment swelled, prompting
the National Housing Credit Guarantee Board in February 2010 to
warn that the country was in the grips of a property bubble.
Mortgage lending has been capped at 85 percent of the value of a
property since Oct. 1 to limit gains in house prices.  The krona gained 0.4 percent to 8.971 at 12:15 a.m. in
Stockholm. Against the dollar, it rose 0.1 percent to 6.2068.
Sweden’s two-year yield was little changed at 2.31 percent.  Property gains had been fueled by the record-low lending
rate, four income tax cuts since 2006 and a cut in real estate
taxes. The government earlier this week said it would lower
income taxes again next year and predicted falling unemployment
over the next four years as the economy speeds ahead.  The Swedish economy grew 5.5 percent in 2010, the most
since 1970, helped by a revival in exports. The government
estimated an expansion of 4.6 percent this year, 3.8 percent in
2012 and 3.6 percent in 2013, according to its spring fiscal
budget bill released this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
