OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA, the  oil company  controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista ,
reported 10.8 billion barrels of total crude and natural-gas
resources, the second-most for a Brazilian-based company.  Prospective resources fell 3 percent to 6.5 billion barrels
from a 2009 estimate by auditing firm DeGolyer & MacNaughton,
while contingent resources rose more than 14-fold to 3 billion,
OGX said today in a statement distributed in Rio de Janeiro. OGX
also reported 1.3 billion of so-called delineation resources.  OGX has had a success rate of more than 90 percent at its
wells since it began exploring for oil and gas in Brazil,
Production Manager Jose Brito de Oliveira said on April 13. The
Rio de Janeiro-based company, which has no output or proven oil
reserves, plans to start production in the third quarter from
the offshore Campos Basin.  “We had a lot of success with our exploration campaign,”
OGX Chief Executive Officer Paulo Mendonca said today at a press
conference in Rio.  Mendonca previously said he expected a “significant” rise
in the company’s potential oil and natural-gas resources after
making a new discovery in  Brazil . Contingent resources rose
after the company drilled additional exploration wells since
2009 on land and off the coast of Brazil.  Gas Resources  The company also said it has an estimated 56 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas reserves in Brazil’s Parnaiba basin that
aren’t included in the DeGolyer & MacNaughton estimate. That’s
up from a 2009 forecast of 15 trillion cubic feet.  In the 2009 study, OGX reported 6.7 billion barrels of
prospective and 212 million barrels of contingent resources.  Shares rose 60 centavos, or 3.2 percent, to 19.65 reais at

in the past 12 months, compared with a 5.5 percent rise for
Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Brazil’s state-controlled oil
producer, owns the nation’s largest reserves and is the biggest
crude producer in Brazil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
