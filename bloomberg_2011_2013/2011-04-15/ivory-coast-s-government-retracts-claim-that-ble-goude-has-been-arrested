Ivory Coast ’s government retracted
earlier statements and said it couldn’t confirm the arrest of
Charles Ble Goude, leader of a youth militia and an ally of
former President Laurent Gbagbo.  “We did not have all the information on the case of Ble
Goude,” Patrick Achi, a spokesman for the government of
 Alassane Ouattara , said by phone today. “It is not known where
he is now. We cannot confirm his arrest.”  Ble Goude served as Gbagbo’s youth minister and ran militia
recruitment drives on behalf of the former president, who was
apprehended on April 11 by fighters loyal to Ouattara. Gbagbo
had refused to hand power to Ouattara, the internationally
recognized winner of a disputed Nov. 28 presidential election.
The government earlier said Ble Goude was under house arrests in
an e-mailed response to questions.  The  United Nations  placed Ble Goude under sanctions in 2006
for advocating violence against the organization. In the past
four months, Ble Goude has made statements “that have appeared
to lead directly to lethal attacks against many real and
perceived Ouattara supporters,” Corinne Dufka, West Africa
analyst for  Human Rights Watch , said by phone today.  Ivory Coast’s Ministry of Defense called for the disbanding
of militias and asked citizens to hand in weapons to the
country’s security forces “without fear or risk of reprisals”
in a statement e-mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
