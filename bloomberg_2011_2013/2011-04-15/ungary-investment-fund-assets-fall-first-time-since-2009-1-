Hungarian investment-fund assets
fell last month for the first time in almost two years and the
decline may gain momentum as the government takes over privately
managed pensions, the association of fund managers said.  The 469 funds represented by the association known as
 Bamosz  had a combined value of 3.82 trillion forint ($20.7
billion) at the end of March, 1.7 percent less than in February,
the Budapest-based group said in an e-mailed statement today. It
was the first decline since June 2009, the association said.  Funds had negative returns in March because of the
earthquake in  Japan  and “risks associated with the euro,”
Andras Temmel, general secretary of Bamosz, wrote in the
statement, without specifying the euro risks. “Substantial”
withdrawals by institutional investors because of the pension
changes contributed to the decrease, Temmel wrote.  “We are expecting the slump to accelerate,” Temmel said
in a telephone interview. “The more drastic fall will happen
after the transfer of pension assets.”  Private pension funds have until June 12 to transfer
savings to a special government fund. Bamosz members oversee 9.4
trillion forint in assets, of which 3 trillion forint is pension
funds. The pension funds will lose about 90 percent of their
assets, Temmel said.  Bamosz’s members include units of Munich-based Allianz SE,
 Europe ’s biggest insurer, Vienna-based Erste Group Bank AG,
eastern Europe’s second-biggest lender, and OTP Bank Nyrt.,
 Hungary ’s largest bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
