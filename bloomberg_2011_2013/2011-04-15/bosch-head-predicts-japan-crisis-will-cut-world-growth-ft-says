Global economic growth will be a
quarter of a percentage point less this year as a result of last
month’s earthquake, tsunami and nuclear emergency in Japan,
according to Franz Fehrenbach, the chief executive officer of
 Robert Bosch GmbH , the Financial Times reported.  None the less, global growth will still reach 3.5 percent,
the newspaper cited Fehrenbach as saying.  This forecast by the chief of the world’s biggest car parts
supplier is more exact than any that have emanated so far from
big economic institutions on the impact of the Japanese
calamity, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
