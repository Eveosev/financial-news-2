Shanto Ghosh, an economist at
Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu  India  Pvt. comments on inflation in
India. The wholesale-price index rose 8.98 percent from a year
earlier after an 8.31 percent gain in February, the government
said today. The median forecast of 28 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey was for an 8.36 percent increase.  “We are going to see a gradual declining trend in food
articles and manufactured goods. In the latest inflation number
there has been a modest impact of oil prices.  “However, inflation can’t be moderated unless oil comes
down to $90 a barrel. The rise in oil prices may negate any
positives that are coming from the other components of inflation.  “The concern with regards to overall inflation in the
coming months has increased from what they were some months ago
and that is because of the oil price and production situation.  “I believe the  Reserve Bank  of India will continue its
stance of monetary contraction. I expect  interest rates  to rise
by another 75 basis points over the next one year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
