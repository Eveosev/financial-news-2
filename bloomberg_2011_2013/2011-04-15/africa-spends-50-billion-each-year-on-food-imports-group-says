Africa  pays $50 billion each year
on food imports and will need to invest $39 billion annually for
the next 15 years in order to become self-sufficient, said
Akinwumi Adesina, vice president of the Alliance for a Green
Revolution in Africa.  The continent faces problems with a “lack of storage
facilities, infrastructure and marketing of agricultural
produce,” he said in Accra, the Ghanaian capital, today.  If Africa doubles its agricultural output by 2015, the
continent’s annual gross domestic product would increase by 5.5
percent, Adesina said. African governments need to develop
strategies to get banks to boost lending to the industry, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
