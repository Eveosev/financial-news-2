ConocoPhillips (COP)  will shut a coker at
its Rodeo refinery in  California  during turnaround work that is
slated to begin in mid-May, according to a person with knowledge
of the plans.  The work is scheduled to be completed by mid-June, said the
person, who declined to be identified because the information is
confidential.  Rich Johnson , a spokesman for ConocoPhillips, declined to
comment.  The Rodeo refinery is one of two plants in the region
operated by ConocoPhillips. Rodeo is linked by a 200-mile
pipeline to the company’s Santa Maria plant, which is to the
south in Arroyo Grande.  The Rodeo refinery processes mostly heavy, high-sulfur
crude oil from California, according to the company’s 2009 Fact
Book. The  Santa Maria  plant sends some semi-refined products to
Rodeo to upgrade into finished products.  Cokers use heat and pressure to process heavier crudes into
lighter products such as naphtha, middle distillates and coke,
which can be used as a fuel.  The refinery can process 128,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
