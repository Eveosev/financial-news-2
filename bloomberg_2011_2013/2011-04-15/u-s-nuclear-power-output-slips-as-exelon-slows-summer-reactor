U.S. nuclear-power output slipped
for a second day as  Scana Corp. (SCG)  slowed the Summer reactor in
 South Carolina , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide fell 115 megawatts, or 0.2
percent, from yesterday to 76,155 megawatts, or 75 percent of
capacity, according to an NRC report today and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Twenty-four of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were
offline.  Scana slowed the 966-megawatt Virgil C. Summer reactor to
40 percent of capacity from 80 percent yesterday. The plant is
located near Jenkinsville, about 26 miles (42 kilometers)
northwest of Columbia.  The Tennessee Valley Authority boosted output from the
1,104-megawatt Browns Ferry 2 reactor in Alabama to 92 percent
of capacity from 65 percent yesterday.  Browns Ferry Units 1 and 3, which have respective
capacities of 1,065 megawatts and 1,115 megawatts, are operating
at full power. The plant is located 84 miles north of Birmingham
on Wheeler Lake, near the Tennessee border.  Progress Energy Inc. (PGN)  increased output from the 937-megawatt
Brunswick 2 reactor in  North Carolina  to 7 percent of capacity
from 1 percent yesterday. The Brunswick 1 unit is operating at
full power. The plant is located at Cape Fear on the Atlantic
Ocean, 130 miles south of Raleigh.  Illinois Reactor  Exelon Corp. (EXC)  slowed the 1,152-megawatt Braidwood 2 reactor
in Illinois to 91 percent of capacity from 97 percent yesterday.
Another reactor on the site, 1,178-megawatt Braidwood 1 unit,
was operating at full power. The plant is located about 54 miles
southwest of Chicago.  Some reactors close for maintenance and refueling during
the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating and
cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
