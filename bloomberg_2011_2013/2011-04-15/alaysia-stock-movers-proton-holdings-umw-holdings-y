Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Malaysia trading. Stock symbols are in

Lumpur.  The  FTSE Bursa Malaysia KLCI (FBMKLCI)  Index fell 4.85, or 0.3
percent, to 1,520.95, set for its lowest close since March 29.
The gauge has fallen 2.4 percent this week, headed for its
biggest weekly drop since Feb. 11.        DiGi.Com Bhd. (DIGI)  , a mobile-phone operator, declined
1.2 percent to 29.14 ringgit, set for its largest drop since
March 10, after the stock was cut to “hold” from “buy” at
UOB-Kay Hian Holdings Ltd. There are “limited catalysts” for
the stock in the near term, Vincent Khoo, an analyst at UOB-Kay
Hian, wrote in a report today.        Proton Holdings Bhd. (PROH)  , a carmaker, gained 2.2
percent to 3.32 ringgit, bound for its biggest increase since
March 29. Group Lotus Plc, the British sports car arm of Proton,
should be able to break even in 2014, Dany Bahar, the unit’s
chief executive officer, told reporters today. Group Lotus’s
Lotus Cars Ltd. signed a syndicated financing deal for 270
million pounds ($441.1 million) with six lenders, according to a
company statement.  UMW Holdings Bhd. (UMWH)  , an automaker, fell 0.7 percent
to 7.24 ringgit, headed for the lowest close since March 24,
after OSK Research Sdn. said UMW, previously its top pick among
Malaysian auto shares, is now its “top sell.” UMW was cut to
“sell” from “buy” and its “fair value” reduced to 6.41
ringgit from 8.92 ringgit, OSK analysts led by Chris Eng wrote
in a report today.       YTL Corp. (YTL MK), a construction and utilities group,
advanced 2.8 percent to 7.67 ringgit, on course for its steepest
increase since Nov. 24, after saying it has a cash pile of 12
billion ringgit ($4 billion) which it may use for acquisitions.  To contact the reporters on this story:
