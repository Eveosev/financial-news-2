State workers in  Botswana  will
start a 10-day strike on April 18 in support of demands for
increased pay, the Botswana Federation of Public Sector Unions
said.  Trade unions are demanding an increase of 16 percent,
against a conditional offer of 5 percent given by the
government.  “The negotiations broke down and the parties declared a
deadlock,” Andrew Motsamai, secretary general of the government
workers federation, told a meeting in the capital, Gaborone,
late yesterday.  The government can’t afford to pay an increase of 16
percent, Festina Bakwena, director of the Department of Public
Service Management, said in an e-mailed statement. Even the 5
percent offer is conditional on a second-quarter assessment of
the economy showing a significant improvement, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
