Executives at  Alstom SA (ALO) ’s U.K. unit
said investigators didn’t have enough evidence to search their
homes as part of a probe into claims the company paid 81 million
pounds ($132 million) in bribes.  A lawyer for Stephen Burgin, president of the French
transport company’s unit, and Robert Purcell, its finance
director, told a  London  court today they should be allowed to
argue the U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office didn’t have enough reason
to suspect them.  “There is absolutely no evidence of these men being
involved in any substantial payments,” said  Clare Montgomery ,
their lawyer. The men joined Alstom in 2008 and 2009 “well
after” the allegations took place.  Burgin and Purcell won a partial ruling last year allowing
them to argue police didn’t have good reason to arrest them as
part of a bribery,  money laundering  and false accounting probe.
They are seeking court approval to also challenge the SFO’s role
in the case. Prosecutors suspect that from 2004 to 2010 Alstom,
through its Alstom Network U.K. Ltd. unit, gave money to
companies that acted as “bogus consultants” to bribe overseas
officials for contracts, according to court papers.  A lawyer for the SFO,  James Eadie , said Alstom Network
acted as “a conduit” to pass money through and that the
payments were “ongoing.”  The unit was paying “nine times as much commission in the
Middle East and Africa compared to  Europe , and eight times for
Asia,” Eadie said. “That’s as good of an inference as one
could muster.”  Alstom has denied the allegations. No further hearings in
the matter were scheduled.  The cases are: Burgin v. Commissioner of Police of the
Metropolis, case no. 10/6227; and Burgin v. Director of the
 Serious Fraud Office , case no. 10/5723, High Court of Justice,
Administrative Court (London).  To contact the reporter for this story:
