(Corrects export sales volume in eighth paragraph.)  Wheat futures gained, narrowing a
weekly loss, as dry weather persisted through growing areas in
parts of  Europe , increasing crop stress, while parts of
Australia may get below-normal rain.  Wheat for July delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent to
$7.835 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, before trading at
$7.78 a bushel by 12:15 p.m. Singapore time. The contract is set
for a 6.5 percent loss this week, the first in five.  England , northern  France , Benelux and  Germany  may have
“mostly dry weather” through next week or longer, increasing
stress to the winter-wheat crop, Telvent DTN Inc. said in an
April 14 forecast. Rainfall in  Western Australia  in the next
three months may be less than normal, the state’s Department of
Agriculture & Food said earlier this week.  “Concerns are emerging over dry weather in Europe and
 Australia ’s wheat-producing areas,”  Barclays Capital  said in an
e-mailed report.  France’s crops office, FranceAgriMer, increased its
estimate on April 13 for the nation’s soft-wheat exports outside
the EU in the 12 months to June to 12.75 million tons from 12.6
million tons. Total wheat exports were also raised to 19.36
million tons, from 19.26 million tons. France is the biggest
wheat exporter after the U.S.  Demand is being bolstered by sales to the Middle East and
North Africa, where governments are seeking to increase
stockpiles to damp prices that contributed to violent protests
that already toppled leaders in Egypt and Tunisia.  July-delivery corn slipped 0.2 percent to $7.5975 a bushel
in  Chicago , swinging from a 0.5 percent gain earlier. The
contract is set for a 1.8 percent loss this week, the first in
five weeks.  Exporters in the U.S. sold 1.1 million tons of corn in the
week to April 7, from 808,904 tons a week earlier, the
Department of Agriculture said in a report yesterday. Rain,
thunderstorms and snow in the Midwest may persist in the 10 days
from yesterday, slowing early planting and field work,  “Fundamentals remain very constructive in the corn market,
with U.S. inventories drawn to extremely low levels,” Barclays
analysts said. “A wet spring planting season are unlikely to
ally supply concerns.”  Soybeans for July delivery gained 0.2 percent, to $13.4575
a bushel in Chicago, set for a 4.1 percent loss this week.  Farmers in  Argentina , the world’s third-largest grower and
exporter of soybeans, are selling the oilseed at a fifth of the
average pace, as they wait for prices to rise.  The volume of Argentine soybeans sold at the Rosario
Cereals Exchange fell to about 5,000 to 10,000 tons, compared
with the normal volume of 40,000 or 50,000 tons at this time of
the year, Lorena D’Angelo, an analyst at the exchange, said
yesterday from Rosario.  To contact the reporter on this story:
