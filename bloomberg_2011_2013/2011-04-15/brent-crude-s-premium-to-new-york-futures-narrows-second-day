North Sea Brent crude’s premium to
U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate oil narrowed for a second
day.  The spread between the two front-month contracts was at
$13.55 a barrel as of 9:15 a.m.  London  time, compared with
$14.25 at settlement yesterday, according to Bloomberg data.  “The intermarket Brent/WTI spread crossed the minus $16.00
a barrel barrier yesterday with a low print of minus $16.39, but
as we saw between February and March, heavy support stepped in
at this level,”  Stephen Schork , president of the Schork Group
Inc., a consultant in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  “The physical costs of shipping crude from Cushing to
western Europe should stop the spread from getting too wide,”
he said today in a report, referring to the potential to ship
arbitrage cargoes from the U.S.  Brent for June delivery traded at $122.13 a barrel on
London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. WTI futures for June were
at $108.58 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
