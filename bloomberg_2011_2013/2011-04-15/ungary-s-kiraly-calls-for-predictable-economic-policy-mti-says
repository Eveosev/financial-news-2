Hungary  needs predictable economic
policies to boost lending and jump-start growth, central bank
Vice President Julia Kiraly said, according to state-run news
service  MTI .  Hungary should lower the special tax on financial
institutions, scrap a moratorium on home foreclosures, set up
new rules for foreign-currency lending and revamp home-rental
legislation to improve economic stability and the country’s risk
assessment, Kiraly said at a conference in Debrecen, eastern
Hungary, MTI reported.  The tax burden on banks is "disproportionately" high and as
a result Hungary’s banking industry "has the worst profitability
in central and eastern  Europe  and is unable to contribute to
economic recovery," Kiraly said, according to MTI.  To contact the reporters on this story:
