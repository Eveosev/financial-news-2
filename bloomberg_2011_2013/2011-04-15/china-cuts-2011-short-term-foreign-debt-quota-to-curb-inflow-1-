China’s  State Administration of
Foreign Exchange  cut its outstanding short-term foreign debt
quota for the year to help curb inflows of so-called hot money.  The reduction will “help maintain balance in international
payments and boost liquidity management,” SAFE said in a
statement on its website today.  The quota for some Chinese banks will be reduced to
$10.2 billion for the year starting from April 1, the currency
regulator said. It set the quota for some foreign banks at $14.6
billion, according to the statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
