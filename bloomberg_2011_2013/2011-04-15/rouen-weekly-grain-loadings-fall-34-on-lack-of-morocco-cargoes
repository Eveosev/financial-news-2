Grain loaded for export from the
French port of Rouen,  Europe ’s biggest cereal-shipping hub, fell
34 percent in the week through April 13 as no wheat was shipped
to  Morocco  in the period.  Outgoing grain shipments were 114,643 metric tons between
April 7 and 13, the Seine River port said in an e-mailed
statement yesterday. Loadings dropped from 173,930 tons the
previous week.  Algeria was the biggest export destination with 86,543 tons
of wheat in the most recent week. The country bought 2.95
million tons from Dec. 16 to Jan. 26, probably the most-ever in
a five-week period, French crops office FranceAgriMer said in
February.  France ’s other main grain ports are La Pallice in the Bay
of Biscay and Dunkirk on the North Sea coast.  Rouen grain loadings by destination, in tons:  To contact the reporter on this story:
