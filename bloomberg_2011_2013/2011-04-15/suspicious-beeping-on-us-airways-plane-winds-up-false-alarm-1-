Police at New Yorkâ€™s LaGuardia
Airport found nothing suspicious after passengers on a Boston-
bound  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  shuttle plane reported hearing a
beeping noise.  The noise was determined to have originated from a credit
card swipe machine with low battery power, said Justine Karp, a
 Port Authority  of New York and New Jersey spokeswoman.  The Embraer 190 aircraft was originally scheduled to depart
LaGuardia at 6 p.m. local time and arrive at 7:15 p.m.,
according to US Airways spokesman Andrew Christie. The plane had
pushed back from the gate before the noise was reported and 99
passengers and 4 crew members were escorted off, he said.  The plane is set to arrive in Boston at 9:40 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
