European stocks and U.S. index
futures were little changed as better-than-forecast results at
companies from Nestle SA to Syngenta AG offset a report that
 China ’s inflation accelerated to the fastest pace since 2008.
Asian shares retreated.  Nestle rose 1 percent after the world’s largest food
company reported first-quarter organic sales growth that topped
the average analyst estimate. Syngenta gained 0.7 percent after
the world’s biggest maker of agricultural chemicals posted
first-quarter sales at the top end of a range of analysts’
projections as higher grain prices spurred farmers to invest.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index rose 0.1 percent to
277.27 at 8:03 a.m. in  London . The measure has retreated 1.6
percent this week as  Japan  said its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant may release more radiation than Chernobyl
and Alcoa Inc. began the U.S. earnings season with sales that
missed analysts’ estimates. Google Inc. dropped in extended
trading last night after reporting profit excluding some items
that fell short of the average analyst estimate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
