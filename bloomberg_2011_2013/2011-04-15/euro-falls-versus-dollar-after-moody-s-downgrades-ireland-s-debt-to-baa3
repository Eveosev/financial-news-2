The euro weakened against the
dollar after Moody’s Investors Service lowered Ireland’s debt
rating and indicated more downgrades may follow.  The shared currency weakened as much as 0.3 percent to
$1.4451 and traded at $1.4452 as of 7:08 a.m. in  London .  Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s foreign- and local-currency
government bond ratings by two notches to Baa3 from Baa1. The
outlook on the ratings remains negative.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
