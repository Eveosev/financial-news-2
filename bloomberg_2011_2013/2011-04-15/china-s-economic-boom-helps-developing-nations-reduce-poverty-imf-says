The economic boom in  China  and
India will help more than two-thirds of developing countries
meet a 2015 goal of reducing poverty and hunger, the  World Bank 
and  International Monetary Fund  said in a report.  The number of people in extreme poverty, defined as living
on less than $1.25 a day, is forecast to drop to 883 million in
four years from 1.4 billion in 2005 and 1.8 billion in 1990, the
Washington-based lenders said in their Global Monitoring Report
released today.  Much of this progress stems from economic growth in China
and India, while Africa, the world’s poorest continent, has seen
fewer improvements, the report said. In China, 4.8 percent of
people are projected to live on less than $1.25 a day in 2015,
compared with 36 percent, or 345 million, in sub-Saharan Africa,
the report said.  “The fight against poverty is progressing well,” the
report said. “Based on current economic projections, the world
remains on track to reduce by half the number of people living
in extreme poverty.”  World leaders at the  United Nations  pledged in 2000 to meet
targets to reduce extreme poverty and hunger, provide universal
primary schooling, improve gender parity in education, lower
child mortality rates and combat HIV and AIDS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
