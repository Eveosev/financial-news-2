The following companies had unusual
price changes in Sao Paulo trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m.  New York  time. Preferred
shares are usually the most-traded class of stock.  The Bovespa Index rose 0.6 percent to 66,684.21.  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , (PETR4 BS)  Brazil ’s national oil
company, rose 2.1 percent to 26.53 reais after a report showed
U.S. industrial output increased more than economists forecast
in March, signaling higher fuel demand in the world’s biggest
crude-consuming country. Output rose 0.8 percent, the fifth
straight gain, after a revised 0.1 percent rise in February, the
 Federal Reserve  said today in  Washington . Economists surveyed by
Bloomberg projected a 0.6 percent gain.  Lojas Renner SA (LREN3 BS), Brazil’s biggest publicly
traded clothing retailer, increased 3.4 percent to 57.20 reais
after a report showed consumer prices rose less than forecast
this month, a positive sign for companies that depend on
domestic demand. The Rio de Janeiro-based Getulio Vargas
Foundation’s IGP-10 inflation index was 0.56 percent for the
month ending April 10, less than the 0.6 percent median estimate
in a Bloomberg survey of 29 economists.  Vale SA (VALE3)  (VALE5), the world’s second-largest mining company,
fell 0.4 percent to 45.65 reais as copper fell for a fifth day
in New York after production in  China , the largest consumer,
climbed to a record amid concern that demand will slow as the
government tightens credit to curb inflation. Copper futures for
July delivery fell 0.6 percent on the Comex, capping a 5 percent
drop for the most-active contract this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
