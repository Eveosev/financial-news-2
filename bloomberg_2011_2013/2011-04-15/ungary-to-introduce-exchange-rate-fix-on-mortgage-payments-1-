The Hungarian government is
planning to introduce an exchange rate fix for foreign-currency
mortgage repayments to lower the currency risk of debtors, the
country’s updated euro convergence plan shows.  The exchange rate on these loans will be “fixed at a level
somewhat more favorable than now,” according to the  plan  posted
on the website of the economy ministry today.  The difference resulting from the fixed and actual exchange
rate will be entered on a separate account where the debt will
accumulate or disappear if better exchange rates emerge, the
plan said. For the negative balance, the government will
undertake a full guarantee for the period of the fixed-exchange
rate and 25 percent fallback guarantee for the rest of the term.  Banks will be required to offer temporary housing aid to
defaulted debtors who sell their properties and will have to
forgive the part of debt above the value of the property to
secure the loan, according to the plan. The government will
offer interest rate subsidies to investors planning to purchase
the property that secures a loan so foreclosed, the plan said.  The Cabinet will set up a National Asset Management Company
to acquire the property of the families most in need through
debtor or creditor agreements or in auction, and then to rent to
the debtor.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
