South Korea , the world’s second-
largest buyer of liquefied natural gas, increased imports of the
fuel in March to build stockpiles and meet increased demand
because of colder-than-average weather.  The nation bought 3.77 million metric tons of the cleaner-
burning fuel last month from 3.44 million tons a year earlier,
according to data posted on the Korea Customs Service’s  website 
today. The country paid $2.14 billion, or $565.64 a ton,
compared with $1.75 billion, or $509.04 a ton, a year earlier,
the data show.  South Korea purchased 511,301 tons in the spot market for
$542.48 a ton from countries including  Trinidad & Tobago , Peru
and Nigeria, according to the data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
