The  European Central Bank  will
unveil plans next week for a database of underlying loans that
back deals in the asset-backed securities market in an effort to
boost demand, Reuters reported.  ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet  will publish a letter
inviting potential market participants on April 22, according to
the report, which cited people in the industry who weren’t
identified. Residential mortgage-backed securities will be the
first asset class to come under the ECB’s loan-by-loan data
requirements, with other groups to follow, Reuters said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
