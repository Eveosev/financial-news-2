Guinea  will spend $202 million to
improve provision of drinking water, Energy and Hydraulics
Minister Papa Koly Kourouma said in a statement broadcast on
state radio today.  The West African nation needs 280,000 cubic meters (74
million gallons) of water each day, Kourouma said. The current
production is 159,000 cubic meters, 91 percent of which is used
in Conakry, the capital, he said.  Guinea will seek funders for the project, Kourouma said,
without elaborating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
