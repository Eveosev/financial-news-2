U.S. coal demand was little changed
in the week ended yesterday from the previous seven-day period,
according to  Genscape Inc.   Western power-plant use and consumption in the East were
also little changed, the data provider said. Overall coal demand
was steady compared with a year earlier.  Genscape says it monitors coal use in real time at U.S.
power producers with a device that’s installed at the plants.
The company uses different models to reach its consumption
figures, making it possible for regional data to conflict with
national totals.  The U.S., which holds the world’s largest reserves of coal,
relies on the fuel for about 47 percent of its power generation,
compared with about 23 percent for natural gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
