Turkey is considering ending its
financial support for the state theater, Hurriyet newspaper
reported, citing Culture Minister Ertugrul Gunay.  It’s possible that money for the Ankara-based state theater
would be better spent by supporting non-government theaters and
companies, Gunay said, according to the newspaper.  His comments follow an incident in which Prime Minister
 Recep Tayyip Erdogan ’s daughter Sumeyye walked out of a state
theater performance of the play "Young Osman" in Ankara,
Hurriyet said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
