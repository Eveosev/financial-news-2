At least 220 people were arrested
and detained in  Uganda  yesterday as they defied a police ban
against a “walk-to-work” protest against rising fuel and food
prices, the Daily Monitor reported, without saying where it got
the information.  The suspects are being held for inciting violence,
disobeying lawful orders, blocking traffic flow and holding
illegal assemblies, the Kampala-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
