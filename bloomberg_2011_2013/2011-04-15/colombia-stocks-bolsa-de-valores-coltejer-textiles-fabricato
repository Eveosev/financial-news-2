The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 4 p.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index rose 0.2 percent to 14,102.75, while the
Colcap Index was little changed at 1,670.18.  Bolsa de Valores de Colombia (BVC)  SA, the operator of
the country’s main securities exchange, rose 0.5 percent to 39.7
pesos. The company’s first-quarter earnings exceeded analysts’
forecasts for a sixth straight quarter, according to a report e-
mailed by brokerage Bolsa y Renta.  Textiles makers fell as  Colombia ’s peso rose for a fourth
week, its longest winning streak since September, reducing
revenue for exporters, said Felipe Sanchez, an analyst at
brokerage Serfinco SA.  Coltejer SA (COLTEJ)  , the Medellin-based clothing maker
and exporter, dropped 1.2 percent to 86 centavos.  Textiles Fabricato Tejicondor SA (FABRI)  , Colombia’s
biggest textile maker, fell 1.1 percent to 43.5 pesos.  Cementos Argos SA (CEMARGOS)   declined 1.1 percent to a
one-month low of 10,380 pesos, as investors speculated that
heavy rains could slow construction projects, said  Andres Jimenez , an analyst at Interbolsa SA. The state-run Institute of
Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental Studies warned rain
triggered by the La Nina weather pattern will swell rivers and
increase the risk of mudslides, according to a statement on its
website yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
