Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  said all units
continue to operate after a breakdown caused emissions at its
Torrance, California, refinery.  “Flaring was caused by a temporary mechanical issue in one
of our units,” Aarti Ramachandran, a spokeswoman for the
refinery, said in a telephone interview. “There’s no impact to
production.”  The plant can process 155,800 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
