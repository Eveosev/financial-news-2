South Africa ’s central bank
allocated none of its six-year inflation-linked bonds at a
weekly auction, indicating investors aren’t concerned about
price increases in  Africa ’s biggest economy.  The Pretoria-based central bank received only two bids for
the 2.5 percent securities maturing in 2017, and didn’t accept
them. The breakeven rate, or yield difference between the bonds
and standard notes of similar maturity, is 6.1 percent.
Inflation-linked bonds return less than standard notes if
average inflation is lower than the breakeven rate.  South Africa’s inflation rate was unchanged at 3.7 percent
in February. The auction took place one day after the central
bank said inflation is “well-contained”. Rising oil prices
probably won’t push inflation higher than the  Reserve Bank ’s 3
percent to 6 percent target range, Gerhard van den Heever, the
central bank’s deputy chief economist, told lawmakers in Cape
Town. The bank said on March 24 it expects the inflation rate to
average 4.7 percent in 2011 and 5.7 percent in 2012.  “The inflation-linked bond auction today will be
especially significant in that it will give us insight into
whether inflation expectations have moderated any further,”
Tradition Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based
Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note before the auction.  The central bank sold 450 million rand ($65.5 million) of
2.75 percent inflation-linked bonds due 2022 at a clearing yield
of 2.71 percent, and 150 million rand of 3.45 percent securities
due 2033, also at a yield of 2.71 percent. The breakeven rate
between the 2022 inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate notes of
similar maturity is 5.82 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
