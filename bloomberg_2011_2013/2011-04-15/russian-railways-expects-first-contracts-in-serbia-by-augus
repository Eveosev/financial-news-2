OAO Russian Railways said it
expects to sign its first contracts in  Serbia  in August as part
of an $800 million loan program for Serbian rail infrastructure.  The Russian company will deliver equipment worth more than
half of the credit amount that the Russian government pledged
for upgrading about 300 kilometers (180 miles) of tracks and
junctions in the Balkan country, Serbian Infrastructure Minister
Milutin Mrkonjic said today after meeting in Belgrade with
Russian Railway’s Chief Executive Officer Vladimir Yakunin.  “The Russian side will also provide financial support of
6 to 7 million euros for the completion of project designs”
required before the government can start disbursing the
financing, which will come in stages, Yakunin said after signing
a protocol with Mrkonjic.  The $800 million loan is part of a broader deal agreed
between Serbian President  Boris Tadic  and his Russian
counterpart  Dmitry Medvedev  in 2009. Serbia borrowed $200
million from  Russia  last year to bolster its budget and expects
further support from its ally.  Financial details of the infrastructure loan, including the
interest rate, have yet to be negotiated, Mrkonjic said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
