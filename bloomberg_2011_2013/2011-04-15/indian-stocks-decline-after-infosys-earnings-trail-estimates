India ’s stocks dropped the most in
a month as inflation quickened, increasing pressure for higher
 interest rates , and as earnings of  Infosys Technologies Ltd. (INFO) 
missed analyst estimates.  Infosys, the second-largest software exporter, dropped the
most since May 2009 after posting group profit of 18.2 billion
rupees ($409 million) in the quarter ended March, less than the
18.9 billion rupee average of 27 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg News. The wholesale-price index rose 8.98 percent in
March from a year earlier after an 8.31 percent advance in
February, the government said. That’s faster than the 8.36
percent median forecast of 28 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Inflation is a big concern and it may increase further as
the government is likely to hike fuel prices after elections in
states end next month,” said R.K. Gupta, managing director of
Taurus Asset Management Ltd. in  New Delhi . “Infosys has guided
for a margin decline this year due to sluggish growth. We will
wait for guidance from other software exporters to see if it’s
an industry-wide phenomenon.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
335.86, or 1.7 percent, to 19,361, according to preliminary
closing prices at the 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai, the biggest decline
since Feb. 24. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock
Exchange dropped 1.6 percent to 5,814.70, and its April futures
settled at 5,825. The BSE 200 Index declined 1.4 percent to
2,393.89.  To contact the reporter on this story:
