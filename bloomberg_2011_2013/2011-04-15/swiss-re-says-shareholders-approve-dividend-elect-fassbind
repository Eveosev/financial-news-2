Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s
second-biggest reinsurer, said shareholders approved its 2010
dividend and elected former Credit Suisse Group AG Chief
Financial Officer Renato Fassbind onto its board.  “This supports us in pursuing our strategy to become the
leading player in the wholesale insurance and reinsurance
industry,” Chairman Walter Kielholz said today in a statement
following the company’s annual general meeting today in Zurich.  The Zurich-based reinsurer almost tripled its dividend to
2.75 Swiss francs ($3.08) a share from 1 franc in 2009, after
repaying a 3 billion-franc capital injection by Warren Buffett’s
Berkshire Hathaway Inc.  Chief Executive Officer Stefan Lippe is taking Swiss Re
“back to basics” after his predecessor Jacques Aigrain’s
strategy of trading securities such as credit default swaps led
to record losses. Swiss Re is trying to regain its AA-  credit
rating , which  Standard & Poor’s  cut in 2009.  Shareholders also approved changes to the reinsurer’s
conditional capital, Swiss Re said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
