EBS Building Society, bailed out by
the Irish taxpayer, posted a record loss for 2010 as it prepares
for a government-ordered merger with  Allied Irish Banks Plc. (ALBK)   The net loss widened to 589.6 million euros ($852 million)
from 78.8 million euros a year earlier as loan impairments
soared after the country’s real estate bubble burst, the Dublin-
based lender said in a statement today.  The government, which seized control of EBS last year, in
March scrapped plans to sell the building society to a group
including U.S. billionaire  Wilbur Ross ’s leveraged-buyout firm
WL Ross & Co. and Dublin-based Cardinal Capital Group. The
following day, Finance Minister  Michael Noonan  directed EBS to
merge with Allied Irish as Ireland published the results of a
third round of stress tests on the country’s banks.  “2010 will be remembered as a year of huge economic change
in Ireland,” Philip Williamson, EBS chairman, said in today’s
statement. “During 2011, our focus will be on the successful
formation of a ‘pillar’ bank through the combination of Allied
Irish with EBS.”  Total impairment losses on loans and assets, including a
loss on loans transferred to the National Asset Management
Agency, the country’s so-called bad bank, totalled 677 million
euros, up from 78.8 million euros the previous year.  EBS, which received an 875 million-euro state bailout last
year, was ordered by the central bank to raise a further  1.5
billion euros  of capital following the stress tests.  Allied Irish Chairman David Hodgkinson said on April 12 he
expects the EBS brand to remain.  To contact the reporters on this story:
