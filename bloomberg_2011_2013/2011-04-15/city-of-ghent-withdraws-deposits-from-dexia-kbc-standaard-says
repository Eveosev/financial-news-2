The Belgian city of Ghent will
withdraw 30 million euros to 35 million euros in deposits and
short-term investments from Dexia Bank Belgium SA and KBC Bank
NV, De Standaard reported, citing the city council.  Ghent may also transfer its long-term investments and the
payment of city workers’ wages to other banks to protest bonus
awards for top executives at the bailed-out lenders, the
newspaper said, citing Christophe Peeters, who’s in charge of
the city council’s finances.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
