Colombia, the second-largest
producer of arabica beans after  Brazil , forecast above-average
rainfall next month for coffee growers in the Andes mountains.  Precipitation triggered by the La Nina weather pattern will
swell rivers and increase the risk of mudslides in areas
including the province of Antioquia, the nation’s largest
coffee-growing region, according to a  report  yesterday by the
state-run Institute of Hydrology, Meteorology and Environmental
Studies in Bogota.  Adverse weather in Colombia has helped double arabica
coffee in  New York  in the past 12 months. The effect of La Nina
has cut production in  Indonesia  and may hurt harvests in parts
of  Africa , the  International Coffee Organization  said April 6.  Rainstorms last year that knocked flowers from coffee
plants in Antioquia will cut output in the first six months of
the year, Jose Sierra, a committee member representing the
region’s farmers at  Colombia ’s National Federation of Coffee
Growers, said March 30.  Rainfall may ease in June and will very likely return to
historic averages in July as the effects of La Nina diminish,
according to the report.  Arabica coffee for July delivery rose 4.85 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.90 a pound at 12:13 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in
New York. Earlier the price reached $2.9095, the highest since
March 10.  Colombia, which grows coffee all year round, usually
increases its harvest in the second quarter and at year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
