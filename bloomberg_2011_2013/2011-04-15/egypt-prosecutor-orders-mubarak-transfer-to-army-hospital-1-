Egypt ’s public prosecutor has
ordered the transfer of former President  Hosni Mubarak  to a
military hospital, said Adel El Saeed, a spokesman for the
prosecutor’s office.  Mubarak will be detained at Torah Prison near Cairo when
his health improves, El Saeed said. Mubarak has not been
transferred yet and remains in the resort town of Sharm El
Sheikh, he said, without identifying the hospital where the
former ruler will be taken.  Mubarak’s health is stable after he suffered a heart attack
while being questioned and was hospitalized in Sharm El Sheikh
on April 12, Egyptian state television reported yesterday.  The public prosecutor ordered the detention of Mubarak and
his sons, Alaa and Gamal, for 15 days as part of a corruption
investigation. The men were summoned for questioning about
alleged embezzlement of public funds, and attacks on protesters
during the uprising against his regime, the prosecutor said
April 10.  Traffic was normal in Tahrir Square in downtown Cairo
today, the site of a protest by tens of thousands on April 8 to
demand the former leader and his allies be tried quickly.  To contact the reporters on this story:
