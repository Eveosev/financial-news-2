the biggest intraday gain since Dec. 13, and Nieuwe Steen rose
0.9 percent to 14.83 euros. Rotterdam-based Vastned Offices has

rejected an offer in February. There’s no guarantee a merger
will occur, according to today’s statement.  Vastned Offices invests mainly in offices in the  euro zone ,
focusing on the Netherlands, Belgium and  Germany , according to
