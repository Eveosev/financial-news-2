Naiade Resorts Ltd. (NRL) , Mauritius
third-largest hotel operator by market value, advanced to an
almost six-month high on speculation profit for the third
quarter improved.  The stock rose for a fifth day, gaining 1.8 rupees, or 6.6
percent, to 28.9 rupees at the 1:30 p.m. close in Port Louis,
its highest level since Oct. 26, 2010.  “Naiade is rising on hopefully better results for its
third quarter through March as it coincides with the second half
of the peak tourism season,” Imrith Ramtohul, a senior
investment manager who oversees 6 billion rupees ($216 million)
in assets at Mauritius Union Assurance Co., said by phone.  Tourism accounts for the bulk of the Indian Ocean island
nation’s foreign-currency earnings, with Europe accounting for
54 percent of tourists, according to the nation’s tourism
promotion agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
