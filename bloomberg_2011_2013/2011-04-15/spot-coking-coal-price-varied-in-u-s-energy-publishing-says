Metallurgical coal prices were
mixed this week on the U.S. spot market, according to Energy
Publishing Inc.  Spot prices for low-volatility coking coal decreased $3.12,
or 0.9 percent, to $326.88 a ton in the week ended today, the
 Knoxville, Tennessee-based  data provider reported. High-
volatility coal was unchanged at $298.33.  Energy Publishing said producers are seeing some demand
from European buyers.  “But the market is still somewhat thin, and the Brazilians
have not yet begun to buy U.S. product, despite settling some
business with Australian suppliers at around $330 a ton,”
Energy Publishing said.  Energy Publishing says it surveys buyers and sellers of
coal to determine pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
