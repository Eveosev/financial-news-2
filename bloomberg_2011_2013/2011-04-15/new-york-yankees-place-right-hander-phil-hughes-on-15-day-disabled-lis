The  New York Yankees  placed right-
handed pitcher  Phil Hughes , who has a 13.94 earned run average
in three starts this season, on the 15-day disabled list.  Hughes, 24, who is in his fifth season with the Yankees and
was an 18-game winner last season, has allowed 16 runs on 19
hits in 10 1/3 innings this year.  “Something had to be done,” Hughes told reporters today.
“The arm strength is not there. My arm feels dead. There’s
nothing coming out. We have to get it right.”  The Yankees recalled right-hander Lance Pendleton from
Scranton/Wilkes-Barre of the International League to take
Hughes’s spot on the roster and said Bartolo Colon will take
Hughes’s place in the starting rotation.     To contact the editor responsible for this story:
