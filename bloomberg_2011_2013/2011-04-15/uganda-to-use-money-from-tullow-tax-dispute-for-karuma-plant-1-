Uganda ’s government plans to use a
one-time tax payment by  Tullow Oil Plc (TLW)  to help finance the 650-
megawatt Karuma hydroelectric power plant on the Nile river,
said Keith Muhakanizi, deputy secretary to the Treasury.  Tullow, the U.K. explorer focusing on  Africa  and Latin
America, paid $313 million to Uganda linked to the purchase of
Heritage Oil Plc’s interests in two oil blocks in the Lake
Albert basin, the company said on April 13.  “This money is to be used for the construction of
Karuma,” Muhakanizi said, without giving further details.  Uganda estimates the construction of the dam will cost
about $2.2 billion, John Eric Mugyezi, the managing director of
Uganda Electricity Generation Co., said on March 14. The project
will double the country’s generating capacity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
