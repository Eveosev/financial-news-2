New regulations requiring
purchasers of mining licenses in  Turkey  to show they have the
finances and technical ability to act on them have reduced the
number issued by 85 percent,  Sabah  reported.  The regulations were intended to block the practice of
small investors buying mining rights with the sole intention of
reselling them at a profit, which was hindering extraction of
resources, the newspaper reported Energy Minister  Taner Yildiz 
as saying in Ankara.  Turkey is the world’s 10th-most mineral-rich country, with
similar resources to those found in  Africa  and $2.5 trillion-
worth of mineral reserves it hasn’t been able to extract, Sabah
said, citing an incomplete survey by Turkey’s mineral
exploration authorities.  Resources include boron, gold, uranium, coal, iron and
copper, among others, the report said. The number of mining
licenses issued after the regulations were passed in November
dropped to 696 from 4,878 in the same period a year earlier,
Sabah said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
