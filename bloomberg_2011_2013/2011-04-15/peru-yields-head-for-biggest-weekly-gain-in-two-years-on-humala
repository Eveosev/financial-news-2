Peru ’s sol bonds fell, with yields
headed for their biggest rise in 2 1/2 years, as concern former
military rebel Ollanta Humala may win a presidential runoff
sparked a sell-off in the nation’s financial assets.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-denominated
bond due August 2020 has increased 52 basis points, or 0.52
percentage points, this week to 7.15 percent at 12:26 p.m. New
York time, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
biggest weekly increase since October 2008. The yield is up 19
basis points today. The bond’s price plunged 1.29 centimos today
to 104.75 centimos per sol.  “Peruvian markets have been slaughtered and things can
still get worse,” said Kathryn Rooney Vera, an emerging markets
analyst at Bulltick Capital Markets in Miami. “It is entirely
driven by fear of an Humala presidency which looks increasingly
possible.”  Finance Minister Ismael Benavides told reporters yesterday
that the government is concerned about market reaction to the
elections. The fundamentals of the economy don’t justify the
reaction, he said.  The sol surged 2 percent to 2.7665 per  U.S. dollar  from
2.8225 yesterday.  The central bank yesterday sold dollars for the first time
in more than two years after the local currency dropped to a
four-month low. Banco Central de Reserva del Peru sold $91
million and issued 350 million soles ($124 million) of sol-
indexed certificates amid “strong volatility,” it said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
