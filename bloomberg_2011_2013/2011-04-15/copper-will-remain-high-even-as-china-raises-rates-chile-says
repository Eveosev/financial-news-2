Chile , the world’s biggest copper
producer, said prices of the metal probably will remain high
even as China lifts interest rates to combat inflation.  “Beyond the immediate ebb and flows we’re seeing, the
global economy is growing well fundamentally because of emerging
countries,” Chile’s Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said in an
interview in Santiago today. “Under that scenario, we’re going
to continue to have high raw material prices.”  China, the world’s largest consumer of copper, said today
that its economy grew a faster-than-estimated 9.7 percent in the
first quarter from last year as consumer prices in March
expanded 5.4 percent. Copper has climbed 18 percent in the past
year to $4.28 per pound at 1:04 p.m. New York time today.  China  probably will continue to raise interest rates,
Larrain said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
