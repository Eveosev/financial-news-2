A mutiny by members of his guard
forced Burkina Faso’s President Blaise Compaore to flee the
capital, Ouagadougou,  Agence France-Presse  reported, citing
military officials it didn’t identify.  Compaore went to his home town of Ziniare, about 30
kilometers (18 miles) north of the capital, AFP said today.  The revolt by the Presidential Guard has spread to other
military camps, the newswire reported. The guards were
protesting the non-payment of a promised housing benefit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
