The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
bonds from non-payment decreased, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index dropped 3 basis points to 130
as of 9:12 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Deutsche Bank AG. The
risk benchmark is on course for its lowest close since March 25,
data provider CMA prices show.  Swap contracts insuring Japanese government debt against
default were little changed at 85.5 basis points, Deutsche Bank
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell one basis point to 107 basis points
as of 8:06 a.m. in  Singapore , according to Credit Agricole CIB.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped half a basis
point to 105.5 as of 10:06 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
