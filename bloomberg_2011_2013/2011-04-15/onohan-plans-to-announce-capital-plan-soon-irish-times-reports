Ireland’s central bank plans to
announce “very soon” how long Bank of Ireland Plc and Irish
Life & Permanent Plc have to raise new capital, Governor Patrick
Honahan told the  Irish Times .  “I don’t want to anticipate that but it will come very
soon,” Honohan told the newspaper in an interview published on
the website today. The two lenders “have a chance, but it’s not
very flexible” to raise cash themselves and “if they have
potential purchasers, then that is great.”  Honohan also said that he doesn’t want to “second guess”
Bank of Ireland’s ability to raise funds.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
