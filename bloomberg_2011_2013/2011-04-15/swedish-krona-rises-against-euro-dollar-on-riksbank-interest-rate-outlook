Sweden’s krona strengthened amid
speculation that the nation’s central bank will keep raising
interest rates to contain inflation as the economy expands.  The krona appreciated against the euro for a third
consecutive day, with the 17-nation shared currency weakening as
Moody’s Investors Service cut its  credit rating  for Ireland. The
Swedish economy will grow 3.8 percent in 2012, 3.6 percent in
2013, and 4.6 percent this year, the government said on April
13. The Riksbank is predicted to raise its interest rate by 25
basis points to 1.75 percent next week, a survey of economists
by Bloomberg News showed.  “The krona’s stronger as people are looking forward to the
Riksbank rate decision next week,” said  John Hydeskov , chief
analyst at Danske Bank A/S in London. “They are widely expected
to raise the benchmark rate by 25 basis points, which is our
view as well.”  The krona strengthened 0.7 percent versus the euro to
8.9469 as of 4:38 p.m. in  London , for a weekly gain of 0.5
percent. The Swedish currency was 0.3 percent stronger at 6.1961
per dollar. The Norwegian krone strengthened as much as 0.3
percent to 5.3795 against the dollar, the strongest since August
2008.  Danske Bank, Denmark’s biggest bank by assets, today
changed its three-to-six month forecast for the Swedish krona to
8.70 per euro, from 8.50, according to Hydeskov.  ‘Slow Drift’  “We still think the Swedish krona will outperform the
euro,” he said. “We will see a slow drift down to 8.70.” The
 currency pair  last reached that level in December 2000, and
reached 8.7003 on Feb. 16, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The Stockholm-based Riksbank has increased its key rate
five times since the start of July, as it tries to prevent
 Europe ’s fastest-recovering economy from overheating. The bank
raised the rate to 1.5 percent in February from a record low of
0.25 percent last year. It will announce its next decision on
April 20.  Riksbank Governor Stefan Ingves has said he can’t rule out
raising rates at all five remaining policy meetings this year.  The Swedish currency has strengthened 4 percent against a
basket of nine developed-nation peers this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, the best
performance within the group.  Swedish house prices slipped in the three months through
March from the previous quarter as the central bank signaled
interest rates will continue to rise and after the regulator
imposed a cap on mortgage lending.  House prices  for one- or two-
dwelling buildings slipped by 1 percent, Stockholm-based
 Statistics Sweden  said on its website today. From a year
earlier, prices rose 3 percent, the office said.  Norway’s krone strengthened 0.2 percent to 5.3867 per
dollar, and was 0.6 percent stronger at 7.7739 per euro today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
