German electricity for delivery
next year and coal prices were little changed. European carbon
permits advanced.  Baseload power for 2012 rose 20 cents, or 0.3 percent, to
58.60 euros ($84.69), according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 11:32 a.m. Berlin time. Baseload is delivered
around the clock.  The regional benchmark has gained 8.8 percent this year and
last week traded at its highest price since June 2009.  Germany ’s
government last month closed 25 percent of the country’s nuclear
power capacity for a three-month safety review and said its
seven oldest atomic reactors will probably never reopen,
boosting demand for more expensive electricity generated by
burning fossil fuels.  Hard coal for next-year delivery to Amsterdam, Rotterdam or
Antwerp climbed 0.2 percent to $131 a metric ton. The fuel
accounted for about a fifth of Germany’s power last year.
Germany also produces electricity from lignite, or brown coal,
natural gas, wind and solar plants.  EU carbon allowances for December this year rose a third
day, advancing 0.5 percent to 16.87 euros a metric ton on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London .  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
