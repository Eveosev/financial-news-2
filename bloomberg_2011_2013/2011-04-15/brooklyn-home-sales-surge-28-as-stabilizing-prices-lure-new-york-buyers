Home sales in Brooklyn,  New York ’s
most populous borough, surged 28 percent in the first quarter
after a year of stable prices bolstered buyer confidence.  Sales totaled 2,373, up from 1,861 a year earlier, New York
appraiser  Miller Samuel Inc.  and broker  Prudential Douglas
Elliman Real Estate  said today in a joint report. The median
price of properties that changed hands in the period was
$475,000, a 1.9 percent increase from a year earlier and
unchanged from the previous quarter.  “Brooklyn, for the last year, has been stable,”  Jonathan Miller , president of  Miller Samuel , said in an interview. “When
you have an extended period of consistent activity, consumers
are more confident.”  Demand for condos, co-ops and single-family residences rose
in the quarter as  New York City ’s job market improved. The
city’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate of 8.7 in March was
down from 8.9 percent in February and 9.9 percent a year
earlier, the state Department of Labor  said  yesterday.
Financial-industry jobs totaled 169,400 in February, up 6.1
percent from the January 2010 low.  Sales of condominiums increased 61 percent in the first
quarter, with 923 condo units changing hands. Resales and deals
at  new developments  each jumped 61 percent, and the median price
of all condos climbed 7.2 percent to $520,000, according to
Miller Samuel and Prudential.  ‘Venturing Out’  Co-op sales rose 14 percent in the quarter and the median
price increased 8.5 percent, to $295,000. Sales of one- to
three-family houses in the borough climbed 12 percent from a
year earlier as the median price fell 3.7 percent.  “This suggests that buyers have been venturing out in
larger numbers and taking advantage of discounts” before prices
rise, Miller said. Values for all borough properties are 12
percent lower than at the peak of the market in the third
quarter of 2007, he said.  The inventory of available properties jumped 27 percent in
the first quarter as once-hesitant homeowners decided to sell
amid strong buyer demand, Miller said.  “That element is consistent with this idea of improved
confidence,” he said.  A total of 7,316 properties were  listed for sale  in
 Brooklyn  at the end of the first quarter, 17 percent more than
the average quarterly inventory for the last five years,
according to Miller.  Price Discounts  Brooklyn properties stayed on the market an average of 129
days, a 13 percent increase from a year earlier. Sellers pared
an average of 4.8 percent off their original asking price to
strike a deal in the quarter, compared with a 3.6 percent
discount offered at the beginning of 2010.  The Cobble Hill neighborhood had the largest median price
increase for condos and co-ops. Values jumped 80 percent to
$857,000, according to a separate  report  released yesterday by
the Real Estate Board of New York.  The median price of apartments that changed hands in Park
Slope climbed 18 percent to $629,000. Condos and co-ops in
 Brooklyn Heights  sold for a median of $590,000, a 10 percent
decrease from a year ago, according to the trade group.  In Queens, the city’s second-most-populous borough,
sales plunged 17 percent in the first quarter to 2,598, and the
median price climbed 1.4 percent to $350,000, according to
Miller Samuel and Prudential. The inventory of available
properties increased 12 percent to 13,609.  To contact the reporter on this story:
