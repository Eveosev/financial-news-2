The U.S. is poised to contribute
$100 million to an international food program, a payment that
should allow the initiative to attract other donations and fund
new initiatives in other countries, Treasury Undersecretary Lael Brainard said today.  Now that Congress has approved a budget for the rest of
fiscal year 2011, the U.S. will transfer the money to the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program, Brainard said in prepared
remarks for a speech at a development conference. The event took
place as officials from the Group of 20 nations and
 International Monetary Fund  meet in  Washington .  “We are confident that this contribution will unlock new
funds from other G-20 development partners so that the fund can
extend additional grant awards to some of the 20 African
countries that have submitted proposals,” Brainard said.  The U.S. will be working with multilateral development
banks to help African nations get infrastructure financing,
particularly in the early stages of projects, she said. “Non-
traditional donors, such as  China , provide comparable levels of
financing for African infrastructure, but do so without the
procurement and environmental standards” of the development
banks, Brainard said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
