First Bank of Nigeria Plc (FIRSTBAN) , the
country’s second-biggest lender by market value, plans to grow
loans 10 percent this year and boost market share in retail and
corporate banking, Chief Financial Officer Bayo Adelabu said.  First Bank’s loans advanced 6 percent in 2010 and the bank
will be conservative in its target for 2011 because it doesn’t
want to “worsen its loan books,” Adelabu said in a phone
interview yesterday in Lagos, the commercial capital. The bank’s
non-performing loans ratio fell to 7.7 percent in 2010, from 8.2
percent a year earlier and should decline further this year, he
said.  Nigerian lenders are starting to increase lending after
cutting back as they tried to recover from a debt crisis in 2008
and 2009 that threatened the industry with a collapse. The
 Central Bank of Nigeria  injected 620 billion naira ($4 billion)
into the industry, and fired the chief executive officers of
eight of the country’s lenders. First Bank wasn’t one of the
lenders bailed out.  First Bank’s net income for full-year 2010 jumped to 33.4
billion naira from 4.9 billion naira, while income before tax
more than tripled to 43.2 billion naira, it said in a statement
on the website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  yesterday.  Given changes in  Nigeria ’s banking industry, including
mergers and acquisitions, “competition will become more
intense,” Adelabu said.  “There may not be any small bank
anymore.”  Mergers and Acquisitions  Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  and Intercontinental Bank, one of the
lenders bailed out in 2009, agreed to merge. Afribank Plc, also
a bailed-out lender, signed a memorandum of understanding with
potential investor Vine Capital Partners Ltd., it said on April
7. Union Bank of Nigeria Plc signed an agreement for a group led
by African Capital Alliance to invest $750 million in the bank,
the lender said on March 23.  FirstRand Ltd. (FSR) ,  South Africa ’s
second-biggest financial services company, said yesterday it
plans to buy a majority stake in Sterling Bank Plc.  First Bank will respond to these changes by taking
advantage of its low-cost deposit base that will “give it a
pricing advantage,” Adelabu said.  First Bank declined 22 kobo, or 1.6 percent, to 13.66 naira
by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
