United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a
Nigerian lender, headed for the highest close in more than a
week after saying it plans to issue bonus shares and as profit
more than doubled in the first quarter.  The stock gained 20 kobo, or 2.5 percent, to 8.20 naira by
1:01 p.m. in Lagos. A close at that price will be its strongest
since April 7.  UBA will pay a dividend of 5 kobo per share and give a
bonus of one share for every four already held, it said in a
statement yesterday. Separately, it said profit more than
doubled to 3.9 billion naira ($25.2 million) in the first
quarter through March compared with 1.56 billion naira a year
earlier, according to a statement on the Nigerian bourse’s
website.  “The stock is rising because of the bonus share it
announced yesterday, and also its first-quarter results,”
Adesoji Solanke, Lagos-based banking analyst at  Renaissance
Capital , said by phone today. “Retail investors in  Nigeria  are
usually excited about bonus issues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
