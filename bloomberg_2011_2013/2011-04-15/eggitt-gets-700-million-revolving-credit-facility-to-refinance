Meggitt Plc (MGGT) , the maker of engine-
monitoring systems for Airbus SAS and  Boeing Co. (BA)  planes, said it
got a $700 million credit line to refinance existing debt.  The five-year revolving credit replaces a facility signed
in 2007, the Christchurch, England-based company said today in a
statement. Money in a revolving credit can be borrowed again
once it’s been repaid.  Meggitt’s financing from 2007 includes a $920 million
credit line expiring next year, and a $500 million facility that
finishes in 2013, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The new revolving credit was provided by 12 banks, the
company said in the statement without supplying details. Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, Lloyds Banking Group Plc, BNP Paribas SA
and  Barclays Capital  arranged the previous transaction,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
