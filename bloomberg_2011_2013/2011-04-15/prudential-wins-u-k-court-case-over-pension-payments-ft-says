Prudential Plc (PRU) , one of Britain’s
biggest insurance companies, won a case in the  London  High Court
brought by the trustees of its own employees’ retirement fund,
the Financial Times reported.  The judge, Justice Newey, ruled that Prudential was within
its rights in changing the basis on which discretionary pension
increases were granted to members of its final-salary pension
plan, the newspaper said.  The case centers on a decision by the company in 2005 to
increase payments in line with the Retail Price Index, but only
to a limit of 2.5 percent a year, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
