website.  The Platform gained 4 percentage points from the previous
poll on March 24-28, while Law & Justice, the biggest opposition
party, gained 1 percentage point to 30 percent. The Democratic
 Left Alliance  garnered 11 percent support, down from 15 percent
in the previous poll, followed by the Polish Peasants Party with
