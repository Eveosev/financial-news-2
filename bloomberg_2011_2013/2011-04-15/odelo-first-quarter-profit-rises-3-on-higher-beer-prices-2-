Grupo Modelo SAB, the Mexican
brewer of Corona beer, said first-quarter profit rose 3 percent
as increased shipments to the U.S. and  Mexico  made up for higher
marketing expenses and employee bonuses.  Net income increased to 2.16 billion pesos ($184 million)
from 2.09 billion pesos a year earlier, the Mexico City-based
company said in a statement. Sales at Modelo, the country’s
largest brewer, gained 9.6 percent to 19.3 billion pesos.  Modelo’s domestic sales have been helped by a recovery in
 consumer spending . Earlier this month, Mexico’s  Finance Ministry 
raised its annual growth estimate to 4.3 percent from 4 percent.  Celso Sanchez, an analyst with the Mexican brokerage unit
of Citigroup Inc., had estimated in an April 12 report that
Modelo’s profit would rise to 2.13 billion pesos on sales of
18.6 billion pesos.  Beer shipments in Mexico totaled 8.7 million hectoliters,
up about 12 percent from a year earlier, when they fell 5.7
percent because of inclement weather and a late-2009 price
increase to make up for higher beer taxes. Export shipments rose
about 15 percent to 3.5 million hectoliters. A hectoliter is
equal to 100 liters.  ‘More Conservative’  Operating expenses rose 12 percent to 5.7 billion pesos
because of increased marketing and distribution costs as well as
higher spending on  information technology , Modelo said. Higher
profit-sharing payments to employees and write-offs of fixed
assets caused other expenses to more than triple to 494 million
pesos.  The shares advanced 70 centavos to 74.05 pesos at 12:32
p.m. New York time in Mexico City trading. The benchmark IPC
index of 37 Mexican stocks slipped 0.2 percent to 37,004.92.  Modelo has a “more conservative” outlook for the second
half of the year as it expects higher grain and malt costs,
which the brewer hasn’t hedged against, Chief Financial Officer
Emilio Fullaondo said in a conference call. The brewer aims to
keep prices “consistent” this year, even as it remains
vigilant about changes made by other companies in the sector, he
said.  “It’s important to see how our competitors react” on
pricing to address market conditions, Fullaondo said. “It’s
something that we’ll be watching very closely over the next
couple of months.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
