OAO Polymetal, a Russian producer
of gold and silver, snapped four days of losses as gold gained
to a record and silver climbed the highest in 31 years.  The stock increased 5.4 percent to 599.5 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, its biggest gain since Feb. 21.  Both metals have rallied on increased investment demand for
commodities and concern that currencies may be debased as
central banks stimulate their economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
