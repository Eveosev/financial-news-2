OAO Sberbank Chief Executive
Officer  German Gref  is seeking to double the proportion of
profit paid in the annual dividend from 12 percent last year to
as much as 25 percent within several years, the Wall Street
Journal reported, citing an interview.  Gref also said the state would only sell as much as 7.6
percent of the bank later this year if the market conditions
were right - “we will be very careful not to hurt our share
price,” Gref told the newspaper.  He said he intended to keep Russia’s largest bank showing a
return on equity of between 15 and 20 percent, and added that it
now sought to expand outside the country, the WSJ said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
