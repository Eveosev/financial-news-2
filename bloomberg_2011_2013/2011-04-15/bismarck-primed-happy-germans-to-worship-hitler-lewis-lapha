When in 1863 Emperor Franz Joseph
summoned German royals for talks on unifying under Austrian
rule, Otto von Bismarck was not happy. He had plans of his own
for  Germany . His sovereign, King William I, was rather more
excited to be part of this Congress of Princes.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  The struggle between the king and his recently appointed
prime minister left both ill and exhausted. On the one side was
the absolute monarch; on the other, the wily and domineering
politician with no real power base.  Bismarck prevailed and for the next 25 years played off
enemies and friends to unify Germany with his cynical form of
Realpolitik.  William complained that it was “hard to be Emperor under
Bismarck,” but retained the Iron Chancellor in office.  By creating a political machine designed mainly to keep
himself at the top, Bismarck created a power vacuum that allowed
the next ambitious tyrant --  Adolf Hitler  -- to take over a
pliant German people.  I spoke with Jonathan Steinberg, author of “Bismarck: A
Life,” on the following topics:  1. Detested Functionary  2. The Prussian Tradition  3. Gargantuan Appetites  4. German Unification  5. Road to Hitler  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
