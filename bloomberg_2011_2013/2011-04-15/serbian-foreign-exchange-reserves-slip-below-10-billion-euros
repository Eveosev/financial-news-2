Serbia â€™s foreign-exchange reserves
dropped to 9.9 billion euros ($14.3 billion) in March, falling
by 142.1 million euros as the country repaid debts to foreign
and domestic creditors, the National Bank of Serbia said.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and cash the country drew from the
 International Monetary Fund  under a 3 billion-euro bailout loan,
fell to 5.13 billion euros from 5.24 billion euros in February,
the  Narodna Banka Srbije  in Serbia said today in an e-mail.  The central bank spent 73.4 million euros in March on
external debt repayments, up from 11.4 million euros, the
central bank said. Reserves at the end of March were equivalent
to 447 percent of M1 money supply, down from 452 percent the
previous month and enough to cover eight months of imports.  Commercial banks held 1.33 billion euros in foreign-
exchange reserves at the end of the month, up from 1.32 billion
euros at the end of February, the central bank said.  Interbank trading volumes rose in March to 1.28 billion
euros from 869.8 million euros in February, bringing the three-
month total to 3.3 billion euros, the central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
