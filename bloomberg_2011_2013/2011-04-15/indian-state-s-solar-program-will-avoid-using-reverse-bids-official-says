India ’s Maharashtra state, home to
the country’s financial capital of Mumbai, will avoid the
reverse-bidding process used in the first national solar auction
that led to “unbankable” projects, an official said.  “It won’t be reverse-bidding,” H.M. Kulkarni, general
manager at the  Maharashtra Energy Development Agency , said in an
interview in Mumbai today. “We’ve seen how that has led to some
issues with aggressive bids and that projects aren’t bankable.”  The agency has submitted a draft solar power policy to the
state government which targets the development of 500 megawatts
of solar power capacity over three years, he said.  The policy is expected to be approved within a month or
two, he said.  India’s National Solar Mission program, which aims to build
20,000 megawatts of sun-powered plants by 2022, completed its
first auction last year. Project developers offering to sell the
solar power to be produced at the lowest rates won licenses to
build plants in a process known as reverse bidding.  Kulkarni spoke on the sidelines of Renewable Markets
India’s Global Solar Investment Summit in  Mumbai .  To contact the reporter on this story:
