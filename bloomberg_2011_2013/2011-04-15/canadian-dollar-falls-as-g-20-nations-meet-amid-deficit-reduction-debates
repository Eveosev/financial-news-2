Canada ’s dollar fell against its
U.S. counterpart as Group of 20 governments meet today and
officials from the U.S. to Europe debate economic policies.  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed, declined as crude
oil futures declined.  Raw materials , including oil, account for
about half of Canada’s exports. The International Monetary Fund
and G-20 nations are gathering in Washington this week as the
U.S. and Europe debate when and how to rein in budget deficits.  The Canadian dollar “is biased toward a little bit of
weakness,” said Michael O’Neill, managing director at
Knightsbridge Foreign Exchange Inc. in Toronto. “It’s going to
retreat a bit on profit-taking ahead of a weekend with the G-
20.”  The loonie weakened 0.4 percent to 96.46 cents per  U.S.
dollar  at 8:16 a.m. in Toronto. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0367.  To contact the reporter for this story:
