Peruvian President Alan Garcia
today said he’s not considering a pardon for former President
 Alberto Fujimori , who is serving a 25-year prison sentence for
human rights violations.  “It’s never been proposed nor is it in my agenda,” said
Garcia in a statement posted on the presidential  website .  Fujimori was jailed in 2009 on charges involving orders for
two massacres while he was president from 1990 to 2000. His
daughter, Keiko Fujimori, will face opposition politician
Ollanta Humala in a June 5 presidential runoff.  Congressman Rolando Sousa, a spokesman for Fujimori’s
party, said today that Keiko Fujimori wouldn’t pardon her
father, if she’s elected.  Garcia’s five-year term expires in July.  To contact the reporters on this story:
