The  European Union  is claiming 530
million euros ($766 million) of “unduly spent” farm payments
from member states, with about 50 percent due from  Greece .  The money spent didn’t comply with EU rules or “inadequate
control procedures” on agriculture spending were found, the
European Commission, the bloc’s regulatory arm, said in an e-
mailed statement today.  Greece will have to pay back 259.61 million euros,
according to the commission. Funds will also be recovered from
Bulgaria, Denmark,  Spain , France, Italy, the Netherlands,
Portugal, Romania and the U.K. A “small” amount will be
refunded to  Germany , it said.  The EU agriculture budget amounted to 43.6 billion euros in
2010 excluding funds for rural development, according to the
commission. Reclaimed money will be withheld from future
payments as part of the 27-nation bloc’s Common Agricultural
Policy, the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
