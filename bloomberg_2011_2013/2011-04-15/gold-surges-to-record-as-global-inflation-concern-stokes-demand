Gold rose to a record in  New York 
on speculation that the sovereign-debt crisis in  Europe  will
worsen, boosting the appeal of the precious metal as an
alternative to currencies. Silver touched a 31-year high.  Gold reached an all-time high of $1,489.10 an ounce after
Moody’s cut Ireland’s credit rating by two levels to the lowest
investment grade, eroding the value of the euro. The dollar,
while up today, is headed for a third straight weekly decline
against a basket of currencies as the U.S. Congress debates
measures to reduce a record government deficit.  “Gold has become the currency of choice,” said Lannie
Cohen, the president of Capitol Commodity Services Inc. in
Indianapolis. “The debt crises in Portugal and Ireland are
getting worse. The U.S. has its own deficit problems. There’s
just so much debt that the U.S. will have to continue
quantitative easing to carry the deficit.”  Gold futures for June delivery rose $13.60, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at $1,486 at 1:46 p.m. on the Comex, up 0.8 percent
for the week. Gold for immediate delivery in  London  rose as much
as 0.9 percent to a record $1,488.18.  The precious metal may rise to $1,750 this year in
anticipation of “the dollar getting ready to fall off the face
of the earth,” Cohen said.  The  Federal Reserve  has kept its benchmark interest rate at
zero percent to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and has pledged
to buy $600 billion in Treasuries through June to stimulate
growth.  Inflation Concern  Gold also rallied on demand from investors seeking a hedge
against inflation.  Consumer prices in  China , the world’s fastest-growing major
economy, rose 5.4 percent in March, the quickest pace since
2008, exceeding the government’s 2011 target for a third month.  Inflation in the 17-nation euro region quickened to 2.7
percent in March from 2.4 percent in February, the European
Union’s statistics office said today. U.S. wholesale costs
climbed 5.8 percent in March compared with a year earlier, and
the government said today that the cost of living rose for a
ninth straight month.  “The inflationary numbers in the backdrop are very bullish
for gold,” said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market strategist
at Lind-Waldock in  Chicago . “With the sovereign-debt problems
in Europe and the U.S., investors want metals to protect them.”  Silver Surges  Silver topped $42, pushing its gain this year to 38
percent, the most among the 19 commodities tracked by the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index.  Silver futures for May delivery rose 90.7 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $42.571 an ounce on the Comex in New York. Earlier,
the price climbed to $42.865, the highest since 1980, when the
metal reached a record $50.35.  The commodity advanced 4.8 percent this week, the fourth
straight increase.  Palladium futures for June delivery fell $6.15, or 0.8
percent, to $768.10 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Prices dropped 3.3 percent this week.  Platinum futures for July delivery declined 80 cents to
$1,794.80 an ounce on the Nymex, capping a 1 percent loss for
the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
