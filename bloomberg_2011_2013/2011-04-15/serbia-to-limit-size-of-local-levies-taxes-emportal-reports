Serbia â€™s central government will
set limits on which local authorities can impose levies and
taxes on businesses registered or who are active in their
territory,  Emportal  website reported, citing Labor Minister
Rasim Ljajic.  The move will address complaints from investors that
districts and municipalities vastly increased the duties since
the recession in an attempt to make up for dwindling budget
transfers from the central authorities, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
