DBS Group Holdings Ltd. (DBS) , Southeast
Asia’s biggest bank, plans to open at least eight new branches
in  China  this year and double its workforce as it seeks to
reduce its reliance on Singapore.  The bank will hire people mainly for its consumer and
institutional banking services in China, according to an e-
mailed statement today. DBS added three outlets this year in the
Asian nation, taking the total to 19, and plans to have 50
branches and sub-branches by 2013, it said. The Singapore-based
lender employs more than 1,000 people in China.  The bank aims to generate about 40 percent of revenue from
its home market in five years, down from about two-thirds now,
according to a plan unveiled in February. The Greater China
region would make up 30 percent, DBS has said.  South Asia  and
the rest of  Southeast Asia  may contribute another 30 percent.  “China is a very important market for DBS and surely the
cornerstone for our Greater China strategy,” Peter Seah Lim Huat, chairman of DBS, said at a press conference in  Shanghai 
today. “We expect that profitability of DBS China will continue
to grow.”  DBS, which doubled profit in China to more than 250 million
yuan ($38 million) last year, said the unit would become a
“significant profit contributor” to the group in the next five
to 10 years, Seah said.  “Even with 50 branches by 2013, it’s still very small for
a country with a size like China,” said Seah. “We will spend
whatever’s necessary to continue to build our foundation.”  DBS fell 0.95 percent to S$14.66 in  Singapore  trading today,
extending its loss over the past year to 5.7 percent.  China opened its banking industry to overseas companies in
December 2006, sparking competition among foreign lenders for
the nation’s corporate and household savings, which reached $10
trillion in January. The country’s loan growth averaged 20
percent from 2006 to 2010, according to government data.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
