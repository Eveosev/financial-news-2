OAO Rosneft will ask for a four-
year extension of two licenses to explore offshore blocks in the
 Black Sea , which it planned to develop with  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  and
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , Kommersant said, citing unidentified people.
  Rosneft will ask the government to prolong the licence to Val
Shatskogo project with Chevron and the license to the Tuapse
trough with Exxon until the end of 2017, the newspaper said.
Chevron may exit the Val Shatskogo venture this month, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
