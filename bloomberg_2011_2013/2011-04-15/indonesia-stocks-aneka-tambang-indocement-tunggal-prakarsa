Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  advanced 22.53 points, or 0.6
percent, to 3,730.51. The gauge fell 0.3 percent this week, the
first decline in four weeks.  PT Aneka Tambang (ANTM IJ), a nickel and gold producer,
rose 2.2 percent to 2,350 rupiah, the most since March 30, after
gold surged to a record. Immediate-delivery bullion, which has
rallied every year since 2001, gained as much as 0.4 percent to
$1,479.35 an ounce and was at $1,476 at 2:03 p.m. in  Singapore .
Gold for June delivery in  New York  climbed to an all-time high
of $1,480.50.  PT Indocement Tunggal Prakarsa (INTP IJ), the second-
biggest cement maker, added 2.4 percent to 17,000 rupiah, the
highest close since Dec. 8. Deutsche Bank AG said in a report
yesterday  Indonesia ’s cement sales in March advanced 15 percent
from a month earlier. The brokerage remains “upbeat on the
cement sector” amid expectation prices of the building material
will rise in the second quarter, Rachman Koeswanto, an analyst
at Deutsche Bank in Jakarta, wrote in the report.  PT Media Nusantara Citra (MNCN IJ), a television
broadcasting company, fell 3.5 percent to 820 rupiah, the lowest
close since Jan. 24.  Media Nusantara said a court ruled “null and void” a 2005
shareholders’ meeting resolution on the transfer of a 75 percent
stake in MNCTV to PT Berkah Karya Bersama. Media Nusantara
acquired MNCTV in 2006 and the ruling doesn’t have “any
impact” on its 75 percent holding in the unit, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
