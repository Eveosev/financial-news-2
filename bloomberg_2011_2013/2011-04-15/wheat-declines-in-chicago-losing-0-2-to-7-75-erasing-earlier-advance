Wheat futures declined for the
fifth straight day on speculation that higher shipments of the
grain from Ukraine may boost global supply. Corn and soybeans
also fell.  Ukraine has the potential to boost grain exports to 22
million or 23 million metric tons in the season starting July 1,
from about 11 million tons this season, Serhiy Feofilov, the
head of researcher UkrAgroConsult, said yesterday.  “There’s an expectation that a good Northern Hemisphere
crop will weigh on prices,” Simon Clancy, manager for the
export brokerage at FCStone Australia Pty., said by phone from
Sydney. “We’re already seeing signs of that out of Russian and
Ukrainian markets.”  Wheat for July delivery declined 6.5 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $7.6975 a bushel by 10:40 a.m. London time on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. It is set for a 7.5 percent loss this week.
Milling wheat for May delivery on NYSE Liffe in Paris fell 2.255
euros, or 1 percent, to 235.50 euros ($340.56).  Grain harvests in  Russia  may range between 80 million tons
and 88 million tons this year, the Institute for Agricultural
Market Studies said yesterday. That compares with the
institute’s estimate of 84 million tons in February.  Russia banned grain exports from Aug. 15 to at least July 1
as drought wiped out 37 percent of its crops. Russia was the
world’s second-largest exporter of wheat in the 2009-2010
season, before grain crops in the country suffered from the
worst drought in at least half a century.  Soybeans fell on speculation South American inventories
will be larger than previously expected, increasing exportable
supplies of the oilseed.  Brazilian Exports  South American soybean production will rise 1.3 percent to
a record 141.4 million tons this year, researcher Oil World said
in a report this week. Exports from  Brazil , the world’s second-
biggest shipper behind the U.S., will rise 13 percent to 33
million tons, Oil World said.  Soybeans for July delivery declined 7.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $13.355 a bushel in Chicago, set for a 4.9 percent
loss this week. July-delivery corn lost 8.25 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $7.5275 a bushel in Chicago. The contract is set for
a 2.7 percent loss this week, the first weekly decline in five.  To contact the reporter on this story:
