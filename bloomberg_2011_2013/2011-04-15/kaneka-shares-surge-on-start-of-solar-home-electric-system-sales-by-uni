Kaneka Corp. (4118)  gained the most in two
weeks in Tokyo trading after the Japanese maker of synthetic
resins was reported to have started operating a unit to sell
home solar-power systems.  The shares rose as much as 4.7 percent to 582 yen, the
biggest increase since March 30, and traded at 566 yen at 2:25
p.m. local time.  Kaneka aims to sell 20 billion yen ($240 million) of solar
systems by March 2013 and raise its market share to 10 percent
from about 1 to 3 percent, Kaneka spokesman Takeji Kobuki said
by phone when asked to respond to a Nikkei newspaper report on
the plans. The report didnâ€™t say where it got the information.  The unit, which began operating on April 11, has nearly
doubled its sales staff from when it was first created in
October, Kobuki said.  Japan  is increasingly looking at alternative energy
following the March 11 earthquake in the northeast that crippled
nuclear reactors. The country has experienced rolling blackouts
and faces more power shortages in the coming months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
