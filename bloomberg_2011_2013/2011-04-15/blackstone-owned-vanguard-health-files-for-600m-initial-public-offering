Vanguard Health Systems, two-thirds
owned by the Blackstone Group, filed to sell $600 million worth
of shares in an initial public offering.  No underwriters were listed in the IPO filing today with
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The company said in
the filing that it will trade under the symbol VHS on the New
York Stock Exchange.  Vanguard, based in Nashville,  Tennessee , owns 26 hospitals
in five states, as well as health insurance plans. It had $3.38
billion in revenue during the year ending June 30, 2010,
according to the filing. The IPO would be the 10th in the
health-care industry in the past three months, according to
Bloomberg data.  Funds led by New York-based Blackstone bought the hospital
company in 2004 for $1.75 billion, according to Bloomberg data.
Vanguard plans to use the money from the IPO to pay $747 million
in remaining debt that was taken on to pay investors in the
company, according to the filing. Money left over from the IPO
will be used to make acquisitions.  Last month, HCA Holdings Inc., the hospital chain whose
owners include KKR & Co. and Bain Capital LLC, raised $3.79
billion in its IPO, the largest ever by a private equity-backed
company, according to Preqin Ltd. Companies owned by leveraged
buyout firms raised about $19.5 billion worldwide through IPOs
in the first quarter, more than half their total for all of
2010, data compiled by Bloomberg and London-based Preqin show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
