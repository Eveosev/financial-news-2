Mondi Plc,  Europe ’s largest maker
of office paper, said it issued a 750 million-euro ($1.1
billion), five-year multi-currency revolving credit facility to
refinance existing debt.  The facility was arranged by Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas
SA, Citigroup Inc., Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG, Erste
Group Bank AG, Societe Generale Corporate & Investment Banking,
Raiffeisen Bank International AG, the Royal Bank of Scotland Plc
and UniCredit SpA, the company said in a statement to
Johannesburg’s bourse today.  The transaction completes Mondi’s refinancing of its 1.55
billion-euro facility that was due to mature in June 2012. The
company issued a 500 million-euro, seven-year Eurobond in March
last year to help pay down existing debt. The notes due 2017
fell, raising the yield by 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 5.20 percent at 9:05 a.m. in Johannesburg.  “The success of this transaction further strengthens the
group by extending our debt maturity profile and provides us
with additional financial flexibility,” Chief Financial Officer
 Andrew King  said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
