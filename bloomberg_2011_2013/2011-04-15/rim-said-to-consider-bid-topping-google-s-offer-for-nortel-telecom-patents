Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  is
considering a bid for Nortel Networks Corp.’s portfolio of
wireless technology patents that would top  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s $900
million offer, two people familiar with the plans said.  RIM, maker of the BlackBerry smartphone, is considering
whether to bid alone for the assets or to potentially save money
on a joint bid to stop Google acquiring all 6,000 Nortel patents
and patent applications, one of the people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
