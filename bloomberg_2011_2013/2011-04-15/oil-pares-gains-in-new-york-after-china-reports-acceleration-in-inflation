Oil slipped, heading for its first
weekly decline in  New York  in a month, amid concern that this
year’s rally in prices is stoking inflation and starting to
erode fuel demand.  Futures pared earlier gains after Chinese data showed that
inflation in the world’s biggest energy user accelerated in
March to the fastest pace since 2008. Total U.S. crude
inventories rose 1.63 million barrels to 359.3 million last week
as refiners slowed processing rates, the Energy Department said
on April 13. NATO’s chief said the alliance needs more attack
jets to target Libyan ground forces as Qaddafi’s troops continue
their attacks.  “Crude  oil prices  have pushed ahead of where fundamentals
currently suggest,” analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. led by
 Jeffrey Currie  in  London  wrote in a report today. “The near-
term downside risk to prices has risen in recent weeks” on
“nascent signs of demand destruction in the United States.”  Crude for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile Exchange 
was at $107.93 a barrel, down 17 cents, at 9:51 a.m. London time
after falling as much as 45 cents to $107.66. The contract has
declined 4.3 percent this week. Brent oil for June settlement
was up 13 cents at $122.13 a barrel on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange. London futures are headed for a 3.2
percent loss this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
