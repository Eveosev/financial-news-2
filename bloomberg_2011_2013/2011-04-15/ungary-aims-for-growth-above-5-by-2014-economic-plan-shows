Hungary seeks to achieve annual
economic growth of more than 5 percent by 2014, according to its
 Convergence Plan  submitted to the European Commission.  Growth may be 3.2 percent this year, 3.6 percent next, 4.8
percent in 2013, 5.2 percent in 2014 and 5.5 percent in 2015,
according to a "dynamic" scenario that shows Cabinet targets,
the Cabinet said in the document received in e-mail today. A
"conservative" model, on which the plan is based, estimates
growth of 3.1 percent this year, 3 percent in 2012, 3.2 percent
in 2013, 3.3 percent in 2014 and 3.5 percent in 2015.  The plan "is built on the strictly conservative mid-term
macroeconomic scenario" even as the government is "confident
that the structural reforms presented" may "result in higher
potential growth due to qualitative improvement of
competitiveness," according to the report.  Hungary , which missed the European Union’s deficit target
every year since it joined the bloc in 2004, is cutting welfare
spending to make financing sustainable after relying on industry
taxes and the effective nationalization of private pension funds
to plug budget holes last year and this year. The Cabinet plans
to save 900 billion forint ($4.8 billion) annually by 2013.  The government expects consumer-price inflation to slow to
an average of 3.4 percent next year and 3 percent by 2013,
according to the “conservative” forecast of the plan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
