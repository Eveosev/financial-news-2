The inflation rate in  Italy ,
the euro-region’s third-biggest economy, jumped last month to
the highest since October 2008 as the cost of energy and food
rose.  Inflation based on European Union measurements quickened to
2.8 percent from 2.1 percent in February, Rome-based national
statistics office Istat said in a final report today. The
March rate was higher than the 2.6 percent reported on March 31.  Prices advanced 2.2 percent from February, more than the 2
percent first reported.  Based on Italian methodology, prices gained 0.4 percent
from February and advanced 2.5 percent from a year earlier,
Istat said, confirming the initial readings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
