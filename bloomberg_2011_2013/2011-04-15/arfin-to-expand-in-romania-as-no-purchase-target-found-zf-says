Marfin Popular Bank Pcl, the
second-biggest Cypriot lender, said it will expand in  Romania  by
opening branches after failing to find an “interesting”
acquisition opportunity in the country, Ziarul Financiar
reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Thimios Bouloutas.  The lender plans to increase its assets in Romania to 1
billion euros ($1.4 billion) by the end of next year, from the
current 600 million euros, and open five branches in its first
expansion stage, the newspaper said. Marfin aims to increase its
market share in Romania to between 3 percent and 5 percent in
the medium term, from less than 1 percent, Ziarul Financiar
cited Boloutas as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
