European stocks were little changed
as  China ’s inflation accelerated in March to the fastest pace
since 2008, outweighing better-than-forecast results at
companies from Nestle SA to Syngenta AG. U.S. index futures and
Asian shares retreated.  Nestle advanced 1.1 percent after the world’s largest food
company reported first-quarter organic sales growth that topped
the average analyst estimate. Syngenta gained 1.2 percent after
the world’s biggest maker of agricultural chemicals posted
first-quarter sales at the top end of a range of analysts’
projections as higher grain prices spurred farmers to invest.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index retreated 0.1 percent
to 276.76 at 9:05 a.m. in  London . The measure has retreated 1.8
percent this week as  Japan  said its stricken Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear power plant may release more radiation than Chernobyl
and Alcoa Inc. began the U.S. earnings season with sales that
missed analysts’ estimates . Google Inc. dropped in German
trading after reporting profit excluding some items that fell
short of the average analyst estimate.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
