Argentina ’s 2011 economic growth
forecast was raised to 8 percent from 5 percent by Nomura
Securities International as  South America ’s second-biggest
economy surges on domestic demand and rising commodity prices.  “The strong consumption boom is very apparent in
Argentina,” said Nomura economist  Boris Segura  in a report
released today by e-mail. “This situation is aided by loose
monetary conditions, which keep interest rates negative in real
terms and have prompted a rapid increase in  consumer credit .”  Argentina’s economy expanded 9.2 percent in 2010, the most
in five years. Still, Segura lowered his 2012 growth forecast to
4 percent from 4.7 percent, saying that recent government moves,
such as exerting more control over company boards, may dampen
private investment.  Even as Argentina’s economy expands for a ninth consecutive
year, according to official figures, consumer prices accelerated
26.6 percent last year, according to Buenos Aires-based research
company Ecolatina. That estimate is more than double the 10.9
percent inflation reported by the national statistics agency.  “Given negative real  interest rates , a stable dollar and
the lack of savings alternatives, consumers are also turning to
durable goods as the ultimate inflation hedge,” Segura wrote in
the report. “Private consumption is also being further
underpinned by strong government expenditure on pensions and
other transfers.”  Sales of such goods as home appliances, toys and clothing
soared 39.5 percent in December from a year earlier, the biggest
increase for that month since at least 1998. Auto sales last
year gained 43.3 percent in unit terms, the most since 2004.  Segura said he expects the government’s primary spending to
accelerate in coming months after expanding 34 percent in
February from a year earlier, “adding more stimulus to the
economy.”  The peso, which last year fell 4.5 percent, the most among
Latin America’s major currencies, declined 0.1 percent today to
4.0687 per dollar at 12:32 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
