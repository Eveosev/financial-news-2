Gasoline futures advanced as
refinery shutdowns in the East Coast reduced production of the
motor fuel.  Futures gained as unit outages, including a fluid catalytic
cracker at Sunoco Inc.’s Philadelphia refinery closed after a
fire, reduced fuel production. The Energy Department reported
April 13 that crude processed in East Coast plants slumped 27
percent to 615,000 barrels a day, the fewest since the
department began listing weekly data in 1992.  “The continuing problems from Sunoco on the East Coast are
tightening the gasoline supply,” said  Andy Lipow , president of
Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for May delivery rose 1.98 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $3.2545 a gallon at 9:30 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  Thomas Golembeski, a Sunoco spokesman in Philadelphia,
declined in an e-mail today to comment on the status of the
catalytic cracker.  The 194,000-barrel-a-day refinery supplies fuel to New York
Harbor, the delivery point for New York Mercantile Exchange
gasoline and heating oil futures.  U.S. supplies of the motor fuel sank 7 million barrels, or
3.2 percent, last week, according to department data. It was the
biggest drop since October 1998. Inventories in the East Coast
fell to the lowest since the week ended Dec. 3.  Heating oil for May delivery added 0.8 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $3.197 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular gasoline at the pump increased 0.3 cent to $3.815 a
gallon yesterday, AAA said on its website. That’s the highest
price since Sept. 18, 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
