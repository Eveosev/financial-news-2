Treasuries rose, heading for their
first weekly gain in a month, on speculation the economy will
lose momentum as the government and central bank curtail
stimulus.  The financial market has confidence in the U.S.’s ability
to reduce its  budget deficit  after President Barack Obama vowed
to cut $4 trillion in within 12 years, Treasury Secretary
 Timothy F. Geithner  said.  Federal Reserve  Bank of Richmond
President Jeffrey Lacker said the central bank should end its
stimulus programs before inflation picks up, closing another
source of support for the economy.  “Treasuries are undervalued,” said Hiromasa Nakamura, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $41.9 billion as senior investor
in Tokyo at Mizuho Asset Management Co., a unit of Japan’s
second-largest bank. “Housing and employment are fragile.”  Ten-year yields fell two basis points to 3.48 percent as of
1:46 p.m. in Tokyo, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The 3.625 percent note maturing in February 2021 rose 1/8, or
$1.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 101 5/32. Yields have fallen 10
basis points this week, poised for the first five-day decline
since the period ended March 18.  Obama said yesterday he wants to move quickly on cutting
the deficit. “We can’t exempt anybody,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
