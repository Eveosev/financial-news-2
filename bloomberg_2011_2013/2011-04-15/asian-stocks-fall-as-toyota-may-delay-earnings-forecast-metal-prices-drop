Asian stocks fell, dragging the
regional index toward its first loss in four weeks, after  China 
reported that inflation in the world’s second-largest economy
increased faster than estimated, increasing speculation that the
government will need to do more to contain growth.  China Resources Land Ltd. (1109) , a state-controlled developer,
slid 2 percent in  Hong Kong .  Belle International Holdings Ltd. (1880) ,
China’s largest retailer of women’s shoes, sank 1 percent.  Fanuc
Corp. (6954) , the robot maker which counts Asia including China as its
biggest market for sales, dropped 1.1 percent.  Infosys
Technologies Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-largest software exporter,
tumbled 9.6 percent in Mumbai after posting profit that missed
estimates.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the No. 1 mining company, slid 1
percent after metal prices declined for a fourth day.  “China’s economic growth remains robust,” said Benjamin Tam, a portfolio manager at IG Investment Ltd., which oversees
about $1.98 billion. “The government may continue to step up
tightening measures in the second quarter. The overall market
will remain optimistic because of the stronger growth, but there
could be some concerns on the rate hike.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.5 percent to 135.75 as
of 8:17 p.m. in Tokyo. About twice as many shares declined as
advanced. The measure is headed for a 0.6 percent decline this
week, after rising for the past three weeks as Japanese
companies resumed production after last month’s earthquake, and
as an improving U.S. economy bolstered optimism the global
recovery can be sustained.  Benchmark Indices  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.1
percent today. In  New York , the index rose less than 0.1 percent
yesterday, as the U.S. House of Representatives approved a
spending bill to avert a government shutdown.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average fell 0.7 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index fell 0.7 percent and New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index slipped 0.1 percent. South Korea’s Kospi index was
little changed.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
1.6 percent after the commerce ministry said wholesale inflation
rose 8.98 percent in March from a year earlier, more than
estimated.  Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index was little changed after rising
0.9 percent and falling 0.5 percent. China’s Shanghai Stock
Exchange Composite Index climbed 0.3 percent, erasing a loss of
0.7 percent. The central bank has raised the reserve-requirement
ratio for lenders nine times since the start of 2010 and
borrowing costs four times.  China Economy  Belle International fell 1 percent to HK$15.48, posting the
second-biggest drop on the  Hang Seng index. (HSI)  China Resources Land,
a state-controlled developer, fell 2 percent to HK$14.60.  Fanuc, Japan’s No. 1 maker of industrial robots, slipped
1.1 percent to 13,150 yen in Tokyo, the heaviest drag on the
Nikkei 225.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a machinery maker which counts China
as its biggest market, fell 1.5 percent to 2,785 yen.  China’s economy  grew a more-than-estimated 9.7 percent in
the first quarter and the rate of inflation accelerated to 5.4
percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace since
2008. That exceeded the estimate of a 9.4 percent increase in
gross domestic product and price increases at a rate of 5.2
percent, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 25 economists. That compared with 4.9 percent
inflation in January and February.  The Biggest Concern  “Inflation is still the biggest concern and it looks like
it will be at a high level throughout the year,” said Dai Ming,
a fund manager at Shanghai Kingsun Investment Management &
Consulting Co.  The MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index lost 0.9 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with gains of 4.5 percent by the  S&P
500  and 0.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.5 times for the S&P 500 and 11.2 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Infosys Technologies tumbled 9.6 percent to 2,989.5 rupees
in Mumbai, the steepest decline since May 2009. It was the
biggest drag on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.  Net income rose to 18.2 billion rupees ($410 million) in
the three months ended March 31 from 16 billion rupees a year
earlier, Bangalore-based Infosys said today. That compared with
the 18.9 billion rupee average of 27 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  BHP fell 1 percent to A$47.53, the second-biggest drag on
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s
second-largest mining company by sales, dropped 1.1 percent to
A$84.15.  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) , Japan’s largest commodities trader,
dropped 2 percent to 2,187 yen.  The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including aluminum fell 0.8 percent yesterday,
its fourth straight day of declines. Copper rebounded today from
its longest slump in three months.  Newcrest Mining Ltd. (NCM) , Australia’s biggest gold producer,
advanced 1.5 percent to A$41.30, the biggest support on the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index. Gold climbed to a record as concern about
rising inflation and an extended decline in the  U.S. dollar 
bolstered the allure of precious metals as a store of value.  To contact the reporters on this story:
