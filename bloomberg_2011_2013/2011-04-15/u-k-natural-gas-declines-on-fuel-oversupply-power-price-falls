U.K. natural gas declined as demand
for fuel to pump into storage fell and the grid manager
predicted an oversupply. Power prices also dropped.  National Grid Plc forecast gas demand at 276 million cubic
meters in the 24 hours through 6 a.m.  London  time tomorrow,
about 4 million less than earlier predictions. The nation’s
pipelines will hold 350 million cubic meters of the fuel at that
time, 11 million more than at the start of today.  “Demand dipped significantly, attributed to lower
aggregated storage injection nominations and industrial
demand,” Nick Campbell, an analyst at Lytham St. Annes,
England-based Inenco Group Ltd., said in an e-mail.  Same-day gas lost 1.3 pence, or 2.2 percent, to 59.3 pence
a therm as of 5:55 p.m. in London, according to broker prices
compiled by Bloomberg. That’s equal to $9.67 a million British
thermal units. A therm is 100,000 Btu.  About half of Britain’s power stations can be fueled from
natural gas so the price influences power markets. Baseload
power for the next working day lost 90 pence to 51.10 pounds a
megawatt-hour, broker data show.  Gas for next month recovered from earlier losses to rise
0.4 percent to 59.55 pence a therm. The equivalent power
contract increased 0.6 percent to 52 pounds a megawatt-hour.

Group Inc. and Spectron Group Ltd.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
