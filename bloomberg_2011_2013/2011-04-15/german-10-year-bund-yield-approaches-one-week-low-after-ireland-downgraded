German 10-year government bond
yields approached the lowest in a week after Moody’s Investors
Service downgraded Ireland’s credit rating.  The nation’s two-year notes were little changed before a
report that is forecast to show inflation in the 17-nation euro
region quickened to 2.6 percent in March, from 2.4 percent in
February. That would be the fastest in more than two years. The
MSCI AC Asia Pacific Index dropped 0.6 percent.  The yield on the benchmark 10-year bund was less than one
basis point lower at 3.42 percent as of 7:49 a.m. in  London . It
yesterday reached a one-week low of 3.38 percent, the least
since April 5. The two-year note yield was at 1.86 percent.  Moody’s downgraded Ireland’s foreign- and local-currency
government bond ratings by two levels to Baa3, the lowest
investment grade, from Baa1. The outlook on the ratings remains
negative.  To contact the reporter on this story:
