Corn fell, capping the first weekly
loss in a month, on speculation that rising supplies in  South
America  may erode demand for crops from the U.S., the world’s
biggest exporter. Soybeans rose.  Argentina  will harvest 20 million metric tons of corn this
year, up from 19.5 million tons estimated last month, the Buenos
Aires Cereals Exchange said yesterday. Ukraine may double grain
exports in the year that begins July 1, UkrAgroConsult said.
Cheaper feed-grade wheat may cut corn demand.  “The markets are adjusting to the prospect for larger
supplies,” said Chad Henderson, an analyst at Prime
Agricultural Consultants Inc. in Brookfield, Wisconsin. “Wheat
is going to work into more livestock-feed rations.”  Corn futures for July delivery fell 11.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to close at $7.495 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago
Board of Trade. This week, the price dropped 3.2 percent,
snapping a four-week rally. On April 11, the commodity reached
$7.8875, the highest since June 2008.  Grain demand may ebb in  China  if the government continues
to raise  interest rates  to stem inflation, said Brian Grete, a
senior market analyst at the Professional Farmers of America
newsletter in  Cedar Falls ,  Iowa .  “The threat of higher interest rates in China is negative
for the agriculture markets,” he said.  China is the biggest buyer of soybeans and the largest
producer of pork. The U.S. is the leading exporter of the
oilseed.  Soybean futures for May delivery gained 0.5 cent to
$13.4325 a bushel. This week, the price dropped 4.3 percent, the
most since mid-March.  In the past 12 months, corn futures have doubled, wheat has
gained 58 percent and soybeans are up 35 percent.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
