Oil options volatility slipped as
the underlying front-month futures increased for a third day as
better-than-forecast U.S. consumer confidence and industrial
data bolstered optimism in the economy.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.8 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 29 percent yesterday.  Oil for May delivery gained $1.55, or 1.4 percent, to
settle at $109.66 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Prices are up 28 percent from a year ago. June futures, which
become the front month after the May contract expires April 19,
rose $1.52, or 1.4 percent, to $110.22.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
$130 calls with 2,075 lots changing hands. They were unchanged
from the day before at 25 cents a barrel. July $120 calls, the
next-most active contract, rose 16 cents to $2.25 a barrel with
1,787 contracts trading.  One contract is for 1,000 barrels of oil. May options
expired at the close of floor trading yesterday.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $120 calls were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 5,880 lots changing hands. They were
unchanged from the day before at 81 cents a barrel. The next
most active option, July $95 puts, lost 17 cents to 98 cents a
barrel on 4,760 lots.  Open interest was highest for June $150 calls with 43,799
contracts. Next were December 2012 $80 puts with 40,312 and
December $120 calls with 38,706.  To contact the reporter on this story:
