The Philippine peso had its biggest
weekly decline in five on concern a slowdown in  Japan ’s economy
will crimp growth in the nation’s exports to its biggest
overseas market.  Shipments from the  Philippines  increased 8.2 percent in
February from a year earlier, the least in 15 months, the
 National Statistics Office  reported on April 12. The currency
traded near a one-week low after the Japanese government cut its
assessment of the economy for the first time in six months on
April 13, reflecting damage caused by a record earthquake last
month.  “Japan being the major trading partner of the Philippines,
there will be some slowdown in exports,” said Roland Avante, a
treasurer at Sterling Bank of  Asia  in Manila. “The peso looks
stable.”  The peso dropped 0.6 percent this week to 43.24 per dollar
as of 4:15 p.m. in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. It
was little changed today. The currency reached 43.41 yesterday,
the weakest level since April 5.  Overseas shipments account for about a third of the
nation’s gross domestic product, with Japan buying about 15
percent of Philippine exports, according to official data.  Five-year peso bonds gained this week, with the yield on
the 7 percent note due January 2016 dropping 30 basis points, or
0.30 percentage point, to 5.025 percent. The rate fell 15 basis
points today.  To contact the reporter for this story:
