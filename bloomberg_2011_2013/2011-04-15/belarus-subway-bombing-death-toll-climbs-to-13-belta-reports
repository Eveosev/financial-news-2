The death toll from this week’s
subway bombing in Minsk has risen to 13 when a victim died in
hospital, the state-run news service Belta reported today,
citing the Health Ministry.  An explosive device went off during the evening rush hour
on April 11, also wounding more than 190 people at the capital
Minsk’s busiest metro station, near the presidential residence.  Authorities have detained five people in connection with
the explosion, Oleg Voronin, a prosecution official, said today,
according to Belta. The case was "solved" after three suspects
arrested the day after the bombing confessed, Belarusian
President Aleksandr Lukashenko said on April 13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
