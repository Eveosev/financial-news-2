Taiwan ’s dollar had its first
weekly decline since March 19 after foreign funds sold local
equities and on speculation the central bank may intervene to
limit gains in the currency.  Overseas investors sold $300 million more Taiwanese
equities than they bought this week, according to exchange data.
The local dollar is  Asia ’s best-performing major currency in the
past six months, rallying 5.5 percent.  “In the Taiwan dollar’s case, it’s more a function of
equity flows at the moment,” said Wai Ho Leong, an economist in
 Singapore  at Barclays Plc. “The central bank is also holding it
at NT$29.”  Taiwan’s dollar dropped 0.2 percent this week to NT$29.050
against its U.S. counterpart at the 4 p.m. close local time,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. The currency was little changed
today.  Central banks intervene in  currency markets  by arranging
purchases or sales of foreign exchange.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent bond due March 2021 was
little changed at 1.36 percent, according to Gretai Securities
Market, the island’s biggest exchange for bonds. The rate rose
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, this week.  To contact the reporters on this story:
