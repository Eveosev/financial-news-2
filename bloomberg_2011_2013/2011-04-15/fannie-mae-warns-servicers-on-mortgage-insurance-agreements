Fannie Mae , the government-owned
finance company, told mortgage servicers to halt a practice that
could help them avoid repurchasing flawed home loans.  In a  notice  to banks today, the company said servicers are
prohibited from entering into loss-sharing or indemnification
agreements with mortgage insurers. The deals help servicers
avoid having their policies revoked.  The arrangements “compromise mortgage insurance coverage”
and are “generally inconsistent with protecting Fannie Mae’s
interests in mortgage loans,” the Washington-based company said
in its notice. Fannie Mae’s smaller rival,  Freddie Mac  of
McLean,  Virginia , sent a similar warning on April 1.  Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are operating under
federal conservatorship, rely on mortgage insurers to help
ferret out bad loans. When an insurer rescinds a policy, it
triggers a loan-repurchase request to the lender from the
government-sponsored enterprises.  Companies including Milwaukee-based  MGIC Investment Corp. (MTG) 
sell insurance on home loans, paying lenders if the loans go
into default. After three straight years of losses, the $759
billion industry has been investigating more loans for flaws
that might allow them to revoke policies.  MGIC said last year it had settled with a lender to halt
rescissions in return for a payment.  Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, which own or guarantee more
than half of all U.S. home loans, require lenders to buy
insurance on mortgages that have small borrower down payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
