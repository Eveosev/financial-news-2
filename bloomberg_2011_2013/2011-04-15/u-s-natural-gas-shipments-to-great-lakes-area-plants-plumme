Scheduled natural gas deliveries to
U.S. power generators fell for the second day in three as
shipments to an area stretching from the  Great Lakes  to the mid-
Atlantic region fell on forecasts of moderating temperatures.  Shipments to electricity producers from Michigan to
Maryland dropped 44 percent to 697,195 dekatherms (680,000 cubic
feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as of 9:30 a.m.
in New York. A sample of scheduled deliveries to power plants in
the U.S. and Canada shows shipments declined 7.2 percent to 12.7
million dekatherms.  Scheduled shipments for U.S. residences fell 1.4 percent to
27.7 million, the second consecutive daily decline.  High temperatures in Cincinnati today are expected to hit
67 degrees Fahrenheit (19 Celsius), 1 below normal, according to
 Weather Underground  in Ann Arbor, Michigan. They may rise to 72
degrees by April 19, the forecaster said.  Wholesale gas at the Columbia TCO Pool, where gas is
delivered from  Texas  to the Northeast, fell 3.82 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $4.2838 per million British thermal units yesterday
on the Intercontinental Exchange.  Gas at the  Henry Hub  in Erath, Louisiana, the delivery
point for futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
dropped 1.66 cents yesterday, or 0.4 percent, to $4.1251 per
million Btu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
