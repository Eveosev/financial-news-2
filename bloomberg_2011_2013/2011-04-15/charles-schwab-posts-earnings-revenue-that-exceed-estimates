Charles Schwab Corp. (SCHW) , the largest
independent brokerage by client assets, reported first-quarter
earnings and sales that exceeded the average analyst estimate,
boosted by interest revenue and higher fees for managing assets.  Net income climbed to $243 million from $6 million in the
year-earlier period, the San Francisco-based company said in a
statement today. Last year, Schwab had $196 million in
litigation expenses for a settlement related to its YieldPlus
mutual fund. Adjusted earnings were 20 cents a share, compared
with the average analyst forecast of 19 cents a share according
to a Bloomberg survey.  Asset-management fees climbed 20 percent to $502 million,
while revenue earned from interest was up 28 percent from the
year-ago period, according to the statement. Revenue rose 23
percent to $1.21 billion, compared with the average analyst
projection for $1.18 billion, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The shares rose 2.1 percent to $18.60 at 9:45 a.m.  New York 
time. Before today, the year-to-date advance was 6.5 percent,
compared with a 4.5 percent gain in the  S&P 500  and a 2.1
percent decline for the NYSE Arca Securities Broker/Dealer
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
