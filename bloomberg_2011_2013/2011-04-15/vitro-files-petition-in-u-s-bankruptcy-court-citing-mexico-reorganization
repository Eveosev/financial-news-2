Vitro SAB, the Mexican glassmaker
that defaulted in 2009, filed a petition for recognition of its
Mexican reorganization in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in  Manhattan .  The company has more than $1 billion in assets and
liabilities, according to yesterday’s filing. Four affiliates
have pending bankruptcy cases in  Fort Worth , Texas, according to
the filing. The Chapter 15 petition seeks to block any creditor
suits in the U.S. pending the reorganization in Mexico.  The company had filed a Chapter 15 petition last year that
was withdrawn when its reorganization was dismissed.  On April 12, an appellate court in Mexico reinstated the
reorganization the company filed last year under that country’s
concurso mercantile, the Mexican equivalent of a prepackaged
Chapter 11 reorganization.  In the now-revived Mexican reorganization, Vitro was
offering noteholders what it said would be a recovery of as much
as 73 percent by exchanging existing debt for cash, new debt and
convertible bonds.  The case is In Re Vitro SAB de DV, 11-11754,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
