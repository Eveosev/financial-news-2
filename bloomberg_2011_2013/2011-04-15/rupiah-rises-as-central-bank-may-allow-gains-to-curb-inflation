Indonesia’s rupiah gained the most
in almost two weeks on speculation the  central bank  will
tolerate gains to tackle rising prices.  The rupiah, which has strengthened 3.5 percent this year,
is likely to appreciate further in 2011, Bank Indonesia Governor
Darmin Nasution said April 12. The  Singapore dollar  climbed to a
record after the central bank yesterday revalued the currency’s
trading range to curb inflation.  “The central bank has been open in saying that they will
use a stronger currency to fight inflation,” said  Gundy
Cahyadi , an economist at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. in
 Singapore . “The underlying sentiment is still for a stronger
rupiah.”  The rupiah strengthened 0.3 percent to 8,668 per dollar as
of 4:37 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 8,637 on April 11, strongest level in
seven years. The currency dropped 0.2 percent this week, the
first decline since the five days ended March 11.  Ten-year  government bonds  fell. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 climbed 15 basis points to 7.78
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. The rate slipped two basis points this week.  China ’s government today reported inflation accelerated to
5.4 percent last month, the fastest pace since 2008, while
India’s wholesale price index climbed 8.98 percent. The Monetary
Authority of Singapore said yesterday it will allow its currency
to appreciate further.  “It was seen as a signal that the inflation story is still
in the picture for Asia,” Cahyadi said. “That boosted
sentiment that other Asian central banks will do more to combat
inflation.”  Indonesia kept its benchmark lending rate unchanged at 6.75
percent on April 12. Policy makers raised borrowing costs by 25
basis points in February, the first increase since 2008.  Core inflation , which excludes food and fuel, gained 4.45
percent in March from a year earlier, compared with an increase
of 4.36 percent in February, according to government data
released on April 1. That was the fastest since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
