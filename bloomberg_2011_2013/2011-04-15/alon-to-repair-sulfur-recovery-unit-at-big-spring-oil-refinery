Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  will carry out
maintenance on a sulfur recovery unit at its Big Spring refinery
in  Texas  that may lead to flaring, or the release of gases into
the air, according to a filing with state regulators.  The company will change the amine on the number 2 SRU,
according to the  filing  with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. The work, which will start at 7 a.m.
local time today and last six hours, may lead to about 2,064
pounds of sulfur dioxide being released into the air.  The refinery can process 70,000 barrels of oil a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Flaring is a safety
measure to prevent excessive pressure from building up. Amine is
used to remove hydrogen sulfide from emissions before being
processed in the SRU.  To contact the reporter on this story:
