Gold climbed to a record as concern
about rising inflation and an extended decline in the dollar
bolstered the allure of precious metals as a store of value.
Silver reached a 31-year peak.  Immediate-delivery bullion advanced as much as 0.3 percent
to a record $1,478.32 an ounce before trading at $1,477.40 an
ounce at 7:30 a.m. in Singapore. Bullion for June delivery in
New York also leapt to an all-time high of $1,479.90 an ounce,
gaining as much as 0.5 percent.  “Commodities, including gold, will continue to be the
focus of investors,” said  Gavin Wendt , an analyst with MineLife
Pty. “There’s no compelling reason to own the U.S. dollar and I
see little significant recovery ahead for the currency.”  The dollar touched a 16-month low against six major
currencies on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will lag behind
the  European Central Bank  in raising  interest rates . Data today
may show European and Chinese inflation quickened last month.
Concerns about Japan’s nuclear disaster, fighting in Libya and
European debt helped gold reach a record.  Gold is headed for its second weekly advance, taking gains
in the past year to 27 percent. Fourteen of 18 traders,
investors and analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, or 78 percent,
said bullion will rise next week. Three predicted lower prices
and one was neutral.  Cash silver climbed as much as 0.6 percent to $42.4225 an
ounce today, the highest since 1980, before trading at $42.2337
an ounce and extending a 3.8 percent rally yesterday. Spot
palladium and platinum were little changed at $778 an ounce and
$1,795 an ounce, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story;
