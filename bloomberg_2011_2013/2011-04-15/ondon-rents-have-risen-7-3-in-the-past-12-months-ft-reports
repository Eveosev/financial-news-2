Rents in  London  have risen 7.3
percent in the past 12 months, boosted by demand from people who
would like to buy homes but are struggling to raise deposits for
mortgages, the Financial Times reported, citing a buy-to-let
index produced by LSL Property Services Plc.  If the trend continues, tenants in the U.K. capital could
be paying more than 1,000 pounds a month ($1,630) on average by
next year, the newspaper said, adding that the average rent in
England and  Wales  has risen by 4.2 percent in the past year.  David Newnes, LSLâ€™s managing director, said demand
continues to outstrip supply and rents are consequently rising
faster than prices and much faster than pay, the FT reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
