John Buchanan, who coached
 Australia  to two World Cup titles and a record 16 straight Test
victories, was hired as  New Zealand ’s director of cricket.  Buchanan, 58, will start in the new role next month and
oversee a high-performance program, talent identification and
the national team selection panel, New Zealand Cricket said in a
statement.  “John’s appointment is an exciting one for New Zealand
Cricket,” Justin Vaughan, the Christchurch-based governing
body’s chief executive officer, said in the statement. “He has
a great cricketing pedigree and will provide outstanding
leadership as New Zealand Cricket look to move forward.”  Buchanan helped Australia become one of the most dominant
teams in the sport’s history during an eight-year tenure that
ended in 2007. The Australians won three-quarters of their Test
matches and one-day internationals under the former university
lecturer, including a record 21 consecutive one-day victories.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
