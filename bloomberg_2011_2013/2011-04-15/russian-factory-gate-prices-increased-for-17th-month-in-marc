Russian producer prices, an early
indicator of inflation, rose in March slower than economists
predicted, led by the mining sector and manufacturers.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines jumped an
annual 20.9 percent, growing for a 17th consecutive month, after
a 21.4 percent advance a month earlier, the  Federal Statistics
Service  in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement today. The
median forecast of nine economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
an increase of 22.6 percent.  Factory-gate prices climbed 1.3 percent in March from the
previous month after a 3.3 percent monthly rise in February, the
service said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
