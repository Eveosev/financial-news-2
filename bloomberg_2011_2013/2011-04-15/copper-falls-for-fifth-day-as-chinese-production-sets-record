Copper fell for a fifth day in  New
York  after Chinese production of the metal climbed to a record
amid concern the government will tighten credit, slowing growth
and curbing commodity demand.  Refined output in China, the world’s biggest consumer, rose
24 percent from a year earlier to 470,000 metric tons in March,
the statistics bureau said. That’s a monthly record, according
to Minmetals Starfutures Co. The country’s economy expanded by a
more-than forecast 9.7 percent in the first quarter, and
inflation accelerated in March to the fastest pace since 2008,
adding pressure for more monetary tightening.  “Record copper output in China” weighed on sentiment,
 John Meyer , an analyst at Fairfax IS in  London , said today in a
report. The economic data “demonstrates  China ’s continuing
drive for growth, and that measures to slow inflation have not
yet had severe impact.”  Copper futures for July delivery slid 2.25 cents, or 0.5
percent, to $4.281 a pound at 11:13 a.m. on the Comex in New
York. A close at that price would leave the contract down 5.3
percent for the week.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery dropped $22.50, or 0.2 percent, to $9,387.50 a ton
($4.26 a pound).  Inventories tracked by the LME increased 1.4 percent this
week, the ninth gain in 10 weeks. Stockpiles are up 29 percent
from the 2010 low on Dec. 10. Nissan Motor Co., Japan’s second-
largest carmaker, may delay reopening an engine plant damaged by
the March 11 earthquake after several aftershocks.  “The market had a substantial selloff this week” amid
rising LME supplies and a slowdown in the Japanese  auto
industry , said Rich Ilczyszyn, a senior strategist at Lind-
Waldock, a broker in  Chicago . “We need a catalyst for copper to
take off.”  Also in London, aluminum, lead, nickel and tin gained. Zinc
was little changed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
