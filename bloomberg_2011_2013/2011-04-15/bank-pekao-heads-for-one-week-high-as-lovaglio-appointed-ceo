Bank Pekao SA (PEO) , Poland’s second-
largest lender, rose to a one-week high in Warsaw trading after
Luigi Lovaglio was appointed chief executive officer, replacing
Alicja Kornasiewicz.  The unit of  UniCredit SpA (UCG)  gained as much as 1.2 percent to
179 zloty, the highest intraday level in a week. Kornasiewicz
resigned and may be appointed to the Warsaw-based bank’s
supervisory board later this month, Pekao said in regulatory
statements yesterday.  “Lovaglio has been known for many years as the power
behind the throne, who ran the bank’s operations,” Marcin Materna, an analyst at Bank Millennium SA, said by phone. “Now
there will be a single person in charge.”  Lovaglio started working for UniCredit in 1973, joining
Pekao’s management board 30 years later. He supervised the
takeover and integration of Bank BPH SA, then the country’s
third-largest lender. Pekao’s profit almost tripled to 2.53
billion zloty ($930 million) last year from 920 million zloty in
2003, when Lovaglio became deputy CEO.  Pekao shares have added 2.5 percent so far this year,
valuing the bank at 46.8 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
