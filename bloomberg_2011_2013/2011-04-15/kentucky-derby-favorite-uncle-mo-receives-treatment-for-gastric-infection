Uncle Mo is being treated for a
gastrointestinal tract infection three weeks before the colt is
set to run as the favorite in the 2011  Kentucky Derby , trainer
 Todd Pletcher  said.  The 3-year-old reigning juvenile champion underwent medical
tests after “an uncharacteristically poor effort” in last
weekend’s Wood Memorial Stakes at Aqueduct Racetrack in  Jamaica ,
 New York , Pletcher said. Uncle Mo, owned by Mike Repole, came in
third for his first defeat in five starts.  “If I do not feel that Uncle Mo is 100 percent for the
Kentucky Derby, both Mike and I agree that he will not run,”
Pletcher said yesterday in an e-mail. “My main focus is to
return Uncle Mo to optimum health in the next 23 days, and I am
optimistic that we can accomplish this goal.”  Uncle Mo will travel on April 18 to Churchill Downs in
Louisville,  Kentucky , where he will return to full training with
two workouts before the May 7 Derby, the trainer said.  Uncle Mo won the $100,000 Timely Writer Stakes in his debut
as a 3-year-old on March 12, his first race since he won the $2
million Breeders’ Cup Juvenile at Churchill Downs on Nov. 6.  Repole, Uncle Mo’s owner, is co-founder of Glaceau
Vitaminwater sports drink, which was sold to Coca Cola Co. for
$4.1 billion in 2007.  “Though it has been a lifelong dream to run and win the
Kentucky Derby, if Uncle Mo is not 100 percent, we will skip the
Derby and go right to the Preakness,” Repole said in an e-mail.  In addition to Uncle Mo, Repole owns Derby contender Stay
Thirsty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
