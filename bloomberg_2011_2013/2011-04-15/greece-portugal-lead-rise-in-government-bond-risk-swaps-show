Greece  and  Portugal  led an increase
in the cost of insuring government debt, according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  Contracts on Greece jumped 17 basis points to a record
1,113 basis points and Portugal climbed 9.5 to an all-time high
of 600.5, according to CMA. That helped push the Markit iTraxx
SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15 governments 3 basis
points higher to 175, the highest in three weeks.  Contracts on Ireland increased 9 basis points to 557, Italy
rose 2 to 143 and  Spain  was 5 higher at 234, CMA prices show. An
increase signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers was unchanged at 128 basis points, and
the subordinated index fell 4 to 224, according to JPMorgan
Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 1 basis point to 367 and
the Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with investment-
grade ratings rose 0.5 to 97, JPMorgan prices show.  A basis point on a credit-default swap contract protecting
10 million euros ($14.5 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
