Austria’s financial supervisor FMA
doesn’t see “big problems” for the nation’s lenders in the
Europe bank stress tests.  “We don’t anticipate that we will have big problems in the
stress test,” Austrian Financial Market Authority Co-Chairman
Helmut Ettl told reporters at a briefing in Vienna yesterday.  Erste Group Bank AG (EBS) ,  Raiffeisen Bank International AG (RBI)  and
 Oesterreichische Volksbanken AG (VBPS)  are the three Austrian banks
among the 90 lenders in this year’s stress tests. Banks will be
expected to maintain a Core Tier 1 capital ratio of at least 5
percent under the stress-test scenarios, the European Banking
Authority said on April 8.  Erste and Raiffeisen both participated and passed last
year’s stress test. Volksbanken wasn’t included in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
