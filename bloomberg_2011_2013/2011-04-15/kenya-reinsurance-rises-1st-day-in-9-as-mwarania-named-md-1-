Kenya Reinsurance Corp., a state-
owned reinsurer, rose for the first day in nine after naming
Jadiah Mwarania as its managing director.  The shares advanced 1 percent to close trading at 9.8
shillings by 3 p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, paring its decline
this year to 11 percent.  The appointment of Mwarania, who was acting MD, was made
effective April 12, the company said in a statement to the
Nairobi-based stock exchange today.  “It brings in some element of certainty, which is quite
good for the market,” Eric Musau, an analyst at Nairobi-based
African Alliance Securities Kenya Ltd., said by phone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
