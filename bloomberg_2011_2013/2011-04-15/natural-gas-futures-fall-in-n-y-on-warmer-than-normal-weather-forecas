Natural gas futures fell in  New
York  as forecasts showed warmer-than-normal weather in the last
week of April, reducing demand for the heating fuel.  Gas slipped as much as 0.9 percent as forecasters including
Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland , said in the
11- to 15-day outlook that the eastern U.S. will probably be
warmer than normal.  “The weather is not supporting the market,” said Carl Neill, an energy consultant at Risk Management Inc. in Atlanta.
“In the short term, before the hurricane season starts, it
probably will be a pretty bearish market.”  Natural gas for May delivery dropped 3.4 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $4.178 per million British thermal units at 9:07
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The futures have
gained 3.4 percent this week and are down 5.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
