The  Boston Red Sox  and three-time
All-Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez agreed today on a seven-
year contract extension, the team announced on its website.  Gonzalez, who was acquired during the offseason from the
San Diego Padres, is signed through the 2018 season, General
Manager Theo Epstein said.  Financial terms of the contract weren’t disclosed in the
 release . Comcast SportsNet New England reported today that the
deal was worth $154 million.  Gonzalez, an All-Star each of the past three years, has
started all eleven games for the Red Sox this season, hitting
.268 with one home run and seven runs batted in. In an eight-
year career with three teams, the 28-year-old Gonzalez has a
.284 batting average with 169 homers and 532 RBI.  By waiting until after the beginning of the Major League
Baseball season, the  Red Sox  were able to use Gonzalez’s $6.5
million salary against the luxury-tax threshold, rather than the
new salary figure, according to Comcast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
