The Board of Governors of the
 Federal Reserve System  and two U.S. state regulators said they
have issued a cease and desist order and $1.8 million in fines
against Caracas-based Banco Industrial de Venezuela CA and its
agencies in New York and Miami.  The order “is designed to address deficiencies revealed in
repeated examinations of the agencies by the  Federal Reserve ”
and two state supervisors, the Florida Office of Financial
Regulation and the New York State Banking Department, according
to a statement today. “The order also addresses issues relating
to BIV’s financial condition and the lack of audited financial
statements.”  The order restricts the bank’s U.S. entities from making
new loans or taking on new customers without the approval of its
U.S. banking supervisors, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
