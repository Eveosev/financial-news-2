Group of 20 countries have been
slow to strengthen regulations for over-the-counter derivative
markets and many jurisdictions need to take immediate steps to
avoid missing the 2012 deadline they agreed to, the  Financial
Stability Board  said.  Many countries have also started to take differing
approaches to rules that could weaken their effectiveness, the
FSB said in a report released by the Basel-based organization
today.  “Many jurisdictions may not meet the end-2012 deadline,”
the report said. “For this target to be achieved, jurisdictions
need to take substantial, concrete steps toward implementation
immediately.”  G-20 nations have sought to tighten rules on over-the-
counter derivatives, including credit-default swaps, saying
their trading helped fuel the financial crisis. Establishing
clearinghouses and transparent trading systems are the main
components of the new rules. The U.S. and 27-nation European
Union have proposed limits on derivative trading risks.  Countries are taking different steps “that could weaken
the effectiveness of reforms,” the report said, which could
“create potential opportunities for regulatory arbitrage.”  The FSB said it would continue to monitor progress and
publish another report by October.  The FSB brings together regulators and finance ministry
officials from the Group of 20 countries, as well as standard-
setting bodies such as the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision .  To contact the reporter on this story:
