     April 15 (Bloomberg)-- A ruling party lawmaker from
Fukushima prefecture called for Prime Minister  Naoto Kan ’s
resignation, Jiji Press  reported , as a crippled nuclear power
plant continues to leak radiation after last month’s earthquake
and tsunami.  Yozaburo Ishihara , 38, a first-term lawmaker, said Kan
should “resign immediately” so that a new administration can
work to contain the situation, Jiji said, citing remarks made at
a meeting of Democratic Party of Japan lawmakers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
