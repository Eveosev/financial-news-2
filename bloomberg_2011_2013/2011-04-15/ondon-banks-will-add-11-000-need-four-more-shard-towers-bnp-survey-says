Banks and financial-services
companies in London will add 11,000 employees in the next three
years and will require the equivalent of four Shard skyscrapers
to accommodate them,  BNP Paribas (BNP)  SA’s real estate unit said.  Banks will need 1.6 million square feet, with the  City of
London  district and Mayfair areas most likely to benefit,
according to the report. The 1,016-foot (310-meter)  Shard  will
be Britain’s tallest building when completed.  “Financial-sector demand will be there, the occupiers will
pay the rents,” BNP Paribas said in the report. “Occupiers
will push hard for lease flexibility.”  About 75 percent of financial companies said business would
expand over the next three years, and 55 percent said they would
employ add employees, the study said. The strongest growth is
expected by smaller financial companies while the biggest banks
are expecting to expand more slowly, the report said.  Transport links are the most important consideration in
influencing decisions about the location for new office space,
followed by lease flexibility, rent level and workforce
availability, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
