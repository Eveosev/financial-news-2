Ivory Coast incumbent President  Laurent Gbagbo  ordered the seizure of “some” of the banks that
closed this week in the West African country, including units of  BNP Paribas  SA and  Societe Generale  SA, according to a statement
read out on state-owned television today.  Gbagbo “took some decrees so as the state of Ivory Coast
takes a total and complete control in the capital of some of
these banks,” Ahoua Don Mello, a spokesman for the government,
said.  The measures concern, “among others, the BICICI and the
SGBCI,” the local branches of the French banks, BNP Paribas and
Societe Generale, he said, without identifying other banks.  The decision is meant to “preserve the jobs, and make sure
the Ivoirians and the economic actors have access to their
assets,” he added.  At least five banks closed this week because of security
concerns after a disputed Nov. 28 vote left the country with two
rival administrations.  Gbagbo has ruled the country for a decade and refuses to
give up power to  Alassane Ouattara , the internationally
recognized winner of the elections.  Ouattara has remained in a hotel in Abidjan, protected by
United Nations peacekeepers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
