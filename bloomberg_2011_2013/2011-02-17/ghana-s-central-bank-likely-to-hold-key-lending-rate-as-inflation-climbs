Ghana’s  central bank may leave its
benchmark lending rate unchanged for the third consecutive
meeting after inflation climbed for the first time in 19 months.  Six of the seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg expect the  Bank of Ghana  to maintain its policy rate at 13.5 percent. One
person expected it to be either maintained or increased, without
giving a specific figure. The bank reduced the rate by 1.5
percentage points in July and left it unchanged on Sept. 24 and
Dec. 10. The decision will be announced at 11 a.m. tomorrow in
the capital, Accra.  “Although inflation has turned, we still see it within a
fairly narrow 300 basis-points range around the current print,”
said  Razia Khan , London-based head of Africa research at
Standard Chartered Plc, in an e-mailed note Feb 15.  Inflation accelerated to 9.1 percent in January from 8.6
percent the month before, as gasoline prices jumped 30 percent,
the  Ghana  Statistical Service said on Feb. 9. The central bank
lowered its key rate four times between November 2009 and July
last year as inflation slowed from a five-year high of 20.7
percent in June 2009. Stability in the local currency, the cedi,
helped cut the cost of imports and ease pressure on prices.  The central bank may need to keep borrowing costs in check
amid plans by the West African nation to “pay down arrears,”
Stephen Bailey-Smith, an emerging-markets strategist at Standard
Bank Plc in  London , said in an e-mailed note on Feb. 15.  Ghana paid 626.5 million cedis ($415 million) in debt in
2009 and 246 million cedis in 2010, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor  said in a  2011 budget statement  on Nov. 18. Proceeds of
yesterday’s central bank bond auction of 400 million cedis will
be used to pay off more arrears, Francis Andoh, head of the
treasury department said Feb. 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
