Gold investment in  China  jumped 70
percent last year and consumption by the jewelery sector gained
to a record as investors stepped up purchases of the precious
metal as a store of value, said the World Gold Council.  Investment demand jumped to 179.9 metric tons last year,
surpassing  Germany  and the U.S., as buyers sought out gold bars
and coins, according the London-based industry group. Demand
from the jewelry sector was 400 tons, it said.  Gold reached a record $1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7 and
soared nearly 30 percent last year as the dollar dropped and
investors sought a store of value amid currency debasement.
China’s consumer prices increased 4.9 percent in January from a
year earlier, exceeding policy makers 4 percent inflation
ceiling for a fourth month, data showed this week.  “The main motivation behind this demand has been concern
over domestic inflation pressure and poor performance of
alternative investments, combined with expectations of further
gold price gains,” the council’s report said.  Bullion gained 0.3 percent to $1,379.50 at 3:34 p.m. in  Shanghai .  Consumption in China, the second-largest buyer, may gain 15
percent in the first half, fueled by growing demand for
alternative investments and a hedge against inflation, the China
Gold Association’s deputy chairman Zhang Bingnan said last
month.  China displaced  South Africa  as the world’s biggest gold
producer in 2007. Imports through October rose almost fivefold
from the total shipped in the previous year to 209 tons,
according to the Shanghai Gold Exchange. Mine output reached a
record 340 tons last year, the China Gold Association said.  The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd, the
world’s biggest lender by market value, started physical-gold
linked  savings accounts  in December in an initiative with the
World Gold Council. Account openings surpassed 1 million with
over 12 tons of gold stored on behalf of investors, it has said.  --Feiwen Rong. Editors: Bloomberg News, Jarrett Banks  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
