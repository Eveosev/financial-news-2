Ukraine plans to extend grain export
quotas through the end of the season, or June 30, to stabilize
domestic prices for grains and flour, the Agriculture Ministry
said.  “Agriculture Minister Mykola Prysyazhnyuk has made a clear
statement that the quotas will be extended through the end of
the marketing year,” said Anatoliy Rozgon, head of the
agriculture-markets department, according to a statement
published yesterday on the ministry’s website.  Ukraine imposed grain export limits last year, putting the
caps for wheat, barley and corn at 4.2 million tons, through the
end of March. The country harvested 39.2 million tons of grain
in 2010, according to statistics data. The government estimates
domestic grain needs at 26 million tons.  Ukraine can export as much as 1 million tons of milling
wheat by June 30, according to Deputy Agriculture Minister
Serhiy Trehubenko. The country on June 30 will have carryover
stocks of almost 5.5 million tons of grain, including 3.5
million tons of wheat, Trehubenko said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
