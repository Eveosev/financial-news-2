The safety of Guinea-Bissau’s
leaders and the success of their efforts to curb the flow of
narcotics transiting through the West African nation are being
undermined by insufficient donor support, said Prime Minister
Carlos Gomes, Jr., according to le Soleil.  The nation is still a “fragile state,” where members of
his government “are running risks” by clamping down on the
organized drug trade, Gomes told foreign diplomats in Dakar, the
capital of  Senegal , on Feb. 15, according to the Dakar-based
newspaper.  The government has confiscated airplanes, burned all its
seized narcotics, closed its airport, and would like to sign
more aid agreements to continue the fight against organized
crime, Gomes said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
