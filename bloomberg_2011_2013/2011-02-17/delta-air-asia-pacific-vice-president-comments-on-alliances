Vinay Dube, senior vice president for
the Asia-Pacific region at  Delta Air Lines Inc ., said the
carrier will seek partners in  Asia  to help meet demand for
business travel. He spoke at a scheduled press briefing in Tokyo
today.  “Delta will continue to look for partners in Japan and
across Asia. Competition will be harsh with the various
alliances, but with our business strategies and quality service,
it will not be a zero-sum game.  “Demand in Asia will continue to grow for business
elites.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
