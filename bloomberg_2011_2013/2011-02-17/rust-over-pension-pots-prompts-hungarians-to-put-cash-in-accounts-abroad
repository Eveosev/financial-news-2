Hungary’s fiscal policies are
encouraging Peter Barta to hoard his money abroad.  The 35-year-old businessman started sending cash out of the
country after Premier  Viktor Orban  diverted 3 trillion forint
($15 billion) of private pension assets to plug the budget.  “I don’t feel the current legal environment guarantees the
security of my savings,” Barta, who declined to say where he
keeps his account, said in a phone interview. “The government
decision worries a lot of people. It’s a question of trust.”  Bankers in the country, among the first in former communist
Europe to open its financial services industry to foreign
companies, said Barta represents the growing disquiet over
government actions that they say risk eroding market and
business confidence just as Hungary needs to boost it.  Since coming to power in May with enough parliamentary
seats to amend the constitution, Orban, 47, imposed  Europe ’s
highest tax on banks and took over the pension system as part of
his promise to end five years of austerity measures. He also
drew criticism within the European Union for passing a law
restricting the media, legislation he yesterday pledged to
revise after bowing to pressure.  “The Fidesz government has proved it has a rich store of
ideas when it comes to taxes,” said Andras Jenei, a political
analyst at the Center for Fair Political Analysis in the
Hungarian capital. “Concern over the security of savings is
justifiable for higher income earners.”  IMF, EU Scrutiny  The  International Monetary Fund , the European Commission,
the  European Central Bank  and credit rating companies, all have
said the unconventional policies threaten budget stability and
undermine central bank independence.  The yield on  Hungary ’s benchmark 2016 bond surged to 8.36
percent, the highest in more than a year, after the government
announced the pension measures on Nov. 25. It has since dropped
115 basis points, or 1.15 percentage points, to 7.21 percent as
investors backed a plan to reduce the  budget deficit .  The government argues that taking pension assets and
imposing special taxes on industries including banking help meet
the goal of reducing the shortfall to less than 3 percent of
gross domestic product this year from 3.8 percent in 2010.  Hungary needed to funnel private pension funds into the
budget to save the retirement system and to begin reducing debt,
which is the country’s “enemy number one,” Orban said Feb. 2.  Saving in  Austria   While there’s little evidence a savings outflow threatens
to sap the reserves of banks including OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s
largest, and Raiffeisen Bank Hungary Zrt., there are signs
across the border in Austria that money is heading westward.  In the Austrian village of Andau, with 2,500 residents on
the border with Hungary, the local branch of Raiffeisen Bank has
two Hungarian-speaking employees to help customers, said branch
head Stefan Feiler. Though some are long-time savers who work in
Austria, many are part of a new wave of customers.  At  Bank Gutmann , a Vienna-based investment bank and manager
of assets for clients with average savings of 2 million euros
($2.73 million), the number of Hungarian customers increased
last year, said  Zoltan Baki , a member of the board at Gutmann
Hungary Investment Consulting in Budapest.  “People on the train and subway are asking me what they
should do with their money,” Lajos Bokros, Hungarian finance
minister from 1995 to 1996 and now a lawmaker in the European
Parliament, told Figyelo weekly in an interview published today.
“A huge number are putting their savings in Slovakian banks
while Austrian ones now even accept forint deposits. This is the
impact of the government’s policies.”  Deposits Drop  It’s unclear how many Hungarians have moved savings abroad
due to concerns about the pension law, which forced almost 3
million citizens to return to the state system.  Households withdrew a net 261 billion forint last year,
compared with net deposits of 357 billion forint in 2009,
according to  central bank statistics . In 2009, the economy
shrank 6.3 percent and the rate of unemployment jumped to a
record 11.8 percent in April last year.  “We have seen clients take their savings abroad,” said
Janos Docs, the director of  CIB Bank ’s business catering to the
wealthy. The Budapest-based unit of  Italy ’s Intesa SanPaolo SpA
manages 200 billion forint in savings. “This is undoubtedly an
existing phenomenon and it concerns already amassed assets, not
just future savings,” he said.  Household capital inflows into domestic investment funds
were almost zero in the fourth quarter, according to fund
managers’ association  Bamosz . Investment funds registered a
capital outflow of 32 billion forint in December for the first
time in 2010, Bamosz said on Jan. 17.  Worse Rates  Savers are fleeing the country even though  interest rates 
on deposits in forint were higher than in neighboring Austria,
Slovakia or  Switzerland , said Andor Daroczi, a  fund manager  at
MKB Bank in Budapest. Rates on forint-denominated  bank deposits 
averaged 5.1 percent last year, according to central bank data.  “Certain customers have become uncertain as to how safe
their savings are in Hungary,” Balazs Holics, the deputy
director at Raiffeisen Hungary’s private banking unit, said.
“We can’t talk about a mass exodus of clients, but there’s
definitely a rise in inquiries about moving assets abroad.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
