Petrol Group d.d., Slovenia’s
biggest energy group, is in talks with the government of
Montenegro to scale down its investment plans in the Balkan
nation.  Petrol in 2007 signed an agreement with state-owned
Montenegro Bonus d.o.o. to invest 154 million euros ($209
million) to build gas stations,  storage tanks  and gas pipelines.
The Slovenian company, based in  Ljubljana , now wants to lower
the amount to about 50 million euros, according to the spokesman
Aleksander Salkic.  “Petrol wants to lower the amount and we proposed that to
Montenegro Bonus and the government,” Salkic said today in a
phone interview from Ljubljana. “The contract has not been
annulled.”  The Montenegrin government has annulled the contract
between Petrol and Montenegro Bonus, which is now in talks with
Hungarian refiner Mol Nyrt. to replace Petrol, Dnevnik newspaper
 reported  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
