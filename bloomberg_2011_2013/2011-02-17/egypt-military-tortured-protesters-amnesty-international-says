The Egyptian military, which is
running the country after President  Hosni Mubarak ’s ouster,
tortured protesters to intimidate them and get information about
planned demonstrations, said  Amnesty International .  Former detainees said they were subjected to whippings,
beatings, electric shocks and threatened with rape, the rights
group said in a  statement  on its website today. At least two
protesters are still being held without charge after they were
arrested while carrying leaflets in Cairo in support of the
anti-government protests, Amnesty said, citing relatives and
friends of the men, who are brothers.  “The Egyptian military authorities have committed publicly
to creating a climate of freedom and democracy after so many
years of state repression. Now they must match their words with
direct and immediate action,” Malcolm Smart, Amnesty’s director
for the Middle East and North Africa, said in the statement.
“The military authorities must intervene to end torture and
other abuse of detainees, which we now know to have been taking
place in military custody.”  The allegations in the Amnesty statement are false, said an
Egyptian official who requested anonymity and declined to say
why he couldn’t be identified.  The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces has said it will
run  Egypt  during a transition period or until elections can take
place.  To contact the reporters on this story:
