  Spain ’s Finance Minister Elena Salgado will soften a decree establishing requirements regarding
core capital for Spanish savings banks,  Cinco Dias  reported,
citing unidentified people in financial markets.  Salgado will offer more flexibility on capital rules and
allow instruments that were not previously considered as core
capital, to be counted as such and thereby reduce the savings
banks’ need to capture funds, the newspaper said.  and extending the timetable for reaching the new requirements,
especially through stock market listings.
