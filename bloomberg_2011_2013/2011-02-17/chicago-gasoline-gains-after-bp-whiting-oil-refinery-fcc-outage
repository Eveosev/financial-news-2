  Chicago  gasoline rose for a second
day after a BP Plc refinery unit shut earlier this week,
disrupting local supplies.  BP started the fluid catalytic cracker at its Whiting
refinery in Indiana yesterday, according to a person familiar
with operations. The gasoline-making unit was shut Feb. 15 for
unplanned maintenance, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the information isnâ€™t public.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in
Chicago strengthened 2 cents to 7.5 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 2:33 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
increased 0.3 cent to $2.45 a gallon.  The discount narrowed from 14 cents on Feb. 15, the weakest
level in 11 months.  Flint Hills Resources LLC released gas from its Corpus
Christi West Refinery in  Texas  following the planned shutdown of
a cumene unit, according to a filing with state regulators.  The discount for 87 octane gasoline in the Gulf Coast
narrowed 0.12 cent to 5.13 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
