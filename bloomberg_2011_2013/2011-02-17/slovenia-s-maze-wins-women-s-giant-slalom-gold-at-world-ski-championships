Tina Maze  took her first world gold
medal by winning the giant slalom at the  FIS Alpine Ski World
Championships  in Garmisch-Partenkirchen,  Germany , today.  The Slovenian was the fastest over two runs, with a total
time of 2 minutes, 20.54 seconds. Skiing in her first world
championships, Italy’s  Federica Brignone  took the silver medal,
0.09 seconds back.  Tessa Worley  of  France , the giant slalom  World Cup  leader, finished third at 0.48 seconds behind.  The giant slalom is similar to the slalom, but with fewer
gates and wider turns.  Maze, 27, took the gold having led the race after the first
run, which was postponed by two hours because of fog on the
Kandahar piste. The world championships, which end Feb. 20, have
been hampered by adverse weather conditions since the start.  Elisabeth Goergl of  Austria  finished in tenth place. Goergl
last week beat pre-race favorites  Lindsey Vonn  of the U.S. and
Germany’s Maria Riesch in the speed events, taking gold in both
the super-G and the downhill.  Host nation Germany had a disappointing day, with Olympic
giant slalom champion  Viktoria Rebensburg  finishing in fifth
place. Rebensburg’s teammate  Kathrin Hoelzl , the defending giant
slalom world champion, pulled out of the second run because of a
back injury while Riesch fell in the second leg. Riesch, a
double Olympic champion who grew up in Garmisch, had been
struggling with the flu last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
