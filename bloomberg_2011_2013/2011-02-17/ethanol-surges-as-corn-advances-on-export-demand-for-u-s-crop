Ethanol futures rose for the first
time in five sessions as corn gained on signs that global demand
is increasing for the U.S. crop.  The grain-based gasoline additive climbed after the
Agriculture Department reported corn export sales in the week
ended Feb. 10 were 15 percent above the average of the previous
four weeks. Corn rose to a 31-month high.  “The bottom line is that I can take corn at this price
level and I can feed corn to livestock and I can feed corn to
ethanol and it still works,” said  Jason Ward , an analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investments in  Minneapolis . “There is no
sign of rationing of demand.”  Denatured ethanol for March delivery gained 6.5 cents, or
2.7 percent, to $2.505 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 47 percent in the past year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in the U.S. Gulf was
unchanged at $2.505 a gallon and in Chicago the additive jumped
2.5 cents, or 1 percent, to $2.455, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in  New York  added 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to
$2.56 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel increased 1.5
cents to $2.565.  Corn futures for May delivery rose 22 cents, or 3.1 percent,
to $7.23 a bushel on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The price
touched $7.245, the highest level for the most-active contract
since July 2008.  “The big difference between 2008 and this year is that I
can afford this price,” Ward said. “The pain threshold for the
end-user is higher today than it was in 2008.”  An average ethanol mill in Iowa is losing 8 cents on every
gallon produced while an Illinois plant is losing 2 cents a
gallon on a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online
grains information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
