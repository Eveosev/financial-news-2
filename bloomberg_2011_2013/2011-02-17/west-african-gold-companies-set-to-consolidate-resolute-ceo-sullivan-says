West African gold companies are set
for a round of mergers and acquisitions over the next two years,
driven by near-record prices, said  Resolute Mining Ltd .  “I expect some consolidation process to occur over the
next 12 months to two years,” Peter Sullivan, chief executive
officer of the Perth-based company,  said today in an interview.
Resolute, the second-largest Australian gold mining company,
also has mines in Mali and  Tanzania  as well as exploration
ground in  Ivory Coast .  Gold’s climb to a record high last year pushed takeovers in
the sector to an all-time high, including Kinross Gold Corp.’s
C$7.4 billion ($7.5 billion) takeover of West African miner Red
Back Mining Inc. Perseus Mining Ltd. and Adamus Resources Ltd.
may be possible takeover targets, UBS AG said last year.  “We can see ourselves being part of M&A activity in West
Africa, but assets are very well priced already because of the
high gold price,” said Sullivan. “Paper mergers are more
likely because of high share prices and investors prefer them
because they want the exposure to the gold sector rather than
being cashed out.”  Resolute rose 0.4 percent to A$1.39 at 2:08 p.m. Sydney
time, taking its gains on the Australian stock exchange over the
last twelve months to 32 percent. The company’s output is
forecast to rise to 380,000 ounces this fiscal year, from
352,303 last year, it said in a presentation this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
