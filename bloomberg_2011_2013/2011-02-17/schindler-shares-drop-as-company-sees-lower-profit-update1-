  Schindler Holding AG , the world’s
second-largest maker of elevators, declined 6.1 percent as the
Hergiswil, Switzerland-based company said it will make a
“slightly” lower profit this year.  The shares slid 6.8 francs to 104.4 in Zurich today, the
biggest decline since May 2009 and giving the company a market
value of 12.6 billion francs ($13.3 billion).  Restructuring costs in “weak markets” and a negative
currency impact from “the strong Swiss franc” will reduce net
income this year, Schindler said in a  statement  on its website
today. The company also faces increased material cost this year,
according to a presentation published today.  “The main disappointment is the weak outlook which
foresees deterioration where peers forecast sales and Ebit
improvement,” wrote Serge Rotzer, an analyst at Vontobel AG in
Zurich, in a note to customers today. “The only positive was
the high net cash pile of 2.5 billion francs and the higher
dividend,” wrote Rotzer, who has a “hold” rating on the
shares since April, according to Bloomberg data.  Schindler’s net income rose 8.3 percent to 677 million
francs in 2010, and the company is proposing to pay out a total
dividend of 3 francs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
