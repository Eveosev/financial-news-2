Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said many small U.S. banks are still struggling with
commercial real estate loans and their woes will hurt small
businesses.  “A lot of small banks across the country still got
themselves way overexposed to commercial real estate and have a
lot of digging out to do,” Geithner told the Senate Budget
Committee today. “That’s going to be a problem for the small
businesses that were, frankly, unlucky in their choice of
bank.”  Geithner said a U.S. program to help small banks obtain
capital at “a very economically attractive price” has received
about 250 applications. “We’re going to be approving those
eligible banks as quickly as we can, and they will help leverage
a substantial amount of borrowing capacity available to small
businesses.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
