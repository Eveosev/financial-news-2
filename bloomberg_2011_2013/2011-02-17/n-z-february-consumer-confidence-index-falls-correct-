New Zealand consumer confidence
slumped to a 19-month low, weighed down by more pessimism about
personal finances and the economy’s performance in the next year,
a private survey showed.  The ANZ-Roy Morgan confidence index fell to 108.1 this
month from 117.1 in January, Wellington-based ANZ National Bank
Ltd. said today in an e-mailed statement. The index dropped to
its lowest since July 2009 from a seven-month high last month.  Declining consumer confidence adds to the case for a
sluggish recovery this year, which may prompt central bank
Governor Alan Bollard to leave the benchmark interest rate
unchanged until the second half, economists including  Craig Ebert  at Bank of New Zealand Ltd. say. Finance Minister Bill English today said consumers are reducing debt and that has
limited retail spending.  “Households remain cautious toward spending and how they
perceive the economy is evolving,” ANZ Chief Economist Cameron Bagrie said in the statement.  The number of respondents saying they expect the economy
will deteriorate over the next 12 months rose to 36 percent from
31 percent in January, while the number expecting better times
fell to 31 percent, today’s report showed.  The proportion of the 1,040 respondents who said they are
worse off financially now than a year ago rose to 44 percent and
more expect to be worse off in a year, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
