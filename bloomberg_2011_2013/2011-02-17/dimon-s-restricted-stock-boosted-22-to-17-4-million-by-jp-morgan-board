  JPMorgan Chase & Co ., the second-
largest U.S. bank by assets, boosted Chief Executive Officer  Jamie Dimon ’s 2010 restricted stock payout by 22 percent to
$17.4 million.  The board awarded Dimon 251,415 restricted shares valued at
about $12.1 million based on the Feb. 16 closing price,
according to a filing yesterday with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission. He also received 367,377 options valued at
$5.3 million, based on Bloomberg calculations.  That compares with 195,704 restricted shares valued at
$7.95 million and 563,562 options valued at $6.24 million
awarded last year for his work in 2009, according to disclosures
by the New York-based company.  Dimon, 54, may have also received a cash bonus for 2010 as
well that hasn’t yet been disclosed. He took a salary of $1
million and gave up bonuses for 2008 after receiving $49.9
million in total compensation for 2007, which included cash and
restricted stock bonuses of $14.5 million each.  JPMorgan awarded Dimon’s top 15 executives more than $73
million in restricted shares, plus  stock options , for their
performance in 2010, according to Jan. 21 SEC filings. That
compares with $64.2 million in stock granted to his top 16
executives a year ago, filings at the time show.  Blankfein, Gorman  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. gave Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer  Lloyd Blankfein  a $12.6 million stock bonus for 2010.
The New York-based firm also raised Blankfein’s salary to $2
million from $600,000.  James Gorman , Morgan Stanley’s top
executive since January 2010, got deferred stock and options
valued at about $7.4 million for his performance last year.  JPMorgan reported a record $17.4 billion profit for the
year, buoyed by $7 billion in pretax reserves that were added
back to earnings as  credit quality  and the  U.S. economy 
improved. JPMorgan’s shares rose 1.8 percent during the year.  A majority of Dimon’s wealth is in JPMorgan stock. He and
his wife owned directly or through trusts and retirement plans
more than 5 million shares valued at more than $221 million as
of Jan. 19, when his total holdings were last disclosed.  Jes Staley, 54, CEO of the investment bank, received the
second-biggest share of JPMorgan’s compensation pool with $8
million in restricted shares and 230,770 stock options, the
filings show. Chief Investment Officer Ina Drew, 54, got the
next-highest payout with $7.4 million in restricted shares and
153,847 options.  To contact the reporters on this story:
