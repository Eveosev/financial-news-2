Copper rebounded from a two-week low
as improving U.S. economic data signaled that the recovery will
continue to strengthen and lift metals demand.  Manufacturing in the Philadelphia region expanded in
February at the fastest pace in seven years, and an index of
U.S. leading indicators rose in January for a seventh straight
month, separate reports showed today. The metal has jumped 38
percent in the past year as miners struggled to keep pace with
increasing global consumption.  “Copper has good fundamentals, and the uptrend in prices
is still intact,” said Rich Ilczyszyn, a senior strategist at
Lind-Waldock, a broker in  Chicago .  Copper futures for May delivery rose 1.45 cents, or 0.3
percent, to close at $4.497 a pound at 1:24 p.m. on the Comex in
New York. Earlier, the price touched $4.4275, the lowest for a
most-active contract since Jan. 31.  Futures touched a record $4.6575 on Feb. 15. The metal will
make new highs within a month, Ilczyszyn said.  The global copper market’s surplus narrowed to 20,000
metric tons last year from 410,000 tons in 2009, the World
Bureau of Metal Statistics said yesterday. The average output of
the world’s 10 largest publicly traded mining companies fell 4
percent in 2010 from a year earlier as ore grades declined, RBS
Global Banking and Markets said in a report last week.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months dropped $37, or 0.4 percent, to $9,805 a ton ($4.45 a
pound).  Tin fell 2.6 percent to $31,650 a ton on the LME, the
biggest decline since Nov. 22. Lead and nickel also dropped.
Aluminum and zinc gained.  To contact the reporter on this story:
