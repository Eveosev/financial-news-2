  Cap Gemini SA ,  Europe ’s largest
computer-services company, said full-year profit rose 57 percent
on stronger technology demand, beating analysts’ estimates. The
company’s shares had their biggest gain in almost seven months.  Net income at the Paris-based company rose to 280 million
euros ($380 million), or 1.80 euros a share, from 178 million
euros, or 1.16 euros, last year. Analysts had estimated net of
260 million euros. Sales rose 3.9 percent to 8.7 billion euros.  Chief Executive Officer Paul Hermelin is looking to
increase sales by between 9 and 10 percent this year as the
company, like other computer-service providers, gains from a
rebound in corporate technology spending.  Atos Origin SA , Cap
Gemini’s largest domestic rival, yesterday said its full-year
profit more than tripled, aided by higher-margin sales.  “There is a rebound in the sector, even if it’s gradual,”
Hermelin said on a conference call with reporters today.  Cap
Gemini  will hunt for small technology acquisitions, plus one or
two “medium to large” deals each year, he said.  The company’s shares rose as much as 6.6 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since July 29. They traded 5.9 percent
higher at 42.21 euros as of 9:07 a.m. in Paris, giving the
company a market value of 6.5 billion euros.  Last year, Cap Gemini paid 233 million euros for control of
Brazilian IT company CPM Braxis, in addition to buying small
companies in areas such as energy systems.  More Competition  Cap Gemini said it is proposing a dividend for 2010 of 1
euro a share, up from 80 cents in the previous year. The
company, whose operating margin slid 0.3 percent to 6.8 percent
of revenue last year, expects a 50 to 100 basis points
improvement this year.  “Most cyclical businesses” in  North America  had sales
growth of 10 percent in 2010, driven by technology and financial
services, the company said. In  France , sales fell 1 percent over
the year, with growth in the fourth quarter.  The company will soon face a stronger local rival in Atos,
which is scheduled this year to complete a merger with Siemens
AG’s computer-services unit to leapfrog Cap Gemini as the No. 1
computer-services provider in Europe.  In the meantime, Cap Gemini is expanding its offerings in
cloud computing and energy management services for utilities,
which may attract as much as $46 billion in spending on so-
called smart grids by 2015, according to  ABI Research .  To contact the reporters on this story:
