The French government’s efforts to
cut the  budget deficit  to 3 percent of output by 2013 may not be
enough amid sluggish economic growth,  state auditor  said.  “For the budget plan to be totally credible, the
structural effort must be more ambitious and measures to get
there should be quickly detailed,” the Paris-based auditor said
in its yearly report. A copy of the report was given today to
President  Nicolas Sarkozy  by the Cour des Comptes, president
Didier Migaud.  The auditor said the  2009-2012 budget bill  doesn’t give
enough details on how the administration will improve public
accounts. It also said that three-quarters of 10 billion euros
($13.6 billion) in extra taxes aimed at shrinking the budget gap
are temporary measures that won’t sustain future  deficit
reduction .  The state auditor had warned Sarkozy’s government in June
2010 that it had to cut spending by 20 billion euros annually
from 2011 to stop the country’s debt from increasing.    France ’s economy will expand 1.3 percent in the first-half
of 2011, statistics institute Insee said Dec. 16. The prediction
suggests that the 2 percent growth rate forecast by government
for all of 2011 is optimistic, undermining his effort to cut the
deficit to 6 percent of gross domestic product Growth must
accelerate to 0.8 percent per quarter in the second half to meet
the government forecast if  Insee  is correct, the institute said.  “GDP growth and the public receipts may be lower than the
budget bill targets, which would make it more difficult to bring
the deficit down to 3 percent in 2013,” the auditor said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
