New York Mayor  Michael Bloomberg 
presented a $65.6 billion  preliminary budget  for next fiscal
year that would reduce the city’s 78,000 teachers by 6,166.  The mayor, 69, said the biggest U.S. city also might have
to fire hundreds of other workers if lawmakers in  Albany  reject
$600 million in state aid he’s already placed in the budget. The
amount includes unrestricted revenue-sharing funds, school aid
and a request to end a $12,000 yearly supplement to pensions for
retired police and firefighters.  “If we don’t get these or similar kinds of things, then we
have this $600 million to cover,” the mayor said. “It will
hurt every single agency.”  The job cuts are needed even though an  improving economy 
bolstered by $34 billion in Wall Street profits over the past
two years and record tourism will help pour about $2 billion of
unanticipated revenue into city coffers through June 30, 2012,
Bloomberg said. About 4,666 teachers would be fired under the
mayor’s plan, with the rest removed through attrition.  The budget  next goes to the City Council, which will modify
it in negotiation with the administration. They must approve a
final plan by June 30.  Since June, the city has compensated for the loss of
federal and state aid to the schools by replacing it with $1.86
billion in taxpayer-generated revenue, Bloomberg said. The
schools will receive $2.2 billion more in 2012, totaling $22
billion, than in the current fiscal year, he said.  ‘Bizarre’ Plan  Michael Mulgrew, president of the  United Federation of
Teachers , described Bloomberg’s intention to fire teachers as
“bizarre” in light of the mayor’s own prediction of increased
city revenue and Governor  Andrew Cuomo ’s statement this month
that “the state budget should not require local layoffs.”  Bloomberg said New York faces deficits of about $4.9
billion for fiscal 2013 and $4.8 billion the following year.  Pension expenses, now about $6.8 billion, will increase to
$8.3 billion next year and rise to $8.6 billion in 2015, the
spending plan predicted.  Bloomberg said the city could save $1 billion by 2019 if
the state Legislature approves changes that would require future
non-uniform employees to work until 65 to get full benefits,
eliminate overtime pay from benefit calculations and increase
workers’ contributions to  retirement plans .  ‘Unacceptable Level’  Harry Nespoli, president of the Municipal Labor Committee,
a coalition of city-worker unions, said the preliminary plan
“contains an unacceptable level of service and personnel
reductions,” and will result in “reducing the quality of life
here.”  The mayor could have saved $100 million by renegotiating
contracts with private vendors, Nespoli said, and he called upon
the mayor to seek more revenue by backing a continuation of a
state income-tax surcharge set to expire on the highest earners.  Reduced agency services would include elimination of 20
fire companies; 16,624 child-care placements due to lost federal
aid; 350 civilian police positions; and $28.5 million less for
libraries and cultural institutions.  The mayor reduced a proposed cut in  capital spending  to 10
percent from the 20 percent he contemplated in November. That
would save about $800 million in debt service payments through
2021, he said.  The mayor is founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News
parent Bloomberg LP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
