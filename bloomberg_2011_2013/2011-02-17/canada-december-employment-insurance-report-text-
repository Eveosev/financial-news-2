The following is the text of
Canada's employment insurance report for Dec. released
by Statistics  Canada .  In December, 659,700 people received regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits, down 9,400 (-1.4%) from November
and the third consecutive monthly decrease. The number of
beneficiaries declined in every province and territory,
except the Northwest Territories.  Employment Insurance claims little changed  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. In December, 249,000 initial and renewal claims
were received, a modest increase of 970 (+0.4%) from the
previous month.  In Quebec, the number of claims increased by 3,500
(+4.9%) in December, offsetting much of the decline in
November. In Ontario, the number of claims rose by 970
(+1.2%), the third consecutive monthly increase.  In all other provinces, fewer people filed a claim in
December or no change was noted. Decreases in claims were
most pronounced in Saskatchewan (-8.1%) and  New Brunswick 
(-5.6%).  There has been little overall change in the number of
claims since July 2010. Claims provide an indication of
the number of people who could become beneficiaries.  Beneficiaries down in all provinces  The number of regular beneficiaries declined in every
province in December. This was the third consecutive
monthly decrease for 9 of the 10 provinces, Nova Scotia
being the exception.  The most notable declines in December were in Ontario,
Quebec, British Columbia and Nova Scotia. In Ontario, the
number of beneficiaries decreased by 3,600 (-1.7%) to
206,800. In Quebec, it fell by 2,100 (-1.1%) to 186,000,
while in British Columbia, it declined by 1,500 (-1.8%) to
78,900.  In Nova Scotia, the number of people receiving benefits
decreased by 1,100 (-3.2%) to 33,200 in December, more
than offsetting the increase in November.  Sub-provincial and demographic overview  Employment Insurance data by sub-provincial region, sex
and age are not seasonally adjusted and are therefore
compared on a year-over-year basis.  Continued year-over-year declines in most large centres  Between December 2009 and December 2010, the number of
regular beneficiaries fell by 87,100 (-11.8%) at the
national level, with declines in 117 of the 143 large
centres (see map). The number of large centres reporting
year-over-year declines has been relatively stable over
the past nine months. Large centres are those with a
population of 10,000 or more.  In Newfoundland and Labrador, the number of
beneficiaries declined in all five large centres. The
fastest rate of decline occurred in Labrador City, which
registered fewer beneficiaries in all 12 months of 2010 on
a year-over-year basis. In St. John's, the number of
beneficiaries fell by 730 to 4,600, the largest of nine
consecutive months of year-over-year declines.  In Quebec, the number of regular beneficiaries fell in
27 of the 33 large centres between December 2009 and
December 2010. The fastest declines occurred in Lachute,
Granby, Saint-Georges, Saguenay, La Tuque, and Sorel-
Tracy. Montreal recorded 6,100 fewer beneficiaries, the
10th consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The
number of beneficiaries was little changed in the census
metropolitan area of  Quebec .  In Ontario, most large centres posted declines, most
notably Greater Sudbury, Guelph, Belleville, Tillsonburg,
and Kitchener-Cambridge-Waterloo. In Toronto, the number
fell by 16,600 to 71,300, the 10th consecutive month of
year-over-year declines.  In  Alberta , all 12 large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in December compared with December 2009. The
pace of decline was fastest in Brooks, Camrose, Red Deer,
Grande Prairie, Medicine Hat and Calgary. The number of
beneficiaries fell year-over-year for the ninth
consecutive month in both Calgary and Edmonton. In
Calgary, the number fell by 6,700 to 13,000, while in  Edmonton , it declined by 3,500 to 13,900.  In British Columbia, most large centres had fewer
beneficiaries in December than a year earlier. The rate of
decline was most pronounced in Fort St. John, Port
Alberni, Campbell River and Prince George. In  Vancouver ,
32,400 people received regular benefits in December, down
3,700 from a year earlier. The number of beneficiaries
fell by 600 to 3,900 in Victoria.  Demographic groups  Faster decline in the number of beneficiaries among men
than women  Between December 2009 and December 2010, the number of
male EI regular beneficiaries fell by 14.9% to 398,800,
the 10th consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The
pace of decline was fastest among men under 25 years of
age (-19.1%) and those aged 25 to 54 (-17.5%). The decline
among men aged 55 and over was much slower (-2.7%).  Over this year-long period, the number of female
beneficiaries decreased by 6.5% to 250,100, the seventh
consecutive month of year-over-year declines. The most
prominent decline was among women under 25 years of age (-
15.6%), followed by an 8.5% decline for those aged 25 to
54. In contrast, there was a 5.4% increase among women
aged 55 and over.  Note to readers  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified.  Each month,  Statistics Canada  provides analysis of the
current labour market situation, using Employment
Insurance (EI) statistics and other sources. Earlier this
month, the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provided a picture of
overall labour market conditions, including unemployment,
total employment and those affected by changes in the
labour market.  In this release, Statistics Canada provides additional
sub-provincial detail through the EI statistics. Details
by industry will follow with data from the Survey of
Employment, Payrolls and Hours.  EI statistics are produced from an administrative data
source from Human Resources and Skills Development Canada.
These statistics may, from time to time, be affected by
changes to the Employment Insurance Act or administrative
procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries and the
number of claims received for November and December 2010
are preliminary. In this release, large centres correspond
to those with a population of 10,000 or more.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all persons
who received EI benefits from December 5 to 11. This
period coincides with the reference week of the LFS.  EI statistics indicate the number of people who
received EI benefits, and should not be confused with data
coming from the LFS, which provides information on the
total number of unemployed people.  There are always a certain proportion of unemployed
people who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed
people have not contributed to the program because they
have not worked in the past 12 months or their employment
is not insured. Other unemployed people have contributed
to the program but do not meet the eligibility criteria,
such as workers who left their job voluntarily or those
who did not accumulate enough hours of work to receive
benefits.  The change in the number of regular EI beneficiaries
reflects various situations, including people becoming
beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.
