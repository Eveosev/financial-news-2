Middle East crude oils remained at
premiums to their benchmarks as refiners purchased cargoes amid
gains in processing profits.  Murban for April loading was at a premium of 11 cents a
barrel to its official selling price, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Qatar Marine for the same month was also steady at
a premium of 4 cents a barrel.  Refiner demand for cargoes has remained ample as they are
taking advantage of higher processing profits. The margin from
running benchmark Dubai crude through a plant capable of
upgrading  fuel oil  into gasoline and diesel was at $4.62 a
barrel yesterday in Singapore, according to netback calculations
by Bloomberg and EnSys Energy. Thatâ€™s up from the six-month
average of $3.21.  Oman oil for immediate loading rose $1.85, or 1.9 percent,
to $99.59 a barrel today, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Dubai for loading in April was up $1.85 to $99.38.
Murban crude climbed 1.8 percent to $102.52.  Oman futures for April delivery gained 5 cents to $99.70 a
barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 5:19 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,351 contracts traded. The settlement price was set
at $99.62 at 12:30 p.m. Dubai time.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for April, or EFS,
widened 10 cents to $4.35 a barrel, according to data from PVM
Oil Associates Ltd. The exchange for swaps for May increased 7
cents to $4.40.  To contact the reporter on this story:
