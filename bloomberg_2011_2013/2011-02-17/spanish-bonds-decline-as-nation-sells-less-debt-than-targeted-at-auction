Spanish 10-year bonds declined for
the first day in three, leading so-called peripheral debt lower,
after the country sold fewer bonds than the maximum targeted.  The yield on the 10-year bond rose as  Spain  sold 1 billion
euros ($1.4 billion) of bonds maturing in 2037 and 2.5 billion
euros of bonds due 2020. The debt office had set a target sales
range of 3 billion to 4 billion euros. Investors bid for 1.53
times the amount of the 2037 security on offer, down from a so-
called bid-to-cover of 1.99 times at the previous sale of the
bonds on Feb. 18, 2010. Demand for the 10-year debt fell to 1.54
times the securities sold from 1.67 at an auction in December.  “This is not a good result for Spain,” said  Glenn Marci ,
a strategist at DZ Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “In the longer end
they fell short of their target. From an absolute yield
perspective, the auction wasn’t too bad.”  The yield on the Spanish 5.5 percent security maturing in
April 2021 rose four basis points to 5.38 percent as of
10:26 a.m. in  London . Italian 10-year bonds declined, pushing
the yield four basis points higher to 4.77 percent.  The German 10-year bund yield was little changed at
3.23 percent and the two-year yield was at 1.38 percent.  German  government bonds  lost investors 1.75 percent this
year, while French debt lost 1.5 percent, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Greek debt returned investors 3 percent,
with Spanish bonds gaining 1.6 percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
