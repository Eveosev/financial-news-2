  Singapore ’s stockpiles of residues,
or  fuel oil , rose from the lowest in 18 months, data from the
Ministry of Trade and Industry showed.  Onshore inventories of residues, including fuel oil and
low-sulfur waxy residue and excluding bitumen, rose 7.2 percent
to 16.9 million in the seven days to Feb. 16,  International
Enterprise Singapore  said in an e-mailed statement today.
Supplies dropped to 15.8 million in the nine days to Feb. 9, the
lowest since July 29, 2009.  Stockpiles of middle distillates, including gasoil and
kerosene, fell 0.3 percent to 13.7 million barrels. Light
distillates such as naphtha, reformate and gasoline decreased
1.8 percent to 10.7 million barrels.  The trade ministry surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
