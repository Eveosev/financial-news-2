Boston Marathon  organizers will
allow more time to enter the 2012 race after the field for this
year’s edition filled up in eight hours, leaving qualified
runners who had trained for the event without a place.  Runners urged organizers to “institute a system which
recognizes athletic performance above all else,” Tom Grilk, the
executive director of the Boston Athletic Association, said in a
statement on its  website .  Under the  plan , athletes with the best qualifying times
will be allowed to sign up first, with slower athletes being
given access to registration at later dates. Elite runners are
recruited separately. About 20,000 runners on average
participate annually.  “Our new registration process enables those who qualify by
the greatest amount of time to have the longest period to
enter,” Grilk said.  Registration  for 2012 will begin Sept. 12 for runners who
have times at least 20 minutes faster than the minimum
requirement for their age and gender. Two days later, runners
with times at least 10 minutes faster than required will be able
to register, followed by those who qualified by at least 5
minutes on Sept. 16.  If the field isn’t full by the end of the first week,
general qualifiers will be allowed to register, beginning on
Sept. 19. General qualifiers will be added to the field based on
the fastest times among their age groups and gender until the
race limit is reached.  Oldest Marathon  The Boston Marathon is the world’s oldest annual marathon,
having first taken place in 1897, and is one of the five World
 Marathon Majors . The 115th edition will be run on April 18.  Organizers will also drop  qualifying times  by five minutes,
beginning with the 2013 race.  Men aged 18-34 will be required to cover 26.2 miles (42.2
kilometers) in 3 hours, 5 minutes, with women in the same age
group given an extra 30 minutes. Times then increase by 5
minutes for each of the race’s remaining 10 age groups.  The last time organizers adjusted qualifying standards for
all runners was in 1980.  Kenya’s Robert Kiprono Cheruiyot won the 2010 race in a
record time of 2:05:52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
