Motor racing series GP2  Asia 
cancelled a race in  Bahrain  this weekend after three people died
in anti-government protests overnight, the series said in a
statement on its website.  The same circuit in the desert south of capital Manama is
scheduled to host the opening round of the Formula One season
next month. GP2 is a junior series with ties to Formula One, the
worldâ€™s most-watched motor racing series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
