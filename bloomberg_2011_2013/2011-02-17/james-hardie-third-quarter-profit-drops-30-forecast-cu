  James Hardie Industries SE , the
biggest seller of home siding in the U.S., said operating profit
fell 30 percent in the third quarter and cut its full-year
forecast.   Income excluding asbestos compensation payments dropped to
$21 million in the three months to Dec. 31, from $29.8 million a
year ago, the Dublin-based company said in a statement to the
Australian stock exchange today. The Australian-listed company
cut its forecast for operating income before adjustments to a
range of $105 million to $115 million for the full year from its
earlier expectation of between $110 million and $125 million.  Mounting foreclosures and an  unemployment rate  in the U.S.
that will average more than 9 percent in 2011 suggest
homebuilding may take time to rebound. U.S. construction
spending decreased 10 percent in 2010 after dropping 15 percent
the prior year.  “Market conditions in the U.S. residential housing sector,
while less volatile than in prior periods, remain weak and
challenging,” Chief Executive Officer Louis Gries said in the
statement. “A combination of factors such as high levels of
unemployment, low levels of  consumer confidence , restricted
access to credit and excess housing inventory continue to hinder
growth in the residential housing construction market.”  Recent interest rate increases in  Australia  -- four times
during 2010 -- and flooding in Queensland, New South  Wales  and
Victoria are expected to damp demand, the company said.  Including asbestos-related payments, the company reported a
third-quarter loss of $26.4 million from a $14.9 million profit
a year earlier. This includes an asbestos-related adjustment of
$46.4 million due to the Australian dollar’s gain against the  U.S. dollar , the company said.  The shares rose 0.9 percent to A$6.63 at the 4:10 p.m.
close of trade in Sydney after earlier sliding as much as 5.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
