  Chicago  Blackhawks coach Joel Quenneville is resting comfortably in the hospital after being
admitted yesterday with gastrointestinal bleeding, the National
Hockey League team said today in a statement.  Quenneville, 52, became ill at his suburban Chicago home
two nights ago and was admitted the following morning, according
to team doctor Michael Terry.  “He has been stabilized and today the cause of the
bleeding was determined to be a small ulcer caused by aspirin,”
Terry said.  The team expects Quenneville to make a full recovery and to
return home in the next few days, Terry said. Assistant Mike Haviland will assume coaching duties until Quenneville is able
to return.  Quenneville is 125-66-25 in three seasons with Chicago,
leading the team to two consecutive Western Conference finals
and the 2010 Stanley Cup title. The Blackhawks are 29-22-6 this
season, four points behind the Calgary Flames for the
conference’s eighth and final playoff spot.  To contact the reporter on this story:
