Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
said governance of the international monetary order is
“diffuse” and “ineffective,” increasing inflation risks in
emerging markets and disinflation in advanced economies.  Carney, speaking at a conference in Paris organized by the  Institute of International Finance , said there are no “clear
rules of engagement” to promote well-functioning markets, with
the  International Monetary Fund  “effectively” powerless to
sanction countries. Informal institutions like the Group of
Seven are losing legitimacy, he said.  “We need a system that functions better,” Carney said.
The current system “is an increasingly unstable hybrid of fixed
and floating exchange-rate regimes. It promoted in our opinion
the enormous build of debt that preceded the crisis and is
complicating the necessary balance sheet repair in its wake.”    France ’s focus on reforming the international monetary
system, as president of the Group of 20 countries this year, is
warranted, said Carney, who is in Paris for a two-day meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers that starts tomorrow.
China will probably face renewed pressure to allow its currency
to appreciate at the meeting.  “Systems dominated by fixed exchange rates seldom cope
well with major structural change,” said Carney, citing the
emergence of emerging markets as the main drivers of global
growth.  To contact the reporters on this story:
