Russia’s RTS stock-index futures
climbed as oil, the country’s main export earner, gained in  New
York  on concern civil unrest in the Middle East may disrupt
supplies from the region.  Futures on the RTS Index expiring in March increased 0.1
percent to 186,920 at 11:10 a.m. in New York. The Market Vectors
Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that holds Russian shares, fell
1.1 percent. Futures on OAO Lukoil, the country’s second-biggest
oil producer, rose 0.1 percent and contracts on OAO Gazprom, the
natural-gas export monopoly, gained 0.2 percent.  Crude advanced 0.2 percent, to $85.14 a barrel on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
