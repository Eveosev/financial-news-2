  United Continental Holdings Inc .,
the world’s largest carrier, will extend  United Airlines ’
Economy Plus seating to Continental Airlines as the two fleets
merge.  Economy Plus, introduced by United in 1999, gives
passengers who pay an additional fee as much as 5 inches more
legroom on some seats in the forward part of the economy-class
cabin. Continental aircraft will offer the option starting in
2012, the Chicago-based company said today in a statement.  The decision to put Economy Plus on both fleets moves the
carriers closed to a single operation, slated for sometime in
2012. Since their merger closed in October, United and
Continental have continued to fly under their own names.  “Our customers value Economy Plus and the additional
personal space that it provides,” Jim Compton, United
Continental chief revenue officer, said in the statement. The
cost to add Economy Plus to Continental’s planes wasn’t
disclosed.  The price for Economy Plus seating ranges from $9 each way
on a short U.S. flight to $109 for  Los Angeles  to Tokyo.
Passengers can choose the option for a full year for $425,
according to United’s  website.   Economy Plus will expand from 359 jets in United’s main
fleet to 700 at the combined carrier. The seats also will be
added to larger regional jets at Continental, joining 150 at
United, the company said.  The move follows Delta Air Lines Inc.’s decision last week
to add premium economy seats with more legroom on its longest
international flights, expanding revenue sources beyond fares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
