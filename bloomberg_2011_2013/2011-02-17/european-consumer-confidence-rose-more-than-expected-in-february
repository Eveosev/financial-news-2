European  consumer confidence  rose
more than economists forecast in February, adding to signs the
economy is gathering strength.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
rose to minus 9.9 from minus 11.2 in January, the Brussels-based
European Commission said today in an initial estimate.
Economists forecast a gain to minus 11, the median of 22
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey showed.  The commission is scheduled to publish its monthly report
on euro-area economic confidence, which includes the consumer-
confidence gauge, on Feb. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
