A resumption of Egyptian buying
boosted tea prices at this week’s sale in Mombasa,  Kenya , the
world’s biggest auction of the leaf, said Geoff Darrel, managing
director of Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd.  African tea prices rose for the first week in four,
advancing 3.3 percent to an average of $2.79 a kilogram (2.2
pounds) this week, the Mombasa-based brokerage said yesterday.
Some grades of tea at the auction climbed as much as 10 percent.  “Things are looking more positive for us in regards to the
Egyptian market,” Darrel said in a phone interview. Buyers from  Egypt  returned to the market this week after being absent for
three weeks amid political protests that led to the ouster of
Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak , he said.  Kenya is the world’s biggest exporter of black tea.
Production of the leaf may decline as much as 12 percent this
year because of drought, according to the Kenya Tea Board. A
lack of rainfall may boost prices to as much as $3.50 a kilogram
by midyear,  Aly-Khan Satchu , a Nairobi, Kenya-based independent
financial analyst, said last month.  Prices may also increase “as the Egyptian market
stabilizes,” Darrel said.  The Mombasa auction sells tea from countries including
Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda and Burundi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
