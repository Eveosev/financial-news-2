  Centrica Plc , Britain’s biggest
energy supplier, plans to close the Rough natural-gas storage
site for 14 days of maintenance in September.  “The current plan is normal annual maintenance for two
weeks in September as per the last few years,” James Lawson, a
sales manager at Centrica Storage, said by e-mail today.  A formal announcement will be made before the start of the
storage year in May, Lawson said. The starting date may be
amended as much as a month before work is due to begin, he said.  Total capacity at Rough, a depleted North Sea gas field 18
miles (29 kilometers) off  England ’s northeast coast, is 118
billion cubic feet (3.3 billion cubic meters).  To contact the reporter on this story:
