SolarCity Inc., a closely held
installer and owner of roof-top power systems, purchased
GroSolar’s residential unit to expand into  New York ,  New Jersey ,
Massachusetts and  Pennsylvania .  SolarCity’s second acquisition in a month will add 55
employees with expertise in building regulations and local
subsidies that Chief Executive Officer Lyndon Rive says are
necessary for the company to grow in the region cost-
effectively. He didn’t disclose the price.  “There are strong local and state incentives in the
Northeast right now that make this the best time to go solar,”
Rive said in an interview. “We do not expect that to last.”  SolarCity last month bought Clean Currents Solar from its
parent, Rockville, Maryland-based  Clean Currents LLC , a closely
held supplier of renewable energy.  GroSolar, based in White River Junction,  Vermont , will
continue to install solar systems for commercial customers.  Foster City, California-based  SolarCity , which designs and
maintains most of the systems it installs, now has more than
1,000 employees in 10 states and has completed at least 10,000
roof-top projects in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
