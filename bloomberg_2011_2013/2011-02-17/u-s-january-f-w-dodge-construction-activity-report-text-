Following is the text of the monthly
McGraw-Hill Construction Dodge report.  January Construction Falls 6 Percent  The value of new construction starts retreated 6% in January to a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $423.4 billion, according to
McGraw-Hill Construction, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies.
The decline came as the result of a pullback for nonresidential
building after a strong December, combined with a loss of momentum
for residential building. At the same time, the nonbuilding
construction sector showed further growth in January on top of its
elevated December pace, aided by several large public works
projects. On an unadjusted basis, total construction starts in
January were reported at $28.4 billion, down 4% from the same
month a year ago.  The January statistics lowered the Dodge Index to 90 (2000=100),
compared to December’s reading of 95. Over the course of 2010, the
Dodge Index fluctuated within the range of 80 to 96, with the
average for the year coming in at 88. “The construction start
statistics continue to move in an up-and-down pattern, showing
that overall activity has stabilized in a broad sense but has not
yet gained sufficient traction for renewed expansion to take hold,”
stated Robert A. Murray, vice president of economic affairs for
McGraw-Hill Construction. “Over the past two years, public works
construction has held up fairly well, and healthy activity was
reported for this sector in January. However, public works
construction is likely to slip in coming months, given waning
support from the federal stimulus act and mounting fiscal stress
for federal, state, and local governments. This fiscal stress will
also have a dampening impact on various institutional building
types, such as school construction. For total construction starts
to register growth in 2011, it will require more upward movement
from housing, after the tenuous gains witnessed during 2010. It
will also require some upward movement or at least stability for
commercial building, after last year’s extremely depressed
activity. One early positive sign for commercial building is that
vacancy rates appear to have topped off during 2010, and are now
receding slightly.”  Nonresidential building in January dropped 13% to $138.3 billion
(annual rate), following December’s strong 27% gain. Healthcare
facilities in December were lifted by the start of six massive
hospital projects, and January showed this category retreating 46%
from its exceptional December amount. The healthcare category in
January was still 7% above its monthly average for 2010 as a whole,
and included the start of two large hospital projects located in
San Leandro CA ($575 million) and Oakland CA ($244 million).
Transportation terminal work in January was also down sharply,
falling 75%, compared to a robust December that included the start
of a $450 million airport terminal project at Love Field in Dallas
TX. The largest transportation terminal project in January was an
$86 million airport terminal expansion in Myrtle Beach SC. Other
institutional categories showing decreased contracting in January
were public buildings, down 2%; churches, down 4%; and amusement-
related work, down 29%. Educational buildings, the largest
nonresidential building category, held steady in January. Support
came from groundbreaking for two large high schools located in  Texas  ($112 million) and  South Carolina  ($75 million), plus the
start of a $100 million medical school building in New Jersey and
a $71 million art museum in  Florida .  The commercial structure types showed a mixed performance in
January. Stores and warehouses slipped further, with January
declines of 2% and 4%, respectively. Office construction in
January registered a 5% gain, helped by groundbreaking for four
projects valued each in excess of $100 million. These included two
corporate office buildings, located in Boston MA ($252 million)
and Beachwood OH ($120 million), a federal government office
building in Clarksburg WV ($130 million), and a  data center  in
Boydton VA ($125 million). The hotel category in January increased
23%, lifted by the start of a $295 million convention center hotel
in Washington DC. The manufacturing plant category also showed
growth in January, climbing 180% from a weak December, with the
boost coming from a $300 million upgrade to an automotive assembly
plant in Louisville KY.  Residential building, at $118.8 billion (annual rate), dropped 7%
in January after showing modest improvement during the previous
five months. Single family housing held steady in January, as the
result of varied behavior by geography, with growth in the South
Central (up 6%) and the South Atlantic (up 5%) offsetting declines
in the West (down 1%), the Midwest (down 1%), and the Northeast
(down 20%). The U.S. residential total in January was pulled down
by 35% decline for multifamily housing, which retreated after the
gains witnessed at the end of 2010. The largest multifamily
projects that reached groundbreaking in January were a $32 million
apartment building in Dallas TX, a $31 million apartment building
in Tysons Corner VA, and a $28 million apartment building
renovation project in St. Louis MO.  Nonbuilding construction in January advanced 2% to $166.3 billion
(annual rate). Highway and bridge construction soared 42%,
reflecting the lift coming from $1.5 billion for the start of work
to add new lanes to the LBJ Freeway in Dallas TX. Other large
highway and bridge projects reported as January starts included
$140 million for a freeway widening project in Placentia CA and
$114 million for work on the  New Jersey  Turnpike in Hamilton NJ.
Another substantial gain in January was posted by sewer
construction, rising 44% with the boost coming from $199 million
for the Euclid Creek Storage Tunnel project in Cleveland OH to
reduce combined sewer overflows. River/harbor development in
January climbed 35%, aided by $250 million for work related to
ongoing hurricane protection efforts in New Orleans LA, and the
miscellaneous public works category (site work and mass transit)
grew 29%. Water supply construction was the one public works
category in January to register a decline, sliding 38% after
December’s 27% gain. As for electric utilities, January showed a
reduced volume of construction starts relative to an exceptionally
strong December, as contracting fell 41%. January’s level of
electric utility construction was still strong by recent standards,
up 56% compared to the average monthly pace during 2010. The large
electric power plant projects reported as January starts included
two massive solar power facilities located in Blythe CA ($2.5
billion) and Ivanpah CA ($505 million).  The 4% decline for total construction on an unadjusted basis in
January 2011 relative to January 2010 was due to this performance
by major sector - nonresidential building, down 24%; residential
building, down 13%; and nonbuilding construction, up 30%. The
shortfall for nonresidential building reflected in part the
inclusion of the huge $3.0 billion transit hub in lower Manhattan
NY as a January 2010 start. If this project is excluded from the
January 2010 statistics, nonresidential building in January 2011
would be flat relative to last year, and total construction would
be up 6%. By region, total construction for January 2011 compared
to January 2010 revealed decreased activity in the Northeast, down
44%; and the South Atlantic, down 28%. Total construction gains on
a year-over-year basis were reported for the Midwest, up 1%; the
South Central, up 21%; and the West, up 37%.  Additional perspective can be obtained by looking at twelve-month
moving totals, in this case the twelve months ending January 2011
versus the twelve months ending January 2010, which lessens the
volatility present in one-month comparisons. For the twelve months
ending January 2011, total construction was down 2%, due to this
pattern by sector - nonresidential building, down 10%; residential
building, up 5%; and nonbuilding construction, up 3%. By region,
the twelve months ending January 2011 showed the following
behavior for total construction compared to the prior twelve
months - the South Atlantic, down 14%; the Northeast, down 4%; the
Midwest, unchanged; the South Central, up 1%; and the West, up 8%.
