The U.K. government has abandoned
plans to change the ownership of 258,000 hectares of publicly
owned English woodland, the Guardian reported.  Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman will announce
tomorrow that a consultation on the sale of woodland will be
terminated after a campaign of protest that united
environmentalists with politicians across the spectrum, the
newspaper said.   An online petition against the plans has been signed by
more than 531,000 people, the Guardian said.  Prime Minister  David Cameron  has told Spelman to set up an
independent panel with environmentalists to work out a consensus
on improving public access to forests and biodiversity in them,
the newspaper said.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
