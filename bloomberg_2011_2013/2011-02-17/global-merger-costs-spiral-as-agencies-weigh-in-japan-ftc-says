Mergers and acquisitions, such as  Panasonic Corp .’s 2008 bid to buy Sanyo Electric Co., face
spiralling legal costs as antitrust agencies across the world
seek to review deals, a Japanese regulator warned.  More than 100 competition agencies may now rule on large
international deals, said Akira Goto, a member of the  Japan Fair
Trade Commission .  The approval process is becoming “very costly for the
companies,” he told a conference at the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development in Paris today. “More
should be done on this front, some kind of international
cooperation, to reduce the burden.”  Panasonic, the world’s largest maker of plasma televisions,
paid about 10 billion yen ($120 million) to gain regulatory
approval from Japan, U.S.,  Europe ,  China  and other countries to
acquire Sanyo Electric, Goto said. The cash-and-stock
transaction values the battery maker at about 640 billion yen,
according to Bloomberg data.  The companies discussed remedies with four separate
competition agencies, Goto said. It took a year to complete the
deal after it was announced in December 2008. As well as legal
fees, translation also adds to the cost of winning approval for
deals, he said.  Panasonic spokesman  Akira Kadota  and the company’s press
office in Osaka didn’t respond to calls outside regular offices
hours.    Joaquin Almunia , the European Union’s antitrust
commissioner, has  said  his agency is also seeking ways to
bolster international cooperation in merger control.  To contact the reporter on this story:
