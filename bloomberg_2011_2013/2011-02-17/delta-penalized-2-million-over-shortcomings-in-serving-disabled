  Delta Air Lines Inc . was penalized
$2 million for its treatment of passengers with disabilities,
the largest fine assessed against an airline for a non-safety
violation, according to the U.S. Transportation Department.  Atlanta-based Delta, the world’s second-largest carrier,
must pay a $750,000 fine and spend an additional $1.22 million
on an automated wheelchair tracking system, customer service
surveys and compliance audits, according to the department order
released today in Washington.  The department during a review in 2007 and 2008 found “a
significant number” of violations of rules for serving disabled
passengers, several of them “egregious,” according to the
order. The department also said it found an “upward trend” in
the number of complaints since Delta was fined $1.3 million in
2003 for its treatment of disabled passengers.  “We take our aviation disability rules seriously and will
continue to enforce them vigorously,” Transportation Secretary
Ray LaHood said in a statement.  The department said it considers violations “egregious”
when a disabled passenger is left unattended on an airplane for
more than 15 minutes after others exit or left for more than 30
minutes in a terminal; or when a carrier fails to provide a
wheelchair or assistance.  “We take the responsibility of serving customers with
disabilities seriously and have made significant investments in
technology, feedback assessment, and training since the issues
in 2007 and 2008 that the DOT cites,” Delta said in a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
