U.K. indexes tracking prices of
wheat used in  animal feed  and the grain for baking bread jumped
51 percent from a year earlier in December, the Department for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said.  A gauge that also includes barley and oats gained 49
percent, Defra said in a  report today . Feed-wheat futures traded
on NYSE Liffe in  London  surged 87 percent in 2010 after droughts
in Russia and Ukraine and excessive rainfall in Canada and
Australia hurt crops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
