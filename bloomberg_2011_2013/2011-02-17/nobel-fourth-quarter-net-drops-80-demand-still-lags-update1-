(Corrects first paragraph of Feb. 17 story to show Nobel is
second-biggest by sales.)  Nobel Biocare Holding AG (NOBN) , the
second-biggest dental implant maker by sales, reported an 80
percent drop in fourth-quarter profit as demand still lags
behind the economic recovery.  Net income dropped to 5.2 million euros ($7.1 million) from
26 million euros a year earlier, the Glattbrugg, Switzerland
based-company said in a statement today. The earnings missed the
average estimate of 9.27 million euros from 10 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg.  Flagging demand for complex and expensive treatments hurt
sales, Chief Executive Officer Domenico Scala said in a
telephone interview today. Nobel Biocare, which is introducing
three new products this year, expects to return to “at least
market growth” in the next six months while the overall market
should see mid-single-digit growth this year. The shares rose
4.8 percent.  “While our financial performance was disappointing in
2010, the operational progress and investments in growth have
laid the foundation for a more promising 2011,” Scala said in a
statement. He will be replaced by Richard Laube, a former  Nestle
SA (NESN)  executive, as of May 1, the company announced yesterday.  The company said it’s targeting an earnings before interest
and taxes margin of 18 percent for 2011, compared with 14.7
percent in 2010.  Nobel Biocare rose 92 centimes to 19.97 francs at the close
of Zurich trading. The stock has fallen 27 percent in the past
year, including reinvested dividends, compared with a 9.1
percent return for the Stoxx 600 Health Care Index.  Lower Dividend  Sales fell 1.6 percent to 153.2 million euros, short of the
157.5 million-euro average estimate from 16 analysts polled by
Bloomberg. The company proposed a dividend of 35 centimes a
share, compared with 55 centimes a share in 2009.  “The issue is their geographic exposure,” said Lisa B. Clive, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., who rates the
stock “market perform.” She said the company’s limited
business in  Germany  and large presence in  Spain  “will continue
to hurt them in 2011 as Germany is going to be the strongest
market in  Europe  and Spain will still be weak.”  Sales in the  North America  declined 9.2 percent during the
quarter following recent management changes there, while rivals
had growth, Clive said.  Straumann Holding AG is the largest maker of dental
implants, based on 2010 sales in Swiss francs, using exchange
rates as of Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
