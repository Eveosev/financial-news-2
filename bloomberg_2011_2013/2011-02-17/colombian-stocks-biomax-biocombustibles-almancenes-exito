The following companies had unusual
price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in

fuel distributor, rose the most in a month, climbing 2 percent
to 1,830 pesos. The company said it bought a 94 percent stake in
competing fuel service station company Brio de Colombia SA for
137.9 billion pesos ($72.8 million).    Almacenes Exito SA  (EXITO CB), the country’s largest
publicly traded retailer, dropped the most in two weeks,
retreating 1.3 percent to 23,500 pesos. Colombian truckers, in a
bid to pressure the government to maintain freight fees, blocked
roads across the country as part of a two-week strike that may
ratchet up inflation. Given the difficulties in transportation,
“many” farm goods producers opted to not bring their goods to
market today, the Agriculture Ministry said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
