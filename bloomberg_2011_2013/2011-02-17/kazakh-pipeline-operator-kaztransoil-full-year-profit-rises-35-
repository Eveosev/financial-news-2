AO KazTransOil, the Kazakh pipeline
operator of state-owned  KazMunaiGaz National Co. , boosted profit
by 35 percent to 21 billion tenge ($143 million) in 2010.  Revenue rose 10 percent from a year earlier to 138 billion
tenge, Astana-based KazTransOil said in an e-mailed statement
today. Growth was bolstered by increasing oil shipments and an
improved shipping rate, the company said, without saying what
the rate is.  To contact the reporter on this story:
