  CEZ AS , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
power producer, may say full-year profit fell as global
electricity prices remained below last year’s level.  Net income in 2010 probably dropped 6.6 percent to 48.5
billion koruna ($2.7 billion) from 51.9 billion koruna a year
earlier, according to an average estimate by 11 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  The Prague-based utility announced a cost-saving plan and
scaled back investments in neighboring countries of central and
eastern  Europe  while concentrating on refurbishing coal plants
in the home market. CEZ plans to add two nuclear reactors to its
Temelin power plant this decade and will choose the winner of
the tender in 2013.  Earnings before interest and tax probably fell 6.3 percent
to 63.9 billion koruna, while sales rose 1.2 percent to 198.6
billion koruna because of an uptick in demand at the end of the
year, the survey shows.  CEZ is scheduled to release the full-year earnings report
on Feb. 28 before trading begins on the Prague Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
