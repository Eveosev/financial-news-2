Diamondback Capital Management LLC,
among the  hedge funds  raided in November as part of a government
insider-trading probe, received withdrawal requests of about
$1.3 billion for the end of March, according to an investor
letter.  The redemptions equal 23 percent of the firm assets,
Diamondback co-founders Rich Schimel and Lawrence Sapanski said
in an investor letter today. The Stamford, Connecticut-based
hedge fund manages about $5.8 billion.  Diamondback said the Nov. 22 raid by the  Federal Bureau of
Investigation  was focused on one of its portfolio managers, who
was put on leave. The firm said it was told by the government
that itâ€™s not the target of the investigation. Hedge funds Level
Global Investors LP and Barai Capital Management LP told clients
they were closing after their offices were raided.    Steve Bruce , a spokesman for Diamondback, declined to
comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
