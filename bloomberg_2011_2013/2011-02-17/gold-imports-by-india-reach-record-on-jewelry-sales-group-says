Gold imports by  India , the largest
user, climbed to a record in 2010, driven by a surge in jewelry
demand and amid expectations that the 10-year rally in prices
would extend, according to the  World Gold Council .  Purchases totaled 918 metric tons, according to provisional
data released by the producer-funded group today. That exceeds
the projection of about 800 tons made last month by Ajay Mitra,
the group’s managing director for India and the Middle East.  Bullion advanced 30 percent last year, reaching a record
$1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7, as investors bought the metal as a
protector of wealth. Jewelry demand in India jumped 69 percent
in the year to the highest ever, helping drive global demand to
a 10-year peak, according to the council.  “India was the strongest growth market in 2010,” said the
report. “The rising price of gold, particularly in the latter
half of the year, created a ‘virtuous circle’ of higher price
expectations among Indian consumers, which fuelled purchases,
thereby further driving up local prices.”  Fourth-quarter imports rose to 265 tons from 204 tons a
year earlier, the group said. Jewelry demand gained 47 percent
to 210.5 tons, while total demand in the period climbed 37
percent to 284.9 tons.  Consumer demand for bullion in India rallied 66 percent in
2010 to 963.1 tons by volume from a year earlier and more than
doubled in value to $38.2 billion, the council said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
