The  Cleveland Cavaliers  handed the
National Basketball Association champion  Los Angeles  Lakers
their third straight defeat, five days after ending a league-
record 26-game losing streak.  Ramon Sessions came off the bench to score a season-high 32
points as the Cavaliers won 104-99 at the Quicken Loans Arena in
Cleveland. The Lakers thrashed the Cavaliers 112-57 last month.  Cleveland last year had an NBA-best 61-21 regular-season
record with LeBron James winning a second straight Most Valuable
Player award. Since he signed with the  Miami Heat  as a free
agent in July, the Cavaliers have slumped to 10-46 for last
place in the league. The Lakers -- who are seeking a third
straight NBA title -- are sixth in the standings at 38-19. The  San Antonio Spurs  lead the nation with a 46-9 mark.  “I’m not that worried,” Lamar Odom, who had six points for
the Lakers, told reporters. “I think it’s things we can fix.”  Kobe Bryant, who has a career average of 25.3 points in 15
seasons with the Lakers, was limited to 17 points and had seven
turnovers last night. Pau Gasol led Los Angeles with 30 points
and 20 rebounds, and Derek Fisher had 19 points.  The Cavaliers ended their losing streak with a 126-119
overtime win against the  Los Angeles Clippers  on Feb. 11.
Cleveland’s run of 26 losses set an NBA record and tied the
National Football League’s Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 1976 and 1977
for the longest losing streak in major U.S. sports.  The Lakers have lost five more games than at the same stage
last season and nine more than in the season before that. Lakers
General Manager Mitch Kupchak told NBA.com Jan. 31 that “our
performance is not living up to our talent level.”  After opening a seven-game road trip 4-0, the Lakers four
days ago lost 89-75 to the Orlando Magic before sustaining their
biggest defeat of the season, by 20 points, to the Charlotte
Bobcats the following day.  The Lakers resume their schedule two days after the Feb. 20
All-Star Game at home against the  Atlanta Hawks .  Cleveland  hosts
the Houston Rockets Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
