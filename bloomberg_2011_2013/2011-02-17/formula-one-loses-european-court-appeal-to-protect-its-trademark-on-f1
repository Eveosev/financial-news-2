Formula One Group lost a court
challenge of a decision that gave another company the European
Union-wide rights to a trademark that includes the words
“F1-Live.”  The  EU General Court , the 27-nation EU’s second-highest
tribunal, today rejected the appeal, ruling that “there is no
likelihood of confusion between the mark applied for and Formula
One Licensing’s marks given the low degree of similarity.”  Racing-Live, a motor sports website based in Montpellier,  France , won a  challenge  in 2008 when the EU trademark agency
backed its bid to trademark an image with the words F1-Live in
it. That was the same year the company, which had been seeking
that trademark since 2004, was acquired by ESPN Inc.  The group in charge of licensing for Formula One, the
world’s most-watched motor sport, in 2005 challenged the French
company’s application and had won the EU trademark agency’s
backing that such a trademark would be confused with the group’s
existing F1 trademarks. Formula One appealed to the EU court
when the agency overturned that ruling in 2008.  The Luxembourg-based EU court today ruled that the region’s
trademark agency “was correct” in finding that F1 in ordinary
typeset has a weak distinctive character. People won’t make a
connection between the two trademarks “because of its totally
different layout,” said the court.  The case is T-10/09, Formula One Licensing v OHIM - Racing
- Live (F1-Live).  To contact the reporter on this story:
