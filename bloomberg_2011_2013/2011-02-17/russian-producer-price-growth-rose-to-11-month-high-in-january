Russian producer prices, an early
indicator of inflation, increased in January at the fastest rate
in 11 months, led by the mining sector.  Prices of goods leaving factories and mines jumped an
annual 19.4 percent in January, growing for a 15th consecutive
month, after a 16.7 percent rise a month earlier, the  Federal
Statistics Service  in Moscow said in an e-mailed statement
today. The median forecast of eight economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was for an increase of 18.7 percent.  Factory-gate prices climbed 2.1 percent from the previous
month after a 1 percent monthly rise in December, the service
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
