Roberto Carlos,  Brazil ’s former
World Cup-winning left back, joined Russian soccer club Anzhi
Makhachkala after leaving Corinthians by mutual consent.  The 37-year-old signed a 2 1/2-year contract, Anzhi
Makhachkala said on its  website  last night, without giving
financial details of the deal. He was offered 15 million reais
($9 million) a year, Sao Paulo-based Corinthians said on their
website Feb. 12.  Roberto Carlos, who played on three World Cup teams for
Brazil including the 2002 champions, spent 15 years in Italy,  Spain  and Turkey before joining Corinthians in December 2009. He
said in a December interview that he no longer needed to seek
out bigger checks abroad.  His most successful spell at club level came during an 11-
year stint at Real  Madrid , where he won three Champions League
and four Spanish league titles.  Anzhi Makhachkala, based in the southern Russian republic
of Dagestan, finished 11th in Russia’s 16-team Premier League
last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
