  RBC Capital Markets , the investment-
banking arm of Canada’s biggest lender, said U.S. fixed-income
sales head Chuck Powis has left the firm.  No decision has been made about whether he will be
replaced, said Kevin Foster, a New York-based spokesman for RBC
Capital. Product sales managers will report directly to Jonathan Hunter, global co-head of currencies and fixed income in New
York, Foster said. Powis, who was based in New York, couldn’t be
reached for comment by phone.    Royal Bank of Canada ’s fiscal fourth-quarter profit
unexpectedly declined 9.4 percent to C$1.12 billion ($1.14
billion), or 74 cents a share, on rising costs for compensation
and marketing and falling trading revenue. Toronto-based Royal
Bank’s trading income plunged by half, while its international
unit posted its 10th-straight quarterly loss, the company
reported Dec. 3. It will next report results on March 3.  Powis was named head of institutional sales for U.S.
financial products,  fixed income  and currencies in September
2007. He was previously head of U.S. structured credit and
rates.  To contact the reporters on this story:
