The Swiss franc extended its advance
against the euro and the dollar after Iranian state-run Press TV
said the Persian Gulf nation is sending two warships to use the  Suez Canal .  The franc strengthened 0.8 percent to 1.2914 per euro as of
1:52 p.m. in  London , and appreciated 0.7 percent versus the
dollar to 95.25 centimes.  Iranian officials were in contact with Egyptian authorities
to arrange passage for the vessels, and Egypt believes there is
nothing wrong with the journey, the report said, citing an
unidentified naval official, which it described as confirming
reports of the shipsâ€™ itineraries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
