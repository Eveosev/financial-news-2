  Ghana ’s President John Atta Mills
pledged to “account for every pesewa” of the country’s new-
found oil wealth as he outlined road, rail and energy projects
aimed at raising  living standards .  “We have a lot of planning to do to raise the living
conditions of our people,” Mills told parliament in a state-of-
the-nation address in the capital, Accra, today. “I want to
assure the people of Ghana the oil revenue will be used for
their benefit.”  The government will complete a new gas transfer station in
the western city of Takoradi, begin work on a number of highway,
railroad and irrigation projects and take steps to repay
longstanding debts from the state-owned Tema Oil Refinery.
Ghana’s Jubilee oil field, which began production in December,
is expected to increase output to 120,000 barrels per day within
three to six months from 55,000 barrels last month, according to  Tullow Oil Plc , the field’s operator.  Mills also called for the country’s politicians to damp
political rhetoric to preserve the country’s democracy.  “For those who are interested in warmongering, I want to
tell them that their agenda will never see the light of day,”
he said.  Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu, opposition leader for the New
Patriotic Party, called Mills’ address the “most divisive”
presidential speech to parliament in the country’s history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
