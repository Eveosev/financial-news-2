Cotton topped $2 a pound for the
first time ever as accelerating global growth boosted demand for
garments manufactured in  China , the world’s biggest fiber
consumer and importer, amid shrinking supplies.  China’s apparel exports in January surged 34 percent to
$13.38 billion from a year earlier, the Customs Bureau said this
week. Cotton stockpiles monitored by ICE Futures U.S. have
plunged 84 percent since June 1, and flooding in Australia and  Pakistan  reduced output.  “The bulls have gone berserk, and it looks like they want
prices to go higher,” said Sid Love, the president of Joe Kropf
&  Sid Love  Consulting Services LLC in  Overland Park ,  Kansas .
“China’s demand still remains strong.”  In other markets, silver surged to a 30-year peak and gold
climbed to a one-month high as rising consumer prices boosted
investor demand for precious metals as an inflation hedge. Corn
also gained. The UBS Bloomberg Constant Maturity Commodity Index
advanced 0.4 percent to 1,713.06.  Cotton for May delivery rose by the exchange limit of 7
cents, or 3.6 percent, to settle at a record $2.0193 on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York . The contract with the highest open
interest has more than doubled in the past 12 months and
quadrupled in two years.  Cotton for March delivery jumped by the maximum to $2.0402.  Silver, Gold  Silver futures for March delivery rose 94.1 cents, or 3.1
percent, to close at $31.57 an ounce on the Comex in New York.
After the settlement, the metal reached $31.79, the highest
since March 1980. The price has almost doubled in the past year.  Gold futures for April delivery climbed $10, or 0.7
percent, to $1,375.10 an ounce. After the settlement, the price
reached $1,385.80, the highest since Jan. 13. The metal has
gained 24 percent in the past 12 months.  The U.S. cost of living climbed in January for a seventh
month, the government said today. The U.K. consumer-price index
rose to a 26-month high last month, a report this week showed.
Gold climbed to a record in December as the  Federal Reserve  kept
U.S. borrowing costs low.  “Silver will pull gold higher,” said  Frank McGhee , the
head dealer at Integrated Brokerage Services LLC in  Chicago .
“The market has turned its attention to geopolitical fear, food
inflation and the Fed not changing its stance.”  Corn  Corn rose to a 31-month high on signs that global demand is
increasing for supplies from the U.S., the world’s largest
grower and exporter.  U.S. export sales in the week ended Feb. 10 were 15 percent
above the average of the previous four weeks, the government
said today.  Sales  topped 1 million tons for the third straight
week, the longest stretch since June. The leading buyer was
Mexico after freezing weather  damaged  crops.  “Demand continues to show improvement,” said  Mark
Schultz , the chief analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co.
in  Minneapolis .   Mexico ’s crop losses spurred fresh U.S.
sales.”  Corn futures for May delivery rose 22 cents, or 3.1
percent, to $7.23 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.
