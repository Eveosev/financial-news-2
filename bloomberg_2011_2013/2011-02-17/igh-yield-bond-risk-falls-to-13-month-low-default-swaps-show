  Bahrain  led an increase in the cost
of insuring Middle Eastern sovereign debt on concern escalating
unrest will destabilize the  Persian Gulf , where most of the
region’s oil is produced.  Credit-default swaps on Bahrain jumped for a fourth day,
rising 18.5 basis points to 286, the highest since July 2009,
according to CMA. Swaps on Egypt rose to the highest in more
than a week as protests continued after last week’s resignation
of President  Hosni Mubarak .  Pro-democracy protesters in Bahrain, home to the U.S.
Navy’s Fifth Fleet, stepped up demands for the government to
resign after a security crackdown overnight that left at least
three people dead. Egypt’s banks and stock market remain shut
with no official date to reopen.  “Protests are becoming more geopolitical,” said Gabriel Sterne, an emerging-market economist at brokerage Exotix Ltd. in
London. “The fact that it’s spread to wealthy countries makes
it look like it’s more a cry for democracy rather than
economic.”    Egypt ’s army urged people to return to daily life, saying
protests are hurting the economy and threaten to weaken
security. Finance Minister Samir Radwan said yesterday that more
than two weeks of unrest cost the economy $310 million a day, as
tourists shunned the country.  ‘Patience Wears Thin’  “Up to now, investors have been rather patient and
optimistic for the medium-term outlook for Egypt but the longer
the disruption goes on, that patience wears thin,” Sterne said.
“From an investor’s perspective, there’s been a disappointing
follow up in Egypt with strikes continuing.”  Swaps on Egypt rose 5 basis points to 350, the highest in
more than a week, according to CMA. Contracts on  Israel 
increased 3 basis points to 146, Lebanon rose 4 to 351, Dubai
added 5 basis points to 422.5, Qatar was 3 higher at 103 and  Saudi Arabia  was up 4 at 126.  The cost of insuring European corporate debt was little
changed. Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 50
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings were unchanged
at 390 basis points, after earlier falling to the lowest since
January 2010, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 0.75 basis point to 96.75. The
Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks and insurers rose 0.5
basis point to 159 and the subordinated index was 5 lower at
269.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($13.6 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
