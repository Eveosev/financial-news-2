The  European Central Bank  awarded
the contract for the remaining structural work on its new
Frankfurt headquarter to construction company Ed Zueblin AG.  “The company has committed to completing the structural
works for the new ECB premises as planned, in terms of timing,
cost and quality,” the ECB said in a statement today.  The ECB last week announced construction firm Baresel GmbH
would complete structural work on the new premises only up to
the ground floor. Ed Zueblin was ranked second in the
procurement for the construction work on the double-tower
structure, the ECB said today.  “The date of completion of the new premises remains
unchanged for the end of 2013,” the ECB said, adding it expects
to move into the building in early 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
