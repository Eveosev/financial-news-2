Pakistan State Oil Co., the
country’s biggest fuel retailer, said it stopped supplies to
three power companies after they delayed payments for purchases
of diesel and furnace oil.  “The decision to cut off supplies, which amount to
approximately 23,000 metric tons on a daily basis, has come
after a series of deliberations by the top management,” the
company said in a statement today.  Water & Power Development Authority , the country’s biggest
state utility,  Hub Power Co . and Kot Addu Power Co. owe a
combined 149.4 billion rupees ($1.8 billion), Pakistan State Oil
said in the statement. Total dues stand at 158.65 billion
rupees, the company said.  Pakistan State Oil posted an increase in second-quarter
profit after prices of furnace oil rose. The fuel retailer needs
funds to pay refiners for purchases.  “Pakistan State Oil is on the verge of impending default
and had been supplying uninterrupted fuel to the power sector to
responsibly meet the energy requirements of the nation,” the
company said. The last payment from power companies was received
on Jan. 7, Pakistan State Oil said.  The retailer’s net income in the three months ended Dec. 31
doubled to 6.32 billion rupees from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
