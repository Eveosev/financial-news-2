  Nigeria  plans to establish
commercial courts to hear such cases as bank fraud and loan
defaults, the local  Guardian  reported.  The courts will ensure speedy settlements of such matters
and help improve stability in the banking system, the Lagos-
based newspaper said, citing Kingsley Moghalu, one of deputy
governors of the  Central Bank of Nigeria .  A draft bill for the creation of the courts has been sent
to parliament for approval, Moghalu said, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
