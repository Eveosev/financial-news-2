A  Weight Watchers International Inc .
options investor earned a three-day paper profit of about $8.2
million after the stock surged the most ever today following the
company’s higher-than-estimated forecast.  A block of 4,273 February $45 calls was purchased for 95
cents each on Feb. 14, when the stock closed at $44.08. Calls
give the right to buy 100 shares, meaning the contracts cost
about $400,000. The Weight Watchers calls jumped 1,397 percent
to $20.21 at 4 p.m. New York time today, driving their value up
to $8.6 million.  Weight Watchers surged 46 percent to a record $65.39 after
the New York-based operator of diet centers said 2011 earnings
will rise to $3.50 to $3.85 a share. Analysts projected $2.77,
the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “It was either the luckiest trade in a year and a half or
it was someone who had inside information,” said Ophir Gottlieb, head of client services at Livevol Inc., a San
Francisco-based provider of options market analytics. He cited
the choice of a contract that was the closest out-of-the-money
call to the stock price, and the options having an open interest
more than quadruple the size of any other contract.  Corey Kinger, a Weight Watchers spokeswoman, didn’t return
a telephone call requesting comment.  The stock move had a statistical probability of less than
one in a million based on the implied volatility levels before
today, according to a report from  Henry Schwartz , president of
Trade Alert LLC, a New York-based provider of options-market
data and analytics.  Call Volume  Overall call volume surged to a 20-month high this week
before the company’s earnings report today. Trading of calls to
buy the stock jumped to 7,008 contracts Feb. 14, compared with
13 puts to sell that changed hands that day and average daily
call volume of 505 contracts in the prior four weeks.  The February $45 calls had an open interest of 7,401
contracts before today, the largest of all Weight Watchers
contracts and about a third of all 21,756 contracts. The Feb. 14
trade helped boost open interest for calls to 15,681 from 9,264
the day before.  “The size and unusual nature of the call purchase
definitely arouses some suspicion with it coming just three days
ahead of earnings,” said Joe Kunkle, founder of
OptionsHawk.com, a Boston-based provider of options market
analytics. “But it also may have been someone protecting a
large short position.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
