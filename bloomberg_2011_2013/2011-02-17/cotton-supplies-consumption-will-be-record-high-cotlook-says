Cotton production will exceed demand
by 1.2 million metric tons in the 2011-12 season that starts
Aug. 1, making up for about a third of the shortage in supplies
for the past two years, industry researcher  Cotlook Ltd.  said.  Global output will jump 13 percent to a record 27.65
million tons as demand climbs 4.4 percent to an all-time high of
26.4 million tons, Birkenhead, England-based Cotlook said today
in its first estimates for the new season. Shortages the past
two years reduced stockpiles by 3.5 million tons, Cotlook said,
pushing prices to a record high.  “The world stockpile situation isn’t going to turn around
overnight,” said  Matt Robinson , a Cotlook director. “It would
still be a reasonable assumption that we would see some
reduction in prices.”  Cotton prices jumped to a record $2.0193 a pound in  New
York  today as textile mills from Indonesia to  Turkey  bought back
futures to fix a price against the March futures contract which
has a first notice on Feb. 22, Robinson said.  In  China , the world’s biggest producer and consumer of the
fiber, production will increase 15 percent to 7.1 million tons,
below demand of 10.5 million tons, Cotlook said. In the U.S.,
production will expand 5.4 percent to 4.2 million tons,
according to the company. U.S. demand will be 827,000 tons, up
4.9 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
