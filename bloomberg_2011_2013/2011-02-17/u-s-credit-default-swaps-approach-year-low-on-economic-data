The cost of protecting U.S.
investment-grade corporate bonds from default approached a one-
year low as an index of U.S. leading indicators rose in January
and manufacturing in the Philadelphia region accelerated.  The Markit CDX North America Investment Grade Index, which
investors use to hedge against losses on corporate debt or to
speculate on creditworthiness, fell 1.2 basis points to a mid-
price of 79.3 basis points as of 5:02 p.m. in New York,
according to index administrator Markit Group Ltd.  In a sign that the economic expansion will extend into this
year, the Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months increased 0.1 percent after rising 0.8
percent in December, the New York-based group said today. The
Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index
rose to 35.9, the highest level since January 2004 and exceeding
the median forecast of 21 in a Bloomberg News survey of
economists.  The credit swaps index, which typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates, decreased to a
one-year low of 79 on Feb. 8 from 99.4 on Nov. 30.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
