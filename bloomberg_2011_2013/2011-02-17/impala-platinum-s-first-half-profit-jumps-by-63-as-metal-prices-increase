  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd ., the
second-largest producer of the metal, posted a 63 percent jump
in first-half profit as it sold more of the precious metal at
higher prices and said it sees the potential for further
earnings growth.  Net income rose to 2.07 billion rand ($286 million) in the
six months to Dec. 31, from 1.27 billion rand a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. Impala
will pay a dividend of 1.50 rand a share for the period during
which gross platinum output rose 6 percent to 952,000 ounces.  Earnings should improve “dramatically” given a weaker
local currency and expectations of further increases in the
price of platinum and related metals, Chief Executive Officer  David Brown  told reporters on a conference call today.  Platinum gained 24 percent to an average $1,627.14 an ounce
in London in the period under review, from $1,314.36 a year
earlier. Impala didn’t get the full benefit of the increase in
prices because the local currency appreciated 11 percent against
the dollar. The rand has since weakened 8.4 percent. Impala
mainly sells metal in dollars, and its costs are mostly in rand.  Shares in Impala fell 0.2 percent to 213 rand at the close
of trading in Johannesburg, giving the company a value of 134.6
billion rand.  Anglo Platinum Ltd ., the largest producer, gained
0.1 percent to 712 rand. The two companies mine most of their
platinum, used in vehicle emission control devices and jewelry,
in  South Africa .  Tempered Jewelry Demand  Global platinum demand may rise 3.3 percent to 7.93 million
ounces this year, boosting prices to between $1,725 and $1,920
an ounce, Derek Engelbrecht, Impala’s head of marketing, said on
a webcast from Johannesburg today. Demand for platinum will grow
as sales of heavy-duty diesel vehicles increase, he said. Demand
from the jewelry industry “may be tempered” at the expected  price levels , Engelbrecht said.  For palladium, “an extremely bullish picture is starting
to emerge, he said. Last year’s estimated global palladium
shortfall of about 460,000 ounces may widen to 560,000 ounces
this year, Engelbrecht said. That may boost prices to between
$775 and $950 an ounce from an average of $529 in  London  last
year, he said.  Impala is planning about 29 billion rand of capital
expenditure over the next four years as Brown looks to boost
production of the precious metals. The CEO may seek board
approval for a shaft and concentrator at the Leeuwkop project in
South Africa later this year, and may also go ahead with the so-
called Shaft 18 project within about 12 to 15 months, he said on
the webcast.  Impala may also consider a third expansion project in  Zimbabwe , where a second is already under way at a ‘‘rough’’
cost of between $200 million and $300 million.  To contact the reporters on this story:
