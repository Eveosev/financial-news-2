  Colombia ’s President  Juan Manuel Santos  said peace talks with the biggest rebel group would only
be possible if it abandons terrorism, according to an e-mailed
 statement .  “The key is not at the bottom of the sea, but the door is
closed, and it will only be opened when there’s proof that the
FARC is willing and that it won’t cheat us, that it will give up
terrorism,” Santos said.  The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia urged Santos
Feb. 6 to take advantage of its goodwill gesture of freeing
hostages to seek a political solution to the country’s half-
century armed conflict.  To contact the reporter on this story:
