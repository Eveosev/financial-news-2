Cyril Stein, widely regarded as the
architect behind the success of bookmakers  Ladbrokes Plc , died
at the age of 82, the London-based  Times  reported.  Stein, born and raised in Londonâ€™s East End, became
involved in the bookmaking business soon after leaving school
and with his uncle Max Stein, acquired Ladbrokes for 100,000
pounds ($161,000) in 1956 and after building up the company,
sold shares on the  London  Stock Exchange in 1967, which valued
it at just over 1 million pounds, the newspaper said.  By the time he stepped down in 1993 Ladbrokes was worth 2
billion pounds and had ventured into hotels, holiday centers and
bingo halls, the Times said.  Stein once described betting as a business with three
windows taking money in and only one paying it out.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:  Chris Peterson  at
