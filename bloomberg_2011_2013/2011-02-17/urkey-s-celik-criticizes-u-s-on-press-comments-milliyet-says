U.S. Ambassador Francis J.
Riccardione crossed the line by commenting on the arrests of
journalists in  Turkey ,  Milliyet  newspaper cited ruling Justice
and Development Party spokesman Huseyin Celik as saying.  “Ambassadors can’t design our policies,” Milliyet quoted
Celik as saying at a press conference in Ankara yesterday.
“There’s a line, and whether it’s the U.S. ambassador or the
Russian ambassador, they have to stay behind that line.”  Riccardione told Turkish journalists that the U.S. was
trying to understand a Feb. 14 raid on the offices of a news
website critical of the government, suggesting it didn’t match
with Turkey’s public support for freedom of the press, Milliyet
reported yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
