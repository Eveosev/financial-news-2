The cost of protecting Asian
corporate and government bonds from non-payment fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 0.5 basis point to 106.5 as of 8:35
a.m. in Beijing, according to Credit Agricole CIB prices. The
index is heading for its lowest level since Feb. 8, according to
CMA prices in  New York .  The Markit iTraxx Australia index declined 2 basis points
to 105 as of 11:06 a.m. in Sydney, according to Nomura Holdings
Inc. prices. The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell half a basis
point to 101.5 as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Deutsche
Bank AG prices.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on  credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  --Henry Sanderson. Editor: Tom Kohn  To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:  Henry Sanderson  in Beijing at 86-10-6649-7548 or
