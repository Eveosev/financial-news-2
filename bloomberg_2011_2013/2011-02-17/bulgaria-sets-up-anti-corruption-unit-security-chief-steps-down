Bulgaria set up a Center for
Prevention of Organized Crime and Corruption in an effort to
clear its image as the  European Union’s  second-most corrupt
country after  Greece .  The center will work together with similar units in the
police and the State Agency for National Security, which is the
equivalent of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, Prime
Minister  Boiko Borissov , told reporters in Sofia today. The unit
will be headed by Roumen Milanov, Borissov’s security adviser.  Borissov also said he accepted the resignation of national
security agency chief Tsvetlin Yovchev over his failure to
prevent leakage of taped phone conversations to the media, in
which Customs Office chief Vanyo Tanov complains to senior
government officials about pressure on his office to protect
certain companies from tax investigations.  Borissov took office 18 months ago, pledging to curb
corruption and organized crime after criticism from the European
Commission. The leaked tapes prompted a confidence vote in
Parliament on Jan. 20, which he won. The Brussels-based
commission is expected to assess Bulgaria efforts to fight graft
in an interim report at the end of this month.  Bulgaria ranks among the most corrupt countries in the EU
including Greece, Romania and  Italy  in a corruption perception
index by  Transparency International , a Berlin-based watchdog.  To contact the reporter on this story:
