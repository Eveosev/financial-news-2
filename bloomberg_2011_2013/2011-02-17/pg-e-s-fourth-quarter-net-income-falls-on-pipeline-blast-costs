  PG&E Corp ., owner of a natural-gas
pipeline that exploded in September, said fourth-quarter
profit fell because of costs related to the blast.  Net income fell to $250 million, or 63 cents a share, from
$273 million, or 71 cents, a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said today in a statement on PR Newswire.  Federal investigators have yet to determine the cause of
rupture on a PG&E gas line that killed eight people and
destroyed 37 homes in San Bruno, California. A piece of pipe
removed from the scene had several defective welds, the  National
Transportation Safety Board  said in a report last month.  Federal and state regulators have ordered PG&E to verify
how much pressure can be placed on system after discovering PG&E
had inaccurate records on its damaged pipeline. PG&E’s data
showed that the section was made without seams while
investigators found that it had some welded segments, which is a
weaker construction.  PG&E, owner of  California ’s largest utility, operates more
than 6,700 miles of gas transmission lines.  The statement was issued before the start of regular
trading on U.S. stock markets. PG&E fell 21 cents to $46
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The
stock, which has 9 buy recommendations from analysts and 9
holds, has fallen 3.9 percent this year.  (PG&E will hold an earnings conference call for investors
and analysts starting at 11:30 a.m. New York time. The call is
accessible on the company’s Web site at  http://www.pgecorp.com .)  To contact the reporter on this story:
