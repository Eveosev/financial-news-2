Former  Pinnacle Entertainment Inc .
Chief Executive Officer Daniel Lee won Louisiana’s last casino
license, beating two rival bidders including  Penn National
Gaming Inc .  The Louisiana Gaming Control Board today voted unanimously
to award the state’s 15th riverboat license to Lee’s Creative
Casinos LLC, which proposed a $400 million project called Mojito
Pointe in Lake Charles, next door to his former employer
Pinnacle’s  L’Auberge du Lac . The commission’s decision requires
local voter approval.  Pinnacle, the owner of seven U.S. casinos, surrendered the
license last year after scrapping plans to build a $350 million
casino resort, Sugarcane Bay, beside L’Auberge at a similar site
to Lee’s new project. Lee left Pinnacle, where he was chairman
and CEO, in November 2009.  Penn, the owner of 23 casinos and racetracks, had proposed
a suburban New Orleans riverboat which would have been located
about three miles from Pinnacle’s Boomtown casino. Louisiana
businessman William Trotter’s St. Gabriel Downs LLC had proposed
a Hard Rock Hotel & Casino in  Lake Charles .  Pinnacle fell as much as 9.6 percent after the decision,
and was down 3.9 percent to $13.62 at 12:27 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Penn fell as much as 2
percent, and was about 1 percent lower at $36.21 at 12:28 p.m.
in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
