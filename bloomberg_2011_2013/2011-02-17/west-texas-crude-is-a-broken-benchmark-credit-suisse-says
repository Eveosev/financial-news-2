West Texas Intermediate oil, the
grade traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , is a “broken
benchmark,” according to Credit Suisse AG.  Increasing Canadian and U.S. production has swollen
stockpiles at Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point for New York
futures, and depressed prices in relation to Brent oil on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange, New York-based
analysts Edward Morse and Joachim Azria said today in a report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
