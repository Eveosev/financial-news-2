  China ’s banking regulator ordered
the country’s lenders to reduce their reliance on the debt
grades given to companies by external ratings firms and focus
more on their own internal assessments to avoid systemic risks.  Banks should be prudent in using external ratings when
lending and mustn’t use them as their main decision-making
criteria, the China Banking Regulatory Commission said in a
 statement  on its website today. Banks should conduct due
diligence on the rating firms and be familiar with the
methodology.  China’s government has stepped up measures to manage risk
in the nation’s banking industry after financial institutions
lent an unprecedented 17.6 trillion yuan ($2.7 trillion) over
the past two years to support the world’s fastest-growing major
economy amid the global financial crisis.  When making major investments of their own, banks should
“on principle” rely on their own analysis for decision making,
the regulator said. They must refer to ratings from at least two
external credit rating companies and use the lowest debt grade
if there’s no internal rating available, according to the
regulator.  --Luo Jun, Zhang Dingmin. Editor: Andreea Papuc  To contact Bloomberg News staff of this story:
