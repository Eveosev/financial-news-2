  BNP Paribas  SA,  Europe ’s largest
bank, said fourth-quarter profit increased 14 percent, helped by
higher revenue at the investment bank and a rebound at the U.S.
consumer unit.  Net income rose to 1.55 billion euros ($2.1 billion) from
1.37 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based bank said in
a statement today. Earnings missed the 1.71 billion-euro average
estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg as it booked a
534-million-euro impairment on its stake in  Axa SA .  BNP Paribas seized takeover opportunities during the global
financial crisis, snapping up Fortis assets in Belgium and
Luxembourg in 2009 to become the largest bank in the euro region
by deposits. Chief Executive Officer Baudouin Prot said in an
interview that the bank will stick with its target for a return
on equity of 15 percent, a profitability goal he described as
challenging given tougher regulatory requirements. ROE was 12.3
percent in 2010.  “These are good results,” said Alex Koagne, a Paris-based
analyst at Natixis SA who has a “buy” rating on the stock.
“They keep delivering.”  BNP Paribas rose as much as 1.6 percent, and was up 89
cents, or 1.5 percent, to 59.86 euros by 9:34 a.m. in Paris
trading. The stock advanced 26 percent this year, compared with
a 30 percent increase in  Societe Generale  SA. BNP Paribas
outpaced its French competitor every year from 2007 through
2010.  Societe Generale, led by CEO Frederic Oudea, 47, said
yesterday that fourth-quarter net income quadrupled to 874
million euros, helped by a return to profit at its Russian unit
and fewer writedowns at the corporate and investment bank.  Return on Equity  BNP Paribas’s return on equity rose from 10.8 percent in
2009. Its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, a gauge of its
ability to absorb losses, was 9.2 percent at the end of
December, up from 8 percent a year before.    Credit Suisse Group AG  of Zurich, the second-largest Swiss
bank, lowered its target for return on equity this week to more
than 15 percent over the next three to five years from more than
18 percent, as tougher capital rules constrain earnings.  Barclays Plc  is aiming for an ROE of 13 percent, the London-
based bank said on Feb. 15, down from an average of 18 percent
over the past 30 years.  New rules drawn up by the  Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision  and endorsed by Group of 20 leaders last year will
require lenders to more than triple the highest-quality capital
they hold to cushion against losses to 7 percent of assets by
2019. Prot said in an interview in November he saw “absolutely
no reason whatsoever” that BNP Paribas should be asked to hold
an additional capital surcharge for too-big-to-fail banks.  Axa Impairment  “With its new size and reach, the group can utilize the
diversity of its businesses to adapt to the consequences of
regulatory changes,” Prot, 59, said in the statement.  BNP Paribas said the impairment charge on its Axa holding
“was deemed consistent with accounting rules and prudent”
because the stock has often traded below book value since the
start of the financial crisis. BNP Paribas valued its stake at
12.45 euros a share, the year-end market price. Axa rebounded at
the start of 2011, leaving BNP Paribas with a 364 million-euro
unrealized gain as of Jan. 31, the bank said.  Provisions for doubtful loans at BNP Paribas fell 43
percent in 2010 to 4.8 billion euros as the economic situation
improved, the bank said.  France, Belgium, Luxembourg and  Italy  represent most of the
bank’s revenue and the group also owns BancWest, a network of
about 730 branches in the U.S. Through the Fortis purchase, the
company also added clients in faster-growing economies such as
Turkey and  Poland .  Divisional Performance  Pretax profit at BNP Paribas’s corporate- and investment-
banking division rose 23 percent to 1.07 billion euros, compared
with analysts’ estimates of 1.14 billion euros. The bank plans
to improve its debt platform in the U.S. and develop its mergers
and acquisitions services there. In  Asia , the bank plans to
“bring in new talent” in  China ,  India  and  Korea . In Europe,
the investment bank aims to provide more advisory services for
M&A and rights issues, the company said.  Prot said in the interview that the bonus pool for 2010
will be smaller than in 2009, without elaborating.  Pretax earnings at the French consumer-banking unit rose 8
percent to 337 million euros. Profit before tax at BancWest
amounted to 156 million euros, compared with a 49 million-euro
loss.  The branch networks in Belgium and Luxembourg had a profit
of 119 million euros, a 29 percent increase from a year earlier.
BNP Paribas raised its goal for cost savings and revenue gains
from integrating the Fortis assets to 1.2 billion euros by 2012,
from a 900 million-euro forecast made in December 2009. The bank
also revised higher its estimate of the costs to integrate the
assets to 1.65 billion euros from 1.3 billion euros.  The Europe-Mediterranean unit, which includes retail-
banking networks in countries such as Turkey, Ukraine and  Egypt ,
had a 13 million-euro pretax profit, rebounding from a 91
million-euro loss a year earlier.  Pretax earnings at the investment-solutions unit, which
includes asset management, private banking and insurance, rose
41 percent to 547 million euros, helped by “a sharp rise in the
contribution of equity affiliates, especially in insurance.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
