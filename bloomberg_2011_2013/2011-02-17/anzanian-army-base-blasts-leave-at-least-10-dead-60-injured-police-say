At least 10 people died and 60 more
were injured in a series of explosions at a Tanzanian army-camp
warehouse yesterday near the commercial capital,  Dar es Salaam ,
the police said.  The cause of the explosions, which began at about 7 p.m.
and continued until about 9.30 p.m., is “likely to be
accidental,” Suleiman Kova, the regional police chief, said in a
phone interview today from the city. The blasts occurred at a
warehouse in the Gongo la Mboto camp, about 15 kilometers (9
miles) southwest of Dar es Salaam.  “The real cause is yet to be known, but this points to an
accident,” Kova said “I appeal to people to be calm at this time
when rescue efforts are being made.”  In April 2009, at least 11 people died in an explosion at a
weapons depot in the Mbagala military base southwest of Dar es
Salaam.  To contact the reporter on this story:
