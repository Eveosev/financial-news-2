Rolls-Royce Plc pulled out of the
race to supply engines for the Indian Air Force’s Jaguar jet
fighters after  India  said it wanted a completely new engine
instead of the upgraded Adourn MK811 the British firm was
proposing, the Daily Telegraph said, citing an unidentified
Rolls-Royce official.  The decision leaves Honeywell Inc. of the U.S. the only
bidder to supply engines for India’s 200 Anglo-French fighter-
bombers, the newspaper said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
