Oil options volatility decreased as
the underlying futures rose for a second day on a narrowing
spread between New York- and London-traded crude.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
April, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 27.9 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 28.8 percent yesterday.  Oil for March delivery gained $1.37, or 1.6 percent, to
settle at $86.36 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .
Futures have risen 12 percent in the past year.  June $70 puts were the most active options in electronic
trading today, with 2,912 lots changing hands. They dropped 4
cents to 27 cents a barrel. April $85 puts, the next-most active
contract, fell 48 cents to $1.10 a barrel with 1,516 contracts
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  March options expired at the close of Nymex floor trading
yesterday.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  May $100 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 8,103 lots changing hands. They gained 8 cents
to $1.24 a barrel. The next-most active option, April $90 calls,
increased 12 cents to $1.95 a barrel on 5,069 contracts.  Open interest was highest for April $100 calls with 44,476
contracts. Next were December $100 calls with 39,600 and
December $120 calls with 38,145.  To contact the reporter on this story:
