Scottish households face five more
years of economic misery as mortgage payments rise and the cost
of living increases, the Scotsman said, citing Stirling
University economist David Bell.  Spiralling mortgage costs, depressed wages and other higher
prices could be a permanent fixture in  Scotland  for at least
five years as a result of the economic crisis, the Scotsman
said. It would take a long time to get back to the living
standards of 2007, Bell told the newspaper.  Things will get worse before they got better and some
people could see mortgage repayments double if the  Bank of
England  increases  interest rates  by 1 percentage point, the
newspaper quoted Bell as saying. There were no reasons for
optimism, Bell told the Scotsman.  The prospects for growth were not strong and unemployment
wouldnâ€™t fall that fast without that growth. Public spending
cuts will also affect unemployment and the economy, Bell told
the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
