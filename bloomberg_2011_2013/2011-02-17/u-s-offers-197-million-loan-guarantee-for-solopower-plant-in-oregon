The U.S. Department of Energy
offered SoloPower Inc. a $197 million loan guarantee for a thin-
film solar panel factory the company plans to build in  Oregon .  The plant, to be located in Willsonville, is expected to
produce more than 400 megawatts of panels a year and employ up
to 500 people, the department said today in a statement.  SoloPower said in January that the plant would have
capacity of 300 megawatts, would cost $340 million and go into
operation in late 2011.  “Investments like these are going to help America become a
world leader again in clean energy manufacturing,” Energy
Secretary Steven Chu said in the statement.  SoloPower, based in  San Jose ,  California , deposits copper,
indium, gallium and di-selenide, or CIGS, onto rolls of flexible
materials to produce panels that it says are lighter than
conventional crystalline-silicon solar products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
