  BP Plc  will increase production
capacity of purified terephthalic acid in  China ’s Guangdong
Province, supplying manufacturers of bottles, textiles and films
in the world’s second-biggest economy.  The project will lift PTA capacity at the Zhuhai Chemical
Co. site to about 1.7 million tons a year from the current 1.5
million tons, the company said in an e-mailed statement in
London today. It expects the expansion to be fully operational
in the first quarter of next year. BP declined to say how much
the project will cost.  BP has invested more than  $5 billion in China  and
participates in oil and gas production, refining and marketing.
China last year overtook Japan to become the second-biggest
economy after the U.S.  “This investment will be the world’s largest single train
PTA plant, built in the world’s largest and fastest growing PTA
market with the world’s best and lowest cost technology,” Sue
Rataj, BP’s chief executive of petrochemicals, said in the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
