A strike by South African road
transport workers is beginning to limit Botswana’s food and fuel
supplies, local industry said.  “We might consider using rail if the strike continues
because we are cutting into the stock,” Mahube Mpugwa, general
manager of Puma Energy, formerly BP Botswana, said by phone
today.  Botswana depends on  South Africa  for about 80 percent of
its fuel supplies and 95 percent of its food shipments. The
strike by South African freight workers is now in its fourth
day, with the South African Petroleum Industry Association also
warning today that it faces “significant challenges” getting
fuel to filling stations.  South Africa’s Woolworths Holdings Ltd., which operates
food stores in Botswana, is experiencing delays in deliveries,
retail manager Dave Huggman told independent radio station, Gabz
FM today.  Stocks of some products are running low and the company is
considering using its own transporters, Huggman said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
