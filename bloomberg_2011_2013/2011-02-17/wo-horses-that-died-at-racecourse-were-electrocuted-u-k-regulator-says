Two horses that died at an English
race meeting last weekend were accidentally electrocuted, the
British Horseracing Authority said.  Fenix Two and Marching Song collapsed and died in the
parade ring at Newbury Racecourse in southwest  England  prior to
the first event on Feb. 12. The rest of the day’s schedule was
called off after the opening race.  “Findings from the investigation into the tragic incident
at Newbury last Saturday have confirmed accidental electrocution
was to blame for the deaths of two horses,” the BHA said  on its
website . “The decision from the BHA follows the receipt of
post-mortem reports and the results of sampling and information
from the racecourse and Southern Electric Power Distribution.”  The track has now been cleared by the authority to hold the
rescheduled event tomorrow. Newbury has told the BHA the parade
ring area is safe for use and that a cable previously located
within the parade ring area has been removed and disconnected.  “The authority has been officially informed that there was
leakage of electricity from a cable under the parade ring in the
area where the incident occurred,” Professor Tim Morris,
director of equine science and welfare for the BHA, told the
website.  Post-mortem examinations showed sudden cardiac arrest as
the cause of death, he said, and the findings were all
consistent with the cause of death being accidental
electrocution.  To contact the reporter on this story:
