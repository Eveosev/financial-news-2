Liberty Mutual Holding Co. Chief
Executive Officer Edmund “Ted” Kelly said U.S. inflation may
rise over the next five years as the government deficit
increases and Federal Reserve policies weaken the dollar.  “When we take a look out to 2014-15, which is where we have
to think, we’re convinced that the ingredients are in there”
for 8 or 9 percent inflation, Kelly said in an interview today
with  Carol Massar  and Matt Miller on Bloomberg Television’s
“Street Smart” program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
