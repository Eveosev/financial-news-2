The  Suez Canal  Authority’s head of
traffic Ahmed El Manakhly said that no Iranian warships have
been licensed to pass through the canal.  “Until now we don’t have any information or a license from
any ministry in Egypt,” he said in a phone interview today.    Iran  is sending two warships to use the Suez Canal, Iranian
state-run Press TV said, citing an unidentified naval official
whom it described as confirming reports of the ships’ itinerary.
He said Iranian officials were in contact with Egyptian
officials to arrange passage for the vessels, and that Egyptian
authorities believe there was nothing wrong with the journey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
