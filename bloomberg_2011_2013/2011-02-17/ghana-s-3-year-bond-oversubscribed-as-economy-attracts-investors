Ghana ’s auction of 400 million cedis
($265 million) of three-year bonds was oversubscribed by 88
percent as investors show confidence in the economy.  Investors bid a total of 753.7 million cedis for the offer,
which closed yesterday, according to Francis Andoh, head of
Ghana’s treasury. The bank sold 401.2 million cedis of the notes
at a 13.45 percent yield, he said.  “It shows investors are still confident about our economy
despite some challenges,” Andoh said in a telephone interview
today. “Foreign-based investors were predominant,” and their
purchases should strengthen the cedi, he said.  The cedi weakened 0.1 percent to 1.5110 per dollar at 1:38
p.m. in Accra, poised for the strongest closing level in a week,
according data compiled by Bloomberg.  The market should expect quarterly offerings of the debt,
Andoh said.  Ghana  issued the three-year bonds five times in
2010, with four sales oversubscribed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
