The  Bank of Israel , which has bought
dollars to weaken the shekel for three years, may let the
currency strengthen in the next few months to curb rising
inflation as economic growth accelerates, Citigroup Inc. said.  The shekel, which gained 2.1 percent this week before
today, slipped 0.1 percent to 3.6080 per dollar at 12:41 p.m. in
Tel Aviv. The currency climbed the most since Feb. 7 yesterday
after the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of Statistics  said the
economy grew 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter, the fastest pace
in four years. The consumer-price index increased an annual 3.6
percent, above the government’s 1 percent to 3 percent target
range, the agency said Feb. 15.  “The strength of domestic spending within the GDP data
will give the Bank of  Israel  pause for thought,”  David Lubin ,
London-based chief emerging markets economist at Citigroup,
wrote in an e-mailed report today. “A combination of decisive
rate hikes and a stronger shekel could both be needed to keep
inflationary expectations under control.”  Governor  Stanley Fischer  began buying foreign currency in
March 2008 and has more than doubled reserves since to a record
$73.4 billion at the end of January in a bid to shield an
economy reliant on exports. Fischer, who last month boosted the
interest rate to 2.25 percent, likely will raise the rate to 2.5
percent at the Feb. 21 policy setting meeting, according to all
17 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “With these two data points in mind, a 25 basis-point rate
hike on Monday (to 2.5%) looks likely indeed, and we think a
further 100 basis points this year could be needed,” Lubin
said. “Even this might not be enough.”  The yield on the benchmark 5 percent Mimshal Shiklit due
January 2020 rose 1 basis point to 5.01 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
