U.S. nuclear-power output was little
changed after  Progress Energy Inc . reduced output at the Harris
1 reactor in North Carolina and  Edison International  started San
Onofre 3 in California, the  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  said.  Production by U.S. reactors fell 149 megawatts from
yesterday to 94,230 megawatts, or 93 percent of capacity,
according to a  report  today from the NRC and data compiled by
Bloomberg. Six reactors are offline.  Edison Internationalâ€™s 1,080-megawatt San Onofre 3 reactor,
about 4 miles (6 kilometers) southeast of San Clemente, is
operating at 15 percent of capacity. It was shut Oct. 10 for
maintenance including refueling and replacement of two steam
generators, Gil Alexander, a company spokesman, said in a Dec.
10 e-mail.  American Electric Power Co. reduced output at its 1,009-
megawatt D.C. Cook 1 reactor in Michigan to 65 percent of
capacity. The unit, which was at 100 percent of capacity
yesterday, is about 26 miles (42 kilometers) northwest of  South
Bend , Indiana.  Progress Energy reduced output at the 900-megawatt Harris 1
reactor to 63 percent of capacity from full power. The plant is
about 20 miles (32 kilometers) southwest of Raleigh.    DTE Energy Co . increased output for its 1,122-megawatt
Fermi 2 reactor in Michigan to 96 percent of capacity, the NRC
said. The unit, which operated at 57 percent of capacity
yesterday, is about 25 miles (40 kilometers) south of Detroit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
