The following is the text of the
Philadelphia area manufacturing activity from the  Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia .  According to respondents to the February Business Outlook Survey,
growth in the region’s manufacturing sector picked up this month.
Most of the broad indicators showed an improvement over their
readings in January, and employment among reporting firms
increased. Increases in input prices continued to be widespread
this month, and slightly more firms reported increases in prices
for their own manufactured goods. The survey’s broad indicators
of future activity suggest that firms expect a continued
expansion in activity over the next six months.  Indicators All Point to Growth  The survey’s broadest measure of manufacturing conditions, the
diffusion index of current activity, increased from 19.3 in
January to 35.9 this month.  This is the highest reading since
January 2004 (see Chart).  The demand for manufactured goods is
showing continued strength: Although the new orders index was
virtually unchanged in February, it has increased over the past
six months. The shipments index also improved markedly,
increasing 22 points.  Firms also reported a rise in unfilled
orders and longer delivery times this month.  FirmsEresponses continue to indicate improving labor market
conditions. The current employment index increased 6 points, and
for the sixth consecutive month, the percentage of firms
reporting an increase in employment (29 percent) is higher than
the percentage reporting a decline (5 percent).  More than twice
as many firms reported a longer workweek (23 percent) than
reported a shorter one (10 percent).  Firms Report Higher Prices  Price increases for inputs as well as firmsEown manufactured
goods were more widespread again this month. Sixty-seven percent
of the firms reported higher prices for inputs, compared with 54
percent in the previous month.  The prices paid index, which
increased 13 points in February, has now increased 55 points
over the past five months. On balance, firms also reported a
rise in prices for their own manufactured goods. The prices
received index increased 4 points and has steadily increased
over the past four months. Twenty-nine percent of firms reported
higher prices for their own goods this month, compared to 26
percent in January.  Firms Expect Growth to Continue  The future general activity index remained positive for the 27th
consecutive month but fell back 3 points, from 49.8 in January
to 46.8 (see Chart). The indexes for future new orders and
shipments remained at relatively high levels. The future
shipments index increased 9 points, but the future new orders
index fell 1 point. The future employment index decreased 7
points but continues to reflect optimism about employment growth
overall. More firms expect to increase employment over the next
six months (32 percent) than expect to decrease employment (8
percent).  In this month’s special questions, firms were asked about
pricing of their products since the beginning of the year and
their expectations for price changes in the near future (see
Special Questions). Since the beginning of the year, 57 percent
of the res-ponding firms indicated some increase in prices for
their own goods, with the most frequently cited range of
increase between 3 and 4 percent.  Fifty-nine percent indicated
that they expect increases over the next three months, with the
most frequently cited range also between 3 and 4 percent. Nearly
29 percent of firms reported currently experiencing shortages or
delayed delivery of critical raw or intermediate products, with
the most commonly cited products being steel or steel-related
and other metals.  Summary  According to respondents to the February Business Outlook Survey,
the region’s manufacturing sector is gaining strength. All of
the broad indicators showed improvement, with new orders
continuing to expand.  Firms also reported a pickup in hiring
with a higher percentage of firms expanding payrolls. Increases
in input prices continue to be reported, and more firms have
been reporting higher prices for their own manufactured goods.
Firms remain confident that an expansion of manufacturing
activity will continue over the next six months.  SPECIAL QUESTIONS (February 2011)
