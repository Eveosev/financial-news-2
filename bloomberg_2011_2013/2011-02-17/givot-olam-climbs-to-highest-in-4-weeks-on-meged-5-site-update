  Givot Olam Oil Exploration LP 
increased to the highest level in almost four weeks after the
Israeli oil and gas explorer provided an update on its Meged 5
drilling site.  The shares climbed as much as 19 percent to 0.093 shekel,
the highest since Jan. 23, and were 14 percent higher at 0.089
shekel at 1:41 p.m. in Tel Aviv, giving the Jerusalem-based
company a market value of 930 million shekels ($258 million).  The daily flow at section eight of Meged 5 is 1,000 barrels
of oil together with 2 million cubic feet of associated
petroleum gas, Givot said today in a  statement  to the Tel Aviv
Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
