Danske Capital, a Copenhagen-based
fund which owns 1.7 percent of Danisco A/S shares, is counting
on DuPont Co. to extend its $5.8 billion takeover offer and will
decide whether to accept it at the last possible moment.  “We expect that DuPont will extend the offer period
because the company hasn’t achieved the needed Chinese approval
and the deadline is approaching,” Jesper Poll, a portfolio
manager at Danske Capital, said today in a telephone interview.  Poll said Danske Capital is “lukewarm” to the offer,
which is scheduled to expire on Feb. 22 and is contingent on the
acceptance of investors holding more than 90 percent of shares.
Elliott Associates LP, a hedge fund and Danisco shareholder, has
voiced its opposition to the takeover agreement, saying it
undervalues the company by at least $320 million.  “It’s not a very impressive bid, but it’s not completely
unacceptable either,” Poll said.  The offer of 665 kroner ($121) a share for Danisco is
“fair, full and firm,” Michael Hanretta, a DuPont spokesman,
said today in a telephone interview, repeating earlier comments
made by the Wilmington, Delaware-based company. He declined to
comment on whether the offer deadline will be extended.  To contact the reporter on this story:
