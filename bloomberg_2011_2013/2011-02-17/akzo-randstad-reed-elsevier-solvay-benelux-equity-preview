The Netherlands’  AEX-Index  advanced
1.5, or 0.4 percent, to 372.99 in Amsterdam, the highest since
September 2008. Belgium’s Bel20 Index added 0.6 percent to
2,770.81, a fifth day of gains.  The following were among the most active stocks in Benelux
markets today. Symbols are in parentheses.  Dutch stocks:    Akzo Nobel NV  (AKZA NA) added 3.3 percent to 50.14 euros,
the highest level since June 2008. The world’s biggest
paintmaker reported fourth-quarter profit that beat analysts’
estimates, driven by paint demand in  Asia  and sales of polymers
and personal-care ingredients.    Randstad Holding NV  (RAND NA) lost 5.2 percent to 39.80
euros, the biggest decline since June 2009. The world’s second-
largest staffing company reported fourth-quarter net income of
136.6 million euros and said the trends as witnessed in the
final three months of 2010 have so far continued into 2011.  Randstad’s results and outlook are “not enough to move the
needle,” Rabo Securities analysts said in a note to investors.    Reed Elsevier NV  (REN NA) fell 1.9 percent to 9.808 euros,
a fourth consecutive drop. The owner of the LexisNexis database
said full-year profit and revenue were little changed. Chief
Executive Officer Erik Engstrom said he expects a gradual
recovery and continued improvement in performance this year,
adding that the company is targeting some small acquisitions and
aims to get out of less profitable businesses.  Belgian stocks:    EVS Broadcast Equipment SA  (EVS BB) declined 4 percent to
44.01 euros, the biggest plunge since Nov. 23. The world’s
largest supplier of digital disk recorders for outside broadcast
trucks said net income for the fourth quarter fell to 8.2
million euros ($11.2 million) from 9.4 million euros.    Solvay SA  (SOLB BB) surged 4.8 percent to 84.17 euros, the
highest since Sept. 2008. The world’s largest soda-ash maker
said earnings before interest, tax and one-time items from
continuing operations rose 75 percent to 155 million euros. The
median estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News was
for operating profit of 124 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
