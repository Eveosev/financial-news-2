  Axa SA , Europe’s second-biggest
insurer, said 2010 profit dropped 24 percent after posting a
loss on the sale of most of its U.K. life business.  Net income fell to 2.75 billion euros ($3.73 billion) from
3.61 billion euros a year earlier, the Paris-based company said
today in a statement. That’s less than the 2.87 billion-euro
average estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “In 2011, Axa should benefit from an improving macro-
economic outlook,” Chief Executive Officer Henri de Castries
said in the statement.  Insurers’ profitability is under pressure as low  interest
rates  weigh on investment returns and demand for life insurance
weakens. To help revive profit, de Castries is cutting
businesses in developed markets such as the U.K. to tap more
clients in faster-growing Asian economies.  Axa fell 30 cents, or 1.9 percent, to 15.63 euros at 9:12
a.m. in Paris. The stock has gained 25 percent this year, giving
the company a market value of 36.2 billion euros. Munich-based
Allianz SE,  Europe ’s largest insurer, has risen 21 percent.  Earnings for the year were curbed by the 1.64 billion-euro
loss from the sale of most of Axa’s U.K. life-insurance business
to Resolution Ltd.  Fund Outflows  Excluding the loss, net income rose 18 percent. Property
and casualty operating earnings added 1 percent to 1.69 billion
euros, while the life and savings unit, the company’s biggest,
rose 5 percent to 2.46 billion euros.  Axa’s solvency ratio, a measure of an insurer’s capacity to
absorb losses, was 182 percent at the end of last year from 171
percent at the end of 2009, the insurer said.  Asset-management outflows for 2010 were 64 billion euros as
clients withdrew funds at the U.S. units, Axa said. Outflows at
Axa Rosenberg, which agreed to pay $242 million to resolve
claims in the first U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission case
on a quantitative-investment model glitch, have stabilized at
about $32 billion from about $70 billion at the start of 2010,
Chairman Dominique Carrel-Billiard said on Feb. 4.  De Castries said in November he expects to cut costs by at
least 1.5 billion euros by 2015 at the company’s  life-insurance 
and property-and-casualty businesses. The insurer will present
its “deployment plan” in the first half of 2011, he said.  The company also has said it expects 300 million euros to
500 million euros a year of net realized gains from investments
on assets such as equities.    Asia  Plans  De Castries is counting on growth in Asia. Axa, along with
AMP Ltd., made an offer of A$13.3 billion ($13.4 billion) for
Melbourne-based  Axa Asia Pacific Holdings Ltd . to take control
of businesses in a region where wealth is growing at the world’s
quickest rate.  Under the planned operation, Axa, which currently owns 54
percent of Axa Asia Pacific, will take full control of
operations in countries including Indonesia, Thailand and  India .  Axa’s bid with AMP is at least the fourth attempt by the
French insurer to buy out its Asian units since 2004. The
company withdrew a A$3.4 billion offer in October that year
after it was rejected, before returning with a new proposal in
2009 with AMP. After that was nixed, Axa joined National
Australia Bank for another offer that was also blocked last
year.  Axa Asia Pacific shareholders are due to vote March 2 on
whether to accept the offer. The bid was accepted by the wealth
manager’s board last year after a rival offer from National
Australia Bank Ltd. was blocked by the regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
