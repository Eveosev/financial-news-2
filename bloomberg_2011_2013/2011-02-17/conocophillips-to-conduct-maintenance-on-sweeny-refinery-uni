  ConocoPhillips  began shutting a
fluid catalytic cracker for maintenance at its Sweeny refinery
in Texas today, according to a filing with state regulators.  The work is expected to last until March 3, according to
the  filing  with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality.  ConocoPhillips typically does not comment on regulatory
filings, Rich Johnson, a company spokesman, said in an e-mail.  The unit is being shut to allow for an inspection and
possible repair of the standpipe inside the regenerator vessel,
according to the filing.  The refinery has a capacity of 260,000 barrels a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:  Aaron Clark  in New York at
