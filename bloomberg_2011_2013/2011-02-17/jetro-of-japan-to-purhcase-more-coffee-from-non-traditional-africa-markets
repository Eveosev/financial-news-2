Japan plans to buy more coffee
outside its traditional African markets in an effort to broaden
cooperation with producers on the continent, the state-run Japan
External Trade Organization said.  The world’s third-biggest economy wants to increase
purchases from Uganda, Rwanda, Malawi and Cameroon, Toyokazu
Fukuyama, an official at the organization known as Jetro, said
in an interview at a coffee conference yesterday in Arusha,
northern Tanzania.  Japan’s traditional sources of coffee on the continent are
Ethiopia, Kenya and Tanzania, Fukuyama said.  Brazil ,  Costa Rica 
and Jamaica are the country’s other main suppliers, he said.  “As part of cooperation with African countries we want to
venture into new markets for coffee,” he said. “We have started
and we want to build on the small level from these countries.”  Japan consumes 84,000 metric tons of coffee annually, with
per capita consumption at 1.7 kilograms (3.75 pounds), according
to the  International Coffee Organization ’s website. Africa
accounts for 12 percent of global output of the beans, according
to the InterAfrican Coffee Organization, which represents 25 of
the continent’s largest producers.  Jetro  started seminars for Japanese coffee buyers to
promote non-traditional markets as a source of beans, though
volumes of purchases have yet to be determined, Fukuyama said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
