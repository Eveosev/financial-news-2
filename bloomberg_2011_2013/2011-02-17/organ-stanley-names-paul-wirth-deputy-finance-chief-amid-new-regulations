  Morgan Stanley , the world’s top
merger adviser, promoted Finance Director Paul Wirth to be
deputy chief financial officer.  Wirth, 53, will report to CFO Ruth Porat in his new role,
according to an internal memo obtained today by Bloomberg News.
Mark Lake, a spokesman for the New York-based firm, confirmed
the contents of the memo.  Morgan Stanley, owner of the world’s largest brokerage, is
shifting how it allocates resources to its businesses as banks
face higher capital requirements, Chief Executive Officer  James Gorman  said this month. The firm will likely have a Tier 1
common equity ratio of 8 percent to 10 percent under so-called
Basel III by the end of 2012, Porat said in January.  “In light of the growing number of strategic initiatives
and regulatory mandates that lie ahead, Paul will provide valued
leadership,” Porat wrote in the memo.  Wirth previously worked at Credit Suisse Group AG and
Deloitte & Touche LLP.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Michael Moore  in New York at
