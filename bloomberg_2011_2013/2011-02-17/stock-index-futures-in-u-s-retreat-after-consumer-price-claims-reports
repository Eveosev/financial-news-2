U.S. stocks rose, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to a 32-month high, as improving
corporate earnings and manufacturing data overshadowed higher-
than-forecast growth in consumer prices.    Cliffs Natural Resources Inc . jumped 7.2 percent after
profit beat analysts’ estimates.  Nvidia Corp . added 9.8 percent
as the maker of graphics chips forecast higher sales than
analysts had predicted.  American Express Co . slumped 2.3 percent
amid investor concern about the impact of a proposed rule on
interchange fees. Huntington Bancshares Inc. declined 2.5
percent after Bank of America Corp. cut its stock rating.  The S&P 500 rose 0.3 percent to 1,340.43 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  climbed 29.97 points, or
0.2 percent, to 12,318.14. Both gauges are at the highest levels
since June 2008. Stocks fell earlier as anti-government protests
spread in the Middle East and  Iran ’s state-run Press TV said the
nation is sending warships to use  Egypt ’s Suez Canal.  “There’s economic momentum,” said Bruce McCain, who
oversees $25 billion as chief investment strategist at the
private-banking unit of KeyCorp in  Cleveland . “The consumer is
back, businesses have been more optimistic, manufacturing has
been expanding and earnings have been good. That’s enough to
keep the stock rally going.”  Highest Since 2008  The S&P 500 has climbed more than 98 percent from a 12-year
low in March 2009 as government stimulus measures, improving
profits and takeovers bolstered confidence in equities. Per-
share earnings have topped analysts’ estimates at about 72
percent of the 387 companies in the  S&P 500  that have reported
results since Jan. 10 and have grown 35 percent collectively,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stock futures fell before the open of exchanges as the
Labor Department said the consumer-price index rose 0.4 percent
for a second month, exceeding the 0.3 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. A separate report showed
that applications for jobless benefits increased by 25,000 to
410,000 in the week ended Feb. 12, exceeding the 400,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed.  Stocks began rebounding after the Federal Reserve Bank of
Philadelphia’s general economic index rose to 35.9, the highest
level since January 2004 and exceeding the median forecast of 21
in a Bloomberg News survey of economists. Separately, the
Conference Board’s index of U.S. leading indicators rose in
January for the seventh straight month, signaling the expansion
will extend into this year.  Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index    Consumer confidence  last week held near a two-month low,
and more Americans turned pessimistic on the outlook for the
economy as gasoline prices rose. The Bloomberg Consumer Comfort
Index, formerly the ABC News US Weekly Consumer Comfort Index,
was minus 43.4 in the period to Feb. 13 compared with minus 46
the prior week. Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said the
economy will worsen, the most since November and up from 23
percent in early January, today’s release said.  “Sentiment’s still cautious,” said  William Nichols ,
senior managing director in equity trading at Cantor Fitzgerald
LP in  New York . “Because we haven’t had inflation for a long
period of time, people are sort of wary that at some point
interest rates are going higher. It’s just a matter of when.”  Cliffs, Nvidia  Cliffs Natural Resources rose 7.2 percent to $99.52.  North
America ’s largest iron-ore producer reported fourth-quarter
earnings of $2.25 a share excluding some items. Analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg were expecting profit of $2.22 a share.
The company also boosted its 2011 North American iron-ore sales
forecast to about 28 million tons.  Nvidia rose 9.8 percent to $25.68. The maker of graphics
chips forecast fiscal first-quarter sales will rise to at least
$939.6 million. That compares with the $889.6 million projected
by analysts on average, a sign that consumer demand for personal
computers is improving.  Joy Global Inc. gained 1.2 percent to $98.07. The
Milwaukee-based maker of mining equipment will replace Allegheny
Energy Inc. in the  S&P 500 index , S&P said on its website.  American Express fell the most in the Dow average, dropping
2.3 percent to $45.78. Federal Reserve Governor  Sarah Bloom Raskin  said the central bank won’t commit itself on a final rule
for capping debit-card “swipe” fees until it has a chance to
review public comments on the proposal released in December. The
provision and the resulting regulations “may result in
significant market changes,” she said in her prepared remarks.  Huntington, Lexmark  Huntington Bancshares declined 2.5 percent to $7.35. The
Ohio bank’s stock rating was cut to “neutral” from “buy” at
Bank of America.    Lexmark International Inc . slumped 1.4 percent to $38.95.
The maker of laser and inkjet printers is facing increasing
competition from  Hewlett-Packard Co . and others, Morgan Stanley
analyst Kathryn Huberty wrote in a note.    NetApp Inc . plunged 6.4 percent, the most in the S&P 500,
to $54.77. The maker of data-storage products forecast fourth-
quarter profit that trailed analyst estimates. Excluding some
costs, earnings in the current quarter will be 49 cents to 53
cents a share, below the 54-cents average of analyst
projections.  U.S. stocks haven’t surged this much amid price swings this
narrow since 1971, an indication the S&P 500 may stall after
almost doubling from its March 2009 lows.  Realized Volatility  The benchmark measure of U.S. shares has rallied 31 percent
from July 2 through yesterday and an options-market indicator
known as 30-day realized volatility fell below 10 on Feb. 15, a
combination last seen 40 years ago, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. When volatility dropped to these levels since 1962
and stayed there three days, the index lost 0.1 percent on
average in the ensuing week, and lagged behind its long-term
return in the next month before outperforming during the entire
year, Bloomberg Businessweek reports in its Feb. 21 edition.  “It is unusual to have such a slow grind higher with lower
volatility,” said  Walter Todd , who helps manage about $900
million at Greenwood Capital Associates in Greenwood,  South
Carolina . “Clearly there have been some fundamental drivers,
with an improving economy and earnings. Having said all that, I
do think complacency is an issue. I would not try to be short
this market, but do think it makes some sense to take a little
money off the table.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
