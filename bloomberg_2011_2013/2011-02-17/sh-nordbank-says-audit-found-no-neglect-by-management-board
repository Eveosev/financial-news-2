HSH Nordbank AG, which had to be
bailed out during the financial crisis, said an examination by  Germany ’s financial regulator found “no breaches of duty” at
management level regarding practices to award contracts.  Findings of the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority’s
special audit were presented to Nordbank’s supervisory board by
external legal coordinator Klaus Landry today, Hamburg-based
Nordbank said in an e-mailed statement.  “The report states that there were inconsistencies in the
bank’s contract award process -- no breaches of duty by the
management board were detected at any time,” Nordbank said,
adding there is “no need for action by the supervisory board.”  The German states of Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein, which
together control 85.5 percent of Nordbank, provided the lender
with 3 billion euros ($4.1 billion) in capital and 10 billion
euros in guarantees to cover potential losses during the crisis.
The bank also tapped Germany’s Soffin bank-rescue fund for 17
billion euros in guarantees. Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein last
year asked Nordbank to fire Chief Executive Officer Dirk Jens Nonnenmacher, following allegations of spying at the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
