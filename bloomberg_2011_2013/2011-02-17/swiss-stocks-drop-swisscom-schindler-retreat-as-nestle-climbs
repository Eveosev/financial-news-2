Swiss stocks retreated for the first
time in five days as  Swisscom AG  posted earnings that missed
analysts’ estimates and  Schindler Holding AG  forecast that it
will make less profit this year than it did in 2010.  Swisscom dropped the most since April, plunging 3.9
percent. Schindler, the world’s second-largest maker of
elevators, fell 6.1 percent.  Nestle SA , the world’s biggest food
company, gained after saying it’s “confident” that revenue
will rise in 2011.  The  Swiss Market Index , a benchmark gauge of 20 large
companies, lost 0.1 percent to 6,706.47 at the 5:30 p.m. close
in Zurich, declining from yesterday’s 10-month high. The gauge
has still risen 4.2 percent this year as investors speculated
that the global economic recovery is on track. The broader Swiss
Performance Index also fell 0.1 percent today.  U.S. reports showed today that the cost of living climbed
more than forecast in January and more Americans than projected
filed first-time claims for jobless benefits last week.  “The inflation and jobless numbers may act as a bit of a
balance to the marketst,” said Ed Woolfitt, head of trading at
Galvan Research and Trading in Truro,  England .  Federal Reserve  policy makers took a more optimistic view
of the  U.S. economy  in January while maintaining their
dissatisfaction with job growth as they continued to expand the
record monetary stimulus, the minutes of last month’s policy
meeting released late yesterday showed.  Recouped Losses  Swiss stocks recouped some losses as the index of U.S.
leading indicators rose in January for the seventh straight
month, while the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general
economic index rose to 35.9 in February from 19.3 last month.  Swisscom dropped 3.9 percent to 416.5 Swiss francs after  Switzerland ’s largest phone company said fourth-quarter profit
declined to 388 million francs ($405 million) from 400 million
francs a year earlier.  Schindler plunged 6.1 percent to 104.4 francs after
predicting that its net income will fall in 2011 because of
restructuring costs and the continued strength of the franc.    ABB Ltd . slid 3.3 percent to 22.41 francs after the world’s
largest maker of transmission gear reported fourth-quarter
earnings before interest and taxes of $978 million, trailing the
average estimate of $1.09 billion by 22 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Nestle Gains  Nestle advanced 0.9 percent to 52.9 francs after reporting
2010 sales growth that beat analysts’ estimates. So-called
organic sales rose 6.2 percent, compared with the 5.4 percent
average estimate of eight analysts, as Nestle sold more
Nespresso capsules.  The maker of Aero and KitKat chocolate bars also said it’s
“confident” revenue will increase 5 percent to 6 percent in
2011, excluding acquisitions, disposals and currency shifts.  Swiss Reinsurance Co. climbed 3.9 percent to 58.2 francs,
the highest price in more than two years, as the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer almost tripled its dividend after repaying
capital injected by  Warren Buffett .  Repayment costs of $1.4 billion led to a fourth-quarter net
loss of $725 million after a profit of $394 million a year
earlier, the Zurich-based reinsurer said.    Nobel Biocare Holding AG  rallied 4.8 percent to 19.97
francs as the maker of dental implants forecast that it will
return to “at least market growth” in next six months after
reporting an 80 percent drop in fourth-quarter net income.    Dufry Group  surged 6.7 percent to 110.4 francs, the biggest
gain since February last year, as Kepler Capital Markets said
the shares are at “an attractive entry point.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
