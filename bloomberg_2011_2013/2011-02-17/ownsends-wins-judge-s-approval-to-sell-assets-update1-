Townsends Inc., a family-owned
chicken and egg producer based in Georgetown,  Delaware , won
court approval to sell virtually all of its assets to Peco Foods
Inc. and Omtron Ltd. for about $76.4 million.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Christopher S. Sontchi said today he
will approve the deals after sale documents are revised. Peco,
based in Tuscaloosa,  Alabama , will buy Townsends’ Arkansas
operations for about $51.4 million and Omitron will acquire the
remaining assets for about $24.9 million, Derek C. Abbott, a
lawyer for Townsends, told Sontchi.  Townsends’ auction was “substantially more successful than
we envisioned,” Abbott said at a hearing in Wilmington,
Delaware. The sales should be completed by Feb. 25, he told
Sontchi.  Townsends filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Dec. 19,
listing about $131 million in assets and about $127 million in
debt as of Dec. 5. The company, founded in 1891, produces 700
million pounds of poultry a year and 1.3 million eggs a week
through more than 300 contractors, according to court papers.
Revenue was $504.2 million for the year ended Dec. 5.  Townsends, which has three factories in  North Carolina  and
one in Arkansas, also makes almost 1 million tons of feed
annually, court documents show.  The case is In re Townsends Inc., 10-14092,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
