Pepsi Cola is on sale again at U.K.
supermarket chain  J Sainsbury Plc  after a disagreement over
pricing, the Financial Times reported, without saying where it
got the information.  Sainsbury agreed, at least in part, to higher prices
demanded by  Britvic Plc , which bottles Pepsi in the U.K.;
Britvic stopped deliveries to Sainsbury, which led to shortages
in the supermarkets in the past two weeks, the newspaper said.  Sainsbury and Britvic declined to comment, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
