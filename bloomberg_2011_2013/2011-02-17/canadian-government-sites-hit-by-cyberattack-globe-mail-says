Canadian government departments are
trying to deal with an outside cyberattack, and an investigation
is concentrating on Chinese addresses, the Globe & Mail
reported.  The attack became evident at the Treasury Department this
month and has since affected several other departments,
including finance, where officials are working on next month’s
budget, the newspaper said.  This isn’t the first such attack, officials told the Globe &
Mail.  Jay Denney, a spokesman for  Stockwell Day , the president of
the Treasury Board, confirmed to the newspaper that an
“unauthorized attempt” to gain access to the board’s computer
networks was detected, adding that there’s no indication that
data relating to Canadians was compromised.  A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, responding to reports
that Chinese hackers are involved, commented that  China  attaches
importance to computer security and is also affected by the
international hacking problem.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
