A militia group fighting for the
independence of  Senegal ’s Casamance province said it wants the  African Union  to organize a referendum on secession and that it
would accept the results, Le Pop reported.  The recent pickup in violence in the region will continue
because Senegal’s government doesn’t have the means to end the
conflict or the political will to negotiate, the secretary
general of the militia, Ansoumana Badji, told the Dakar-based
newspaper.  Rebels in the Casamance have been attacking Senegalese
military targets since 1982.  To contact the reporter on this story:
