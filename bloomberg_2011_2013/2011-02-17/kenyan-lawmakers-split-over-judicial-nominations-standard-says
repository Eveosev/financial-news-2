A Kenyan parliamentary committee
scrutinizing three judicial nominations by President  Mwai Kibaki 
is split along party lines, the Standard said, citing a report
by the panel.  Members of Kibaki’s Party of National Unity and other
supporters of the president recommended that the nominees for
the offices of attorney general and director of public
prosecutions be vetted immediately, while that of chief justice
should be renegotiated, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  Lawmakers from Prime Minister  Raila Odinga ’s Orange
Democratic Movement rejected all three nominations, the
newspaper said.  Odinga last month objected to Kibaki’s nomination of a new
chief justice, director of public prosecution, attorney general
and budget controller, citing a lack of consultation as required
by law. The two men agreed to share power after violence in East
Africa’s largest economy following a disputed election in
December 2007 left 1,500 people dead.  To contact the reporter on this story:
