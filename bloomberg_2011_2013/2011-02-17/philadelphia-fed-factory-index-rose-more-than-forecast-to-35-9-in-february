(Corrects executive’s title in penultimate paragraph in
story published Feb. 17.)  Manufacturing in the Philadelphia
region expanded in February at the fastest pace in seven years,
underscoring factories’ contribution to the economic expansion.  The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic
index rose to 35.9, the highest level since January 2004 and
exceeding the median forecast of 21 in a Bloomberg News survey
of economists. Readings greater than zero signal expansion in
the area covering eastern  Pennsylvania , southern  New Jersey  and  Delaware .  Demand for new equipment and more exports is supporting
manufacturers like  Dell Inc . and  Parker Hannifin Corp . Increased  consumer spending , the largest part of the economy, could lead
to faster job growth as factories continue to expand.  “We’re still looking for activity to be strong definitely
throughout the first half of the year,” said  David Semmens , an
economist at Standard Chartered Bank. “There is an increase in
demand for labor, both in the number of employees and the
average working week, which means people are going to have more
money in their pockets.”  Estimates for the manufacturing gauge in the Bloomberg
survey of 56 economists ranged from 15 to 25.  The similar report from the New York Fed this week showed
manufacturing in that region sped up in February. The bank’s
general economic index rose to 15.4 from 11.9 in January.  Claims, Prices  Other reports today showed more Americans filed
applications for unemployment insurance payments last week,
rising food and fuel costs drove up the cost of living last
month and consumer comfort held last week near a two-month low.  The number of claims for jobless benefits increased to
410,000 from 385,000 the prior week, figures from the Labor
Department showed. Consumer prices rose 0.4 percent in January,
according to other Labor Department data. Excluding food and
fuel, the so-called core gauge rose 0.2 percent from the prior
month, the most since October 2009.  Also today, the Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index, formerly
the ABC News US Weekly Consumer Comfort Index, climbed to minus
43.4 in the period to Feb. 13 compared with minus 46 the prior
week. Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said the economy
will worsen, the most since November and up from 23 percent in
early January.  Stocks fell after the reports. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index decreased 0.1 percent to 1,334.84 at 10:34 a.m. in New
York.  Treasury securities  rose, pushing the yield on the
benchmark 10-year note down to 3.55 percent from 3.62 percent
late yesterday.  Production Increases  Production at U.S. factories climbed in January for a fifth
consecutive month, Fed figures showed yesterday. Manufacturing
output increased 0.3 percent after a revised 0.9 percent jump in
December that was more than twice as large as previously
reported.  The employment index in the Philadelphia Fed report climbed
to 23.6, the highest level since April 1973, from a reading last
month of 17.6. A measure of the average workweek rose to 12.8 in
February from 10.6.  The Philadelphia Fed’s new orders measure rose to 23.7, the
highest level since Sept. 2004, from 23.6 in January. The
shipments gauge jumped to 35.2 from 13.4 last month.  The index of prices paid increased to 67.2 from 54.3 the
prior month, while the measure of prices received advanced to 21
from 17.1.  Sentiment Gauge  Individual measures in the index don’t contribute to the
headline reading, so some economists consider it a gauge of
sentiment among manufacturers.  Economists monitor Philadelphia and  New York  Fed factory
reports for clues about the Institute for Supply Management
national figures on manufacturing during the month. The ISM will
release its report on March 1.  Overseas demand for American goods is helping support U.S.
manufacturing, which makes up about 11 percent of the economy.
Exports rose 1.8 percent in December to the highest level since
July 2008, according to Commerce Department data released Feb.
11. For all of last year, exports increased 17 percent, the
biggest one-year gain since 1988.  “We continue to see strong demand globally across many of
our businesses,” Nicholas Fanandakis, chief financial officer
at DuPont Co., the third-biggest U.S. chemical maker, said Jan.
25 during a conference call with analysts.  DuPont posted fourth-quarter earnings that beat analysts’
estimates as paint-pigment and solar-materials jumped and taxes
plunged. The Wilmington, Delaware-based company raised its 2011
profit forecast for this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
