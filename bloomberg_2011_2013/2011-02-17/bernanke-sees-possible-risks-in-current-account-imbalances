Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said that current-account imbalances could pose risks
to the financial system.  Such irregularities “could in principal be a systemic
risk, and I think they contributed to the crisis” in financial
markets last decade, Bernanke said today at a hearing of the
Senate Banking Committee in Washington.  Bernanke said he “wouldn’t make too much” of recent
changes in China’s holdings of Treasury securities as they are
the result of  China ’s effort to maintain its currency peg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
