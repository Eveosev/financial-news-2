Japanese lawmakers including Kenji Tamura, former parliamentary secretary at Japan’s Financial
Services Agency, began a review into a  consumer-lending  law that
caps interest rates and led to Takefuji Corp.’s bankruptcy.  About 30 legislators held the first round of meetings in
Tokyo today to determine if small and medium-sized companies
have adequate access to credit after the law was tightened last
year, according to Liberal Democratic Party member  Masaaki Taira .  A four-year government crackdown on consumer lending,
including a law restricting loan amounts, forced Takefuji into
bankruptcy in September. It also spurred an increase in claims
of overcharged interest against lenders including Acom Co.,
Promise Co. and  Aiful Corp ., curtailing their earnings and
restricting credit growth for the year ending March 31.  “Several small businesses ended up approaching black-
market lenders after the revised law made it harder for them to
secure decent financing,”  Kenzo Fujisue , a member of the ruling  Democratic Party  of Japan, said at the meeting.  The revised law caps interest rates at 20 percent and
restricts loans to a third of a borrower’s income. The group
will hold a second round of meetings next month, and will
compile a report in a few months, Taira said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
