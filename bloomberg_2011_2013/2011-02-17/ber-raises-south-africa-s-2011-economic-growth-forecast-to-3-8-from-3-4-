  South Africa â€™s Bureau for Economic
Research raised its forecast for economic growth this year to
3.8 percent from 3.4 percent.  Growth will probably reach 3.9 percent in 2012, the bureau,
based at the University of Stellenbosch, near  Cape Town , said in
an e-mailed statement today. Inflation, which is expected to
average 4.7 percent this year, may breach the upper end of the 3
percent to 6 percent target range in the second half of the year
if food prices continue to increase, the bureau said.  The rand is forecast to reach 7.30 per dollar by the end of
2011 and average 7.78 in the fourth quarter of 2012, the bureau
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
