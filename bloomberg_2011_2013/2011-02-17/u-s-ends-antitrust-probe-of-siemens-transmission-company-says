The U.S. Department of Justice ended
an antitrust probe into  Siemens AG , Europe’s biggest engineering
company, concerning flexible alternating-current transmission
systems, according to a company spokesman.  The DOJ reviewed allegation similar to ones that were
investigated by the European Union, Alexander Becker, a
spokesman for the Munich-based company, said in an interview
today. Becker didn’t specify the reason why the U.S. case was
closed. The EU’s regulators dropped their investigation in
September.  Siemens and  ABB Ltd ., the world’s biggest power-grid
supplier, were being investigated by the European Commission,
the EU’s executive, over the issue last year. The commission and
national officials conducted raids in January 2010 over
allegations some companies may have fixed prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
