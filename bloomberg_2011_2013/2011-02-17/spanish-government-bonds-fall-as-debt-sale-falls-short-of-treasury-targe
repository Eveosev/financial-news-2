Spanish bonds declined after the
nation sold fewer bonds than targeted.  The yield on the 10-year bond rose five basis points to
5.38 percent as of 10:01 a.m. in  London .    Spain  sold 1 billion euros of bonds maturing in 2037 and
2.5 billion euros of bonds due 2020. The debt office had set a
target of 4 billion euros.  Demand for the 10-year debt fell to 1.54 from a bid-to-
cover ratio of 1.67 at a previous auction in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
