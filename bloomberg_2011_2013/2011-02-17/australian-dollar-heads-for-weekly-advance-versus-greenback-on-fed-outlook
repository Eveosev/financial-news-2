The Australian dollar rose,
extending a weekly gain against its U.S. counterpart as
commodities advanced for a third straight day.  The Aussie fell earlier versus the greenback as  China ,
Australia’s biggest trading partner, ordered lenders to set
aside more money as reserves to restrain inflation and limit
asset bubbles. New Zealand’s currency had its first weekly gain
in February.  “It’s really supported by commodities,” said  Joe Manimbo ,
a market analyst in Washington at Travelex Global Business
Payments, a currency-exchange network. “The steps China took to
again increase reserve requirements -- that has slowed the
Aussie dollar’s earlier advance.”  Australia’s currency appreciated 0.3 percent to $1.0150 at
12:36 p.m. in New York, from $1.0119 yesterday, and advanced 1.3
percent this week. The currency was at 84.35 yen, compared with
84.30 yen. New Zealand’s dollar bought 76.32 U.S. cents,
compared with 75.89 cents, and traded at 63.46 yen, compared
with 63.22 yen.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 goods and raw
materials gained 0.4 percent, led by advances in silver and
coffee.  Benchmark  interest rates  are 4.75 percent in Australia and
3 percent in  New Zealand , compared with as low as zero in the
U.S. and Japan, attracting investors to the South Pacific
nations’ higher-yielding assets. The risk in such trades is that
currency market moves will erase profits.  RBNZ Rate Outlook  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand will increase interest
rates by 48 basis points during the next 12 months, according to
a Credit Suisse AG index based on overnight swaps. That matches
the lowest forecast since Jan. 11.  New Zealand’s budget deficit was larger than the
government’s forecast after earlier-than-expected payments made
to health boards, the Treasury Department said today. The
shortfall was NZ$13.2 billion ($10.1 billion) in the six months
ended Dec. 31, or NZ$555 million more than forecast in
December’s fiscal update, according to the  Treasury .  To contact the reporters on this story:
