The Congolese Wildlife Authority,
known as ICCN, filed charges with Congo’s attorney general
against London-based  Soco International Plc  after its employees
allegedly forced their way into Virunga National Park, the
park’s director said.  Soco employees entered the park near the Democratic
Republic of Congo’s border with  Uganda  accompanied by 12
Congolese soldiers on Feb. 14, Emmanuel de Merode, Virunga
National Park director, said in a phone interview today. The
company, which has rights to an oil exploration block that
overlaps Virunga, was told in a letter from ICCN in December
that it could not conduct oil exploration activities in the
park.  “The forcible entry is blatantly false,” Soco’s Deputy
Chief Executive Officer Roger Cagle said by phone yesterday from
London when informed by Bloomberg News that ICCN was considering
filing charges. Cagle said Soco was with a provincial member of
parliament and had permission to enter the park.  Cagle was not in his office when called for comment by
Bloomberg today. He did not immediately respond to an e-mail
requesting comment.  Soco was in the park conducting an environmental assessment
in an effort to receive permission to begin exploration, Cagle
said yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
