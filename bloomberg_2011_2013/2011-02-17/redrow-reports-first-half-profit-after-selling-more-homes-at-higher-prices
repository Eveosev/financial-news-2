  Redrow Plc , the smallest publicly
traded U.K. homebuilder by market value, reported a first-half
profit after selling more homes for higher prices.  Net income for the six months through December was 3.5
million pounds ($5.6 million), or 1.1 pence a share, compared
with a loss of 6.3 million pounds, or 2.6 pence, a year earlier,
the St. David’s Park, Wales-based company said today in a
statement. Revenue rose 15 percent to 216.1 million pounds.  U.K. house prices have fluctuated over the last several
months as a shortage of supply supports values while weakening  consumer confidence , government budget cuts and reduced mortgage
lending hurts demand. Former Bank of England policy maker  Kate Barker  said U.K. house prices may extend their drop this year on
lending restrictions and uncertainty with consumers.  “While it is still too early to call the spring market,
the second half has started encouragingly with reservations
during the first six weeks, comfortably ahead of the same period
last year,” Chairman Steve Morgan said in the statement.  Redrow shares have risen 21 percent in the last six months,
giving the company a market value of 406 million pounds. That’s
the second-worst performance among the eight companies in the
Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index.  The operating profit margin was 5.6 percent in the period.
Redrow sold 1,312 homes in the period, compared with 1,266 a
year earlier. Average selling prices for private homes increased
16 percent to 170,500 pounds.  -- Editors: Ross Larsen  To contact the reporter on this story:
