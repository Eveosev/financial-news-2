Corinthians spoke with Real  Madrid ’s
Kaka in “general terms” without making a specific offer to
sign the midfielder, an official at the Brazilian soccer team
said.  Corinthians are seeking a star player to replace striker
Ronaldo, who retired Feb. 14, Luis Paulo Rosenberg, the
marketing vice-president for the Sao Paulo-based team, said
today in an e-mail.  Kaka, whose full name is Ricardo Izecson dos Santos Leite,
was the FIFA World Player of the Year in 2007.  In 2009, record nine-time European champion Real Madrid
agreed to pay AC Milan as much as 68 million euros ($92 million)
for the Brazil playmaker, according to media reports. He
previously played for  Sao Paulo  in Brazil before moving to  Italy 
in 2003.  Kaka has been struggling with a knee injury at Real Madrid
this season and media reports have linked him with a move to
clubs including English champion Chelsea.  Real Madrid didn’t respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
