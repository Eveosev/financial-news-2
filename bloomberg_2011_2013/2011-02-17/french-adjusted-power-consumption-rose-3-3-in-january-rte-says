French power demand in January rose
3.3 percent from a year earlier to 53 terawatt-hours, adjusted
for winter and summer contingencies, according to  Reseau de
Transport d’Electricite , a unit of Electricite de  France  SA.  Gross consumption fell 4.6 percent to 53.7 terawatt-hours,
RTE said today in a statement on its website. The average
temperature was 4.8 degrees Celsius (40.6 Fahrenheit), 0.3
degrees below the norm and 2.8 degrees above the January 2010
average, the Paris-based company said. France is Europe’s
second-biggest power market after  Germany .  To contact the reporter on this story:
