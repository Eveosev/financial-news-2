The following is a reformatted
version of the U.S. Treasury Department’s daily release on the
schedule for Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other officials:  At 10 a.m. on Thursday, Secretary Geithner will testify
before the Senate Budget Committee on the Administration’s FY
2012 Budget, which lays out a responsible plan that puts the
nation on a path to live within our means so we can invest in
our future - by cutting wasteful spending and making tough
choices on programs we cannot afford, while making the
investments we need to grow the economy and create jobs.  The President’s Budget cuts the deficit he inherited in
half as a share of the economy by the end of his first term;
includes proposals that will reduce deficits by more than $1
trillion over the next 10 years; and cuts non-security
discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the
economy since Dwight Eisenhower was President. This hearing,
which will be held in the Dirksen Senate Office Building, is
open press.  On Thursday evening, the Secretary will depart  Washington 
for Paris,  France  to attend the G20 meeting of Finance Ministers
and Central Bank Governors February 18-19, 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
