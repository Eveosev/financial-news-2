  Tullett Prebon Plc , the London-based
inter-dealer broker, hired a team of three brokers from CIMD SA
in Madrid to expand its services in  Spain ’s over-the-counter
electricity market.  Pablo Cabello, Carmen Nunez and Patricia Lopez joined
Tullett last month, Kevin McDermott, a Tullett Prebon director
for European energy and commodities, said today by e-mail. The
new hires are based in  London , and the company will open a
Madrid office in May or June, McDermott said.  “We wanted to add Spain to complete the puzzle of total
coverage of European power,” he said. “These brokers are
regarded as the best in the product by our customers.”  Power-trading volumes in Spain rose 5 percent in 2009 to
399 terawatt-hours, according to a report published last year by
London-based consultant  Prospex Research Ltd . Electricity
consumption on the Spanish peninsula, excluding the islands,
rose 2.9 percent to 259.9 terawatt-hours last year according to
grid operator Red Electrica Corp. SA.  That gives Spain a so-called churn rate, trading volume
divided by physical consumption, of about 1.5. In Germany,
Europe’s biggest consumer and the most liquid market, the churn
rate was 8.4 in 2009, according to Prospex.  Tullett, which competes in Europe’s over-the-counter energy
markets with brokers including  ICAP Plc ,  GFI Group Inc . and
Tradition Financial Services, also offers electricity contracts
in markets including Germany, France, the U.K., the Netherlands,
Belgium, Italy and eastern Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
