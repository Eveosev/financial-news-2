Zimbabwean Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said he won’t support elections unless there is a new
constitution, a biometric voters’ roll, a peaceful environment
and a credible electoral body.  Tsvangirai said today that his Movement for Democratic
Change party also wants the state-controlled media to halt its
bias toward President Robert Mugabe and his  Zimbabwe  African
National Union-Patriotic Front.  Mugabe and Tsvangirai formed a coalition government two
years ago after disputed elections the year before that were
characterized by widespread violence. Under the power-sharing
accord, Zimbabwe is supposed to hold a referendum on a new
constitution before staging elections. Mugabe intends to abandon
talks over a constitution and call a vote in June, three members
of his party’s decision-making body said last month.  “We have seen in the last few months the deployment of
soldiers and armed vigilantes into the countryside to recreate
the terror of 2008,” Tsvangirai said in an e-mailed statement.  Zanu-PF  did not answer calls to its headquarters when
Bloomberg sought comment today.  Mugabe said last month that elections may be held in
Zimbabwe, whether or not a new constitution has been approved.  Tsvangirai said that as prime minister, his support is
needed to call elections.  “I want to tell you today that executive authority in this
country is shared and the president has no power to announce an
election date without consulting the prime minister,”
Tsvangirai said in his statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
