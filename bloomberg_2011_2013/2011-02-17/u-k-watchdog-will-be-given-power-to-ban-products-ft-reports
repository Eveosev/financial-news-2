The U.K.’s new financial regulator,
one of three entities that will be formed after the break-up of
the Financial Services Authority next year, will have the power
to ban retail products or limit their distribution for up to 12
months as well as warn investors in advance about banks, brokers
and individuals accused of breaches, the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview with Treasury Minister Mark Hoban.  The powers to be granted to the Financial Conduct
Authority, which will be responsible for consumer protection and
policing the integrity of markets, represent “radical reform,”
Hoban said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
