David Allvey,  Costain Group Plc ’s
chairman, indicated that  Mouchel Group Plc , which Costain wants
to acquire, is showing more willingness to engage in
“conversations” after pressure from Schroders Plc, its biggest
investor, the Financial Times reported.  However, while Schroders fund manager Andy Brough urged
Mouchel, a support services company, to set a Feb. 18 deadline
for firm offers, no such date has been fixed, according to
Allvey, the newspaper said.  Mouchel, which has rejected two approaches from Costain and
has advised shareholders to take no action after a sweetened
offer of 151 pence a share, declined to comment, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
