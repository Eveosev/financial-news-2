The  Croatian government  plans to
open the tender tomorrow for a 221 million-euro ($300 million)
project to build a new airport, Transport Minister Bozidar Kalmeta said in the capital city Zagreb.  The government will decide on a contractor by September and
construction of the airport would begin in 2012, Kalmeta told
the cabinet. The first phase of work, during which a new
terminal and runways will be built, is estimated at 192 million
euros. After the airport exceeds 5 million travellers, another
29 million euros will be invested.  Aeroports de Paris and  Houston Airport System  have
expressed interest in bidding for the Zagreb airport contract,
as well as the companies that manage the airports of Frankfurt,
Munich, Istanbul, Zurich, Vienna and  Singapore , Lidija Capkovic,
a spokeswoman for the Zagreb airport, said on Feb. 8.  The airport will remain a property of the state, the cities
of Zagreb and the neighboring Velika Gorica, and the local
government, Kalmeta said. As much as 10 percent of the airport
may become property of its employees, he said.  The project is part of a 100 billion-kuna investment
program announced in September that the government said will
help create jobs and revive growth thatâ€™s been lagging behind
other countries in the region. The economy shrank about 1.5
percent in 2010, compared with 1.5 percent growth in neighboring  Serbia . Foreign direct investment dropped 30 percent in the
first nine months of 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
