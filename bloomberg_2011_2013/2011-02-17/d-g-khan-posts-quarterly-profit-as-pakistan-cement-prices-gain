D.G. Khan Cement Co.,  Pakistan ’s
second-biggest producer of the building material, posted a
second-quarter profit after cement prices increased on demand
for flood reconstruction.  Net income was 163.8 million rupees ($1.9 million) in the
three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of 115 million
rupees a year earlier, the cement maker said today in a
statement to the  Karachi Stock Exchange . Sales rose 37 percent
to 4.8 billion rupees.  Pakistan’s cement sales are rising as the nation rebuilds
after the worst floods in its 63-year history swept away 4,000
kilometers (2,485 miles) of roads and 1,000 bridges last year.
Demand for cement may gain 16 percent in the year ending in
June, analysts including Farhan Bashir Khan at Invest Capital &
Securities Ltd. in Karachi have said.  D.G. Khan shares fell by the daily limit of 5 percent to
25.67 rupees at the 3:30 p.m. close of trading on the Karachi
Stock Exchange. The stock has lost 15 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
