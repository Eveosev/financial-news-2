U.S. stocks are set up for a fall
now that the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has almost doubled in
less than two years, according to  Pierre Lapointe , a global
strategist at Brockhouse & Cooper Inc.  The CHART OF THE DAY displays an indicator that Lapointe
used in reaching this conclusion: a so-called relative strength
index for the S&P 500, based on the benchmark’s weekly closing
values. The RSI calculations use 14 weeks of data.  Yesterday’s reading of 75.48 was the highest since March
2004, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. When a relative
strength index rises above 70, it’s a sign that investors have
rushed to buy the underlying asset -- stocks, in this case --and
a decline is coming soon.  “Sentiment is almost euphoric, with very few skeptics
remaining,” Lapointe and Alex Bellefleur, an economist, wrote
today in a report. The degree of optimism among investors “is
leading us to be slightly more cautious.”  Brockhouse recommended that clients reduce their holdings
of stocks by five percentage points, to 60 percent, and increase
their bond investments by the same amount. The firm maintained a
5 percent allocation to cash.  The  S&P 500  climbed yesterday to more than double its March
2009 intraday low, and peaked at 1,337.61. The index must close
at 1,353.06 or higher to reach the same milestone relative to
its closing low from that month, when the most recent  bear
market  ended.  (To save a copy of the chart, click here.)  To contact the reporter on this story:
