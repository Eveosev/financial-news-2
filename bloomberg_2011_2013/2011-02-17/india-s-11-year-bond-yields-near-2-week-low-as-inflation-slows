The yield on  India ’s 11-year bond,
the most-traded government debt, dropped to the lowest level in
more than a month on speculation cooling inflation will boost
demand for fixed-income securities.  India’s food inflation slowed to a two-month low as more
fruits and vegetables arrived from the winter harvest. An index
measuring wholesale prices of agricultural products including
lentils, rice and vegetables rose 11.05 percent in the week
ended Feb. 5 from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said in
a statement today. The index gained 13.07 percent the previous
week.  “There is some buying interest as inflation is slowing,”
said Debendra Kumar Dash, a debt trader at Development Credit
Bank in Mumbai. “The budget is the next big event as investors
are waiting to gauge the government’s borrowing requirement.”  The yield on the 8.08 percent note due August 2022 fell two
basis points to 8.16 percent, the lowest level since Jan. 13, at
the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s
trading system. The market was closed yesterday for a holiday.  The cost of one-year interest-rate swaps, or derivative
contracts used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs,
fell three basis points to 7.47 percent. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The federal government is due to announce the annual budget
on Feb. 28.  The wholesale-price index rose 8.23 percent in January from
a year earlier after an 8.43 percent jump in December, the
commerce ministry said this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
