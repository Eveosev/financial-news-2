  Arcelik AS ,  Turkey ’s biggest maker
of fridges and washing machines, said profit last year rose 6.5
percent to 517.1 million liras ($327 million), missing
expectations, as higher input prices pushed up costs.  Net income climbed from 485.4 million liras in 2009,
Arcelik said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange 
today. The company was expected to earn 538.4 million liras,
according to the average estimate of 19 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey. Profit in the fourth quarter rose an annual 31 percent
to 98.5 million liras, also missing the average estimate of
116.4 million liras in a Bloomberg survey.  Steel demand is increasing after the global recession,
pushing up the price of raw materials. The price of hot rolled
coil used to make home appliances rose to about $930 per ton
from $580 per ton at the end of 2009, Steel Business Briefing
said in a report published at a conference in Istanbul today.  Arcelik’s shares fell 18 kurus, or 2.2 percent, to 7.92
liras at 4:11 p.m. after rising as much as 0.7 percent before
the earnings were released. The main  ISE National 100 index 
declined 0.3 percent.  Sales costs increased 10 percent to 4.87 billion liras last
year, outpacing sales, which rose 5.2 percent to 6.94 billion
liras, the statement said.  Arcelik foresees the margin of earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization rising to 11.5 percent this
year from 11.4 percent in 2010, it said in an e-mailed report
summarizing the earnings.  While product prices in the industry will rise this year,
unit sales are expected to increase 6-8 percent in Turkey and
10-12 percent abroad, Arcelik said.  Arcelik is owned by  Koc Holding AS , Turkey’s biggest group
of industrial and financial companies.  To contact the reporters on this story:
