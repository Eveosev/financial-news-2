Asian stocks rose, sending the
regional benchmark index to a one-week high, as an increased
forecast for U.S. economic growth from the  Federal Reserve  and
improving earnings bolstered confidence in an economic recovery.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that receives 81 percent of its
sales outside of Japan, climbed 3.9 percent in Tokyo. Honda
Motor Co., which counts  North America  as its biggest market,
advanced 1.1 percent in Tokyo. Qantas Airways Ltd.,  Australia ’s
No. 1 airline, jumped 5.4 percent in Sydney after reporting
profit that more than quadrupled. Neptune Orient Lines Ltd.,
Asia’s No. 2 container line by sales, rose 2.8 percent in  Singapore  after posting fourth-quarter profit that beat
estimates.  “Economic sentiment is improving and that is supporting
the stock market,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$450 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Investors expecting stocks to rise further are increasing”
because of positive economic data and strong corporate earnings.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.5 percent to 138.65 as
of 3:37 p.m. in Tokyo, heading for its highest close since Feb.
8. The gauge last week sank 2.7 percent after  China  raised
borrowing costs and anti-government protests intensified in  Egypt , eventually forcing President Hosni Mubarak to resign.  Of the 454 companies in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 178
have exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 138 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225  Stock Average increased 0.3 percent.
Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.2 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.3 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi
Index fell 0.6 percent.  Fed Minutes  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slipped 0.2
percent today. The index rose 0.6 percent yesterday in  New York 
to a 32-month high following the Fed’s forecast for economic
growth, improving earnings and takeovers.  Officials “continued to express disappointment in both the
pace and the unevenness of the improvements in labor markets,”
while also judging the recovery to be on a “firmer footing,”
the Federal Open Market Committee said in minutes of its Jan.
25-26 meeting, released in  Washington . Policy makers raised
projections for economic growth this year and made little change
to forecasts after 2011 or for unemployment and inflation.  Commerce Department figures showed that housing starts
climbed 15 percent to a 596,000 annual rate. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 539,000 rate. Work
started on 78 percent more dwellings with two or more units,
overshadowing a drop in single-family houses that indicates the
housing market continues to struggle.  “An improvement in the housing market and  consumer
spending  is a first step to a self-sustaining recovery,”
Ichiyoshi Investment Management’s Akino said.  Exporters Advance  Gauges of information technology and consumer discretionary
companies posted the biggest advance among the 10 industry
groups in the MSCI  Asia  Pacific Index, all of which gained.  Canon climbed 3.9 percent to 4,105 yen in Tokyo. Sony
Corp., the maker of Bravia televisions and PlayStation game
consoles, increased 1.8 percent to 3,035 yen. Samsung
Electronics Co., Asia’s largest maker of chips, flat screens and
mobile phones, rose 1 percent to 954,000 won in  Seoul .  Honda Motor, Japan’s second-biggest carmaker, advanced 1.1
percent to 3,695 yen in Tokyo. Hyundai Motor Co., South Korea’s
largest car maker, gained 1.7 percent to 178,000 won in Seoul.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 0.2 percent this year
to yesterday, compared with gains of 6.3 percent by the S&P 500
and 5.4 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 14.1 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.9 times for the S&P 500 and 11.5 times
for the Stoxx 600.  Qantas, Neptune  In Sydney, Qantas jumped 5.4 percent to A$2.52. The company
said first-half profit more than quadrupled to A$241 million
($242 million) from A$58 million a year ago as rebounding
corporate and holiday travel offset disruptions following an
Airbus SAS A380 engine explosion.  Neptune Orient Lines climbed 2.8 percent to S$2.19 in
Singapore. The company said it had a fourth-quarter net income
of $177 million, compared with a loss of $211 million a year
earlier. That beat the average estimate of $75 million by four
analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  Energy companies gained after crude oil for March delivery
rose 0.8 percent to settle at $84.99 a barrel in New York
yesterday. The contract advanced as much as 0.4 percent during
Asian trading.    Cnooc Ltd ., China’s largest offshore oil producer,
