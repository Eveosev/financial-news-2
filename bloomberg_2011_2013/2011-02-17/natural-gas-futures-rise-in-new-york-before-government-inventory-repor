Natural gas futures fell to a three-
month low after a government report showed that U.S. stockpiles
dropped less than forecast last week.  Gas declined 1.4 percent after the Energy Department said
inventories decreased 233 billion cubic feet in the week ended
Feb. 11 to 1.911 trillion cubic feet. A survey of Bloomberg
users showed an expected drop of 242 billion.  “You’ve got a little bit of disappointment relative to
what some smart money was expecting,” said  Cameron Horwitz , an
analyst in Houston at Canaccord Genuity. “This will be the last
really robust withdrawal of this heating season.”  Natural gas for March delivery fell 5.3 cents to $3.868 per
million British thermal units on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the lowest settlement price since Nov. 16. Gas traded
at $3.918 before the report was released at 10:30 a.m. The
futures have lost 12 percent this year.  The supply decline was bigger than the five-year average
drop for the week of 150 billion cubic feet, department data
showed. A deficit to the five-year average widened to 6.3
percent from 2.1 percent the previous week. A deficit to year-
earlier supplies widened to 6.9 percent from 4.4 percent.  “The lack of a bullish surprise was enough to keep the
market pointed lower and focused, at least for now, on current
warmer-than-normal temperatures,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in New York, in e-mailed
comments.  Gas inventories may total 1.651 trillion cubic feet by the
end of March, down from 1.662 trillion a year earlier, the
Energy Department estimated on Feb. 8 in its monthly Short-Term
Energy Outlook.  Weather Outlook  Temperatures will be higher than average this week and will
be in a normal range in New York,  New Jersey ,  Pennsylvania , and
Midwestern states from Feb. 22 to Feb. 26, according to the  National Weather Service .  The high temperature in New York on Feb. 24 may be 44
degrees Fahrenheit (7 Celsius), 1 degree above normal, according
to  AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College , Pennsylvania. The high in  Chicago  may be 38, 1 degree below normal.  About 52 percent of U.S. households use natural gas for
heating, according to the Energy Department.  “I am looking for the market to continue to drift lower,”
said Brad Florer, a trader at Kottke Associates Inc., an energy
trading firm in Louisville, Kentucky. “The cold is going to
become less and less an issue.”  Pipeline Flows  Heating demand will be 7 percent below normal levels in the
Northeast through Feb. 24, according to Weather Derivatives in
Belton,  Missouri .  Gas shipments scheduled for delivery to households in the
U.S. slid for a second day on forecasts of warmer weather.  Scheduled gas deliveries for residential use in the U.S.
and  Canada  fell 11 percent to 31.4 million dekatherms (30.6
billion cubic feet), according to data compiled by Bloomberg as
of 12:43 p.m. in  New York .  Gas futures volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was
252,417 as of 2:42 p.m., compared with the three-month average
of 303,000. Volume was 289,593 yesterday. Open interest was
949,674 contracts. The three-month average open interest is
810,000.  The exchange has a one-business-day delay in reporting open
interest and full volume data.  To contact the reporters on this story:
