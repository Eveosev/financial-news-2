India’s rupee strengthened on
speculation the government will announce plans to sell state
assets and improve public finances in this month’s budget.  Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee may pledge to shrink the  budget deficit  to as low as 4.5 percent of gross domestic
product in the next fiscal year from an estimated 5.5 percent in
the 12 months ending March 31, Sudarshan Bhatt, chief currency
trader at  Corporation Bank  in Mumbai, said today. The rupee also
advanced on optimism this month’s decline in crude-oil prices
will help reduce the nation’s import costs.  “The rupee has a positive bias ahead of the budget as the
government may promise further cuts in the fiscal deficit and
make progress with the privatization process,” Bhatt said.
“Softer oil prices also have helped improve currency-market
sentiment.”  The rupee strengthened 0.4 percent to 45.3475 per dollar as
of the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  India ’s currency and bond markets were shut yesterday
for a public holiday. The rupee will rise to 45.30 next week and
to 45.10 before the Feb. 28 budget, Bhatt predicted.  The Indian currency will appreciate to 45 per dollar by
March 31 and to 43.80 by the end of this year, according to the
median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 46.12
per dollar in three months, compared with 46.24 on Feb. 15.
