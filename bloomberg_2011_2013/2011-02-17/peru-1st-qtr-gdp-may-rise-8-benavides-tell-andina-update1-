Peruvian Finance Minister Ismael Benavides said the Andean country’s economy will grow “at
least” 8 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.  Gross domestic product can “easily” rise 7.5 percent this
year given the current pace of growth, though it isn’t likely to
match last year’s 8.8 percent increase, Benavides said in an
interview with state news agency  Andina .  The government will increase 2011 tax collection 10 percent
from last year, offsetting a cut in the sales tax to 18 percent
from 19 percent approved last week, Andina said citing
Benavides.  Peru should have a sales tax of no more than 16 percent,
though reducing it to that level will depend on the development
of the economy, he said according to the agency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
