 The  World Trade Organization  will
issue a interim report tomorrow that says  China  has no legal
basis to restrict exports of nine raw materials, including zinc,
the Wall Street Journal said, citing unidentified lawyers and
diplomats familiar with the case.  The WTO will mail the preliminary report, which wonâ€™t be
made public, to participating parties tomorrow and then issue a
final ruling in April, after which China can appeal, the
newspaper reported on its website today.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
