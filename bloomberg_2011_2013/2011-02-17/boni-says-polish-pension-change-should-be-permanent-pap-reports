Planned changes to  Poland ’s pension
system must be permanent to ensure they help the government
narrow the budget deficit and curb public debt in the long term,
PAP newswire reported, citing Michal Boni, senior adviser to
Prime Minister  Donald Tusk .  The government intends to cut transfers to private pension
funds to 2.3 percent of employees’ salaries from 7.3 percent at
present, moving the rest to the state-run pension system, in an
effort to curb the soaring budget deficit and keep public debt
below a legal threshold of 55 percent of gross domestic product.  “It’s impossible to lower the contributions temporarily,”
Boni said today, according to PAP. “The measures we’re taking
to change the pension system will reduce the threat of public
debt and the  budget deficit  now and in the coming years.”  The government should take further steps to consolidate
Poland’s public finances in addition to the pension system
changes, Boni said, according to PAP.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
