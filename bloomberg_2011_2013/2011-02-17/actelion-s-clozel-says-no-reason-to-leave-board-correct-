(Corrects quotation in first paragraph.)    Actelion Ltd . Chief Executive
Officer Jean-Paul Clozel said he doesn’t see any reason he
should leave the company’s board. Investors who want “fast
money” aren’t going to succeed in destabilizing the company, he
said in an interview.  “I don’t think there’s any reason why I should step down
from the board,” Clozel said in an interview. Having no members
of management on the board “has absolutely no reason.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
