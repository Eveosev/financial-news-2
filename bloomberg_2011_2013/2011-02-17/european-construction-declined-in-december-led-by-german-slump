European construction output
declined for a second month in December, led by a slump in  Germany ,  Europe ’s largest economy, caused by cold weather.  Construction in the euro region slipped 1.8 percent from
November, when it fell 0.9 percent, the European Union’s 
statistics office  in Luxembourg said today. From a year earlier,
output decreased 12 percent after dropping a revised 6.3 percent
in the previous month.  German economic growth slowed in the fourth quarter as
unusually cold temperatures curbed construction output. While
the 17-nation euro-region economy is showing signs of gathering
some strength as export demand fuels orders, governments are
stepping up austerity measures and cutting spending, such as on
road projects and new buildings.  In Germany, construction output dropped 24 percent in
December from the previous month, when it fell 1.5 percent,
today’s report showed. Output slipped 4.1 percent in  France  and
1.6 percent in the Netherlands. The statistics office didn’t
provide figures for Spain, Ireland or  Greece .  The statistics office previously said November construction
output fell 6.8 percent from a year earlier. In the European
Union, output dropped 3.1 percent in the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
