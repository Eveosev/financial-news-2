  Ecolab Inc ., the world’s largest
maker of cleaning chemicals for hotels and restaurants, plans to
eliminate about 900 jobs in Europe in a reorganization.  Cost-cutting measures will reduce expenses by more than
$100 million a year, including as much as $5 million in 2011,  St. Paul , Minnesota-based Ecolab said today in a statement.
About 3 percent of global workers and 12 percent of European
employees will be cut, said Michael J. Monahan, an Ecolab
spokesman. The actions will cost about $125 million over three
years, including $40 million to $60 million in 2011, Ecolab said
in the statement.  Ecolab said the changes it’s making in Europe include
alterations to supply-chain management and the consolidation of
offices. The company will see an improvement of about 5
percentage points in its operating margin in its  Europe , Middle
East and Africa operations over three years, Chief Executive
Officer Douglas Baker said in the statement.  Ecolab fell $2.19, or 4.4 percent, to $47.55 as of 11:22
a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  Fourth-quarter net income rose 13 percent to $131.3
million, or 56 cents a share, from $115.8 million, or 48 cents,
a year earlier, Ecolab said. Profit excluding restructuring
costs was 60 cents a share, the company said. That trails the
61-cent average estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
Sales rose 0.7 percent to $1.58 billion.  First-quarter profit will be 42 cents to 45 cents a share,
Ecolab said. That’s less than the 48-cent average estimate of
eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Full-year profit will be
$2.47 to $2.53 a share, the company said. The average estimate
of 13 analysts was $2.52.  To contact the reporter on this story:
