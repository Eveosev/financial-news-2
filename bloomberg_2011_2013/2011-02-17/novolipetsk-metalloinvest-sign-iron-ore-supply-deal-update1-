OAO Metalloinvest,  Russia ’s largest
iron ore producer, agreed to supply 21.6 million metric tons of
pellets to OAO Novolipetsk Steel, or NLMK, over four years.  “Prices will be determined using a formula reflecting
pricing dynamics in the international iron ore market,”
Novolipetsk said today in a statement. The agreement will ensure
“stable pellet supply to NLMK’s expanding production facilities
in Lipetsk,” it said.  Novolipetsk, Russia’s third-largest steelmaker, has a 27-
square-kilometer (10-square-mile) production facility in
Lipetsk, about 500 kilometers south of Moscow. Its output
includes slabs, hot- and cold-rolled steel and galvanized
products.  “It’s a very good contract for NLMK,” said Dmitry Smolin,
an analyst at Uralsib Capital in Moscow who values the contract
at $3.2 billion. “This year we expect the average price of
pellets to be $145 a ton, 38 percent higher than in 2010.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
