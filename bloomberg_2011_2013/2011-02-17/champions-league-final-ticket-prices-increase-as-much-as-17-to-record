Supporters will be asked to pay the
highest-ever prices to watch the Champions League final this
year, according to a price list released by European soccer’s
governing body today.  The most expensive of the 61,000 seats available to the
general public for the game at Wembley Stadium,  London , costs
350 euros ($476), 17 percent up on the comparable ticket last
year in  Madrid . Second-tier places are up 15.5 percent to 260
euros, and the third category costs 175 euros, 13 percent more.
Only fans of the two finalists will be able to buy the cheapest
95-euro seats.  “We have to benchmark this event against other comparable
events like, for example, the final of the European Championship,
the  World Cup ,”  UEFA’s  event director Giorgio Marchetti told
reporters in London. “It’s still priced below comparable
events.”  The Champions League final is the most-watched annual
sports event, according to UEFA. Last season’s final, the first
since it was moved to a Saturday, peaked at more than 140
million viewers. Marchetti said the May 28 final will gross 14
million euros, 3 million more than the 2010 final between Inter
Milan and  Bayern Munich  at Madrid’s Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.  UEFA President  Michel Platini  had said the traditional
Wednesday evening slot meant it wasn’t accessible to school-age
children. Marchetti said UEFA was still committed to getting
young people into the stadium.  “That’s also why we put some tickets for children at a
discounted price,” he said. A special adult-child combined
ticket costs 400 euros, which is a 50 percent discount for the
child, according to Marchetti.  To contact the reporter on this story:
