Spain’s  IBEX 35 Index  advanced for a
third day, gaining 65.2, or 0.6 percent, to 11,113 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Madrid. The Madrid Stock Exchange General Index
also climbed 0.6 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Spanish market. Symbols are in parentheses after company names.    Almirall SA  (ALM SM) climbed for a third day in four,
gaining 1 percent to 8.89 euros. The Spanish drugmaker said its
Sativex drug won approval for public financing in Spain. It is
the first cannabis-derived treatment to be approved in the
country, the company said in a regulatory filing.    Amper SA  (AMP SM) dropped for a second day in three, losing
1.3 percent to 3.75 euros. The Spanish company started talks
with unions to “adjust resources and labor costs in Spain to
market activity,” the company said in a regulatory filing
today.    Fomento de Construcciones y Contratas SA  (FCC SM) fell 0.8
percent to 22.91 euros, snapping four days of gains. The Spanish
builder shelved the presentation of a three-year strategic plan
that it had expected to make public in March, Cinco Dias said,
citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. FCC had
previously published a strategic plan every three years
detailing sales and investment targets, the newspaper added.  Indra Sistemas SA (IDR SM) rose 1.3 percent to 14.35 euros,
extending yesterday’s gain, after rival Cap Gemini said full-
year profit rose 57 percent to 280 million euros ($379.2
million) on stronger demand for its technology, beating
analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
