Tropical cyclone Bingiza could lead
to further flooding in  Madagascar  and  Mozambique  where heavy
rains have left soils saturated and people without homes,
according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs.  Between 4,000 and 9,600 households, equivalent to as many
as 48,000 people, are likely to be affected by flooding in the
Zambezi river valley in Mozambique,  OCHA , as the organization is
known, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Flooding in southern Africa has affected South Africa,
Mozambique, Madagascar, Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola during the
last eight weeks. Crop damage in South  Africa , the continent’s
largest economy, could cost the nation more than $282 million
after grape farms were submerged, while OCHA estimates that
almost 1 percent of Mozambique’s crops have been destroyed by
rising water.  Floods in Lesotho, a mountainous, land-locked country
surrounded by  South Africa , lost at least 672 homes and more
than 4,700 livestock to floods that led to outbreaks of diarrhea
and dysentery in both humans and animal herds, OCHA said.  In Angola, floods have displaced 34,380 people and killed
22, the UN organization said. “Those made homeless have been
placed at shelter camps, staying in tents provided by the
government,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
