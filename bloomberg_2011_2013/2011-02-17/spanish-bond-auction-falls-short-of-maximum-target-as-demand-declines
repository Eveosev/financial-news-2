  Spain  sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.8
billion) of bonds today, less than the maximum target, as demand
declined. Bonds fell after the sale.  The Treasury sold 2.47 billion euros of 10-year bonds at an
average yield of 5.2 percent, the Bank of Spain in  Madrid  said,
compared with 5.446 percent the last time similar securities
were sold on Dec. 16. It also sold 998 million euros of bonds
due Jan. 31, 2037 at an average yield of 5.957 percent. It had
planned to sell a maximum of 4 billion euros in total.  Demand for the 10-year paper was 1.54 times the amount
sold, compared with 1.67 at the December auction. The bid-to-
cover ratio for the 2037 debt was 1.53, compared with 1.99 when
the paper was sold a year ago.  The gap between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing costs
widened for the first time in three days, to 216 basis points
after the sale from 210 basis points yesterday. That compares
with a euro-era high of 298 basis points reached on Nov. 30 and
an average of 15 basis points in the monetary union’s first
decade.  “It’s disappointing, we were expecting the auction to go
fairly well,” said  Harvinder Sian , a senior bond strategist at
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc in  London . “It’s not a disaster but
the market is in no mood for a nuanced debate.”  Cajas Decree  Investor demand for Spanish bonds is “stable,” Deputy
Finance Minister Jose Manuel Campa told reporters yesterday in
Madrid. He said market conditions will remain “favorable.”
Spain plans to sell 192 billion euros of debt in gross terms
this year and has its first bond redemptions in April.  The country is stepping up efforts to convince investors it
can shore up its struggling savings banks without overburdening
public finances. The government plans to approve a decree
tomorrow to tighten capital requirements for lenders and set a
deadline for them to reach the new levels or risk partial
nationalization.  The Socialist government is also implementing the deepest
budget cuts in at least three decades, aiming to slash the
deficit to 6 percent of gross domestic product this year -- in
line with  France ’s shortfall -- from a targeted 9.3 percent last
year, when the shortfall was the euro region’s third-largest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
