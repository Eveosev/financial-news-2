The European Commission told  France 
that tax breaks for construction of rental housing within the
country must be extended to French taxpayers who invest in
similar projects in other European countries,  Les Echos 
reported.  The Commission said that restricting tax benefits to
projects with France was “incompatible” with European Union
policies encouraging free flow of capital within the region, the
newspaper said, citing a ruling on a complaint filed in 2009 by
a French investor.  France will provide an estimated 880 million euros in tax
benefits this year to investors in rental-housing construction
within the country,  Les Echos  said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
