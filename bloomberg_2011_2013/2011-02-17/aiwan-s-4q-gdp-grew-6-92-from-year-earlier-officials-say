Taiwan’s economy grew at a 6.92
percent annual pace in the fourth quarter, according to two
officials who attended a meeting of the government-charged panel
that reviews the figure.  The two spoke on condition of anonymity because the gross
domestic product report has yet to be publicly released. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey of eight economists
was for an increase of 6.4 percent. The government’s preliminary
estimate on Jan. 31 was 6.48 percent.  The central bank is striving to avert a property bubble
after raising borrowing costs three times in 2010 as the
recovery stoked  home prices . Overall inflation is set to quicken
and climbing wages are boosting scope to increase rates again,
said Australia & New Zealand Banking Group’s Raymond Yeung.  “The momentum of higher prices is building because of
rising food costs,” Hong Kong-based Yeung said before the
release. Officials may raise borrowing costs at the next policy
meeting in March by as much as a quarter of a percentage point
from the current level of 1.625 percent, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
