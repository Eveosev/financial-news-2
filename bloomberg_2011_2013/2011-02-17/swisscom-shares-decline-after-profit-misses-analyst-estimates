  Swisscom AG ,  Switzerland ’s largest
phone company, fell the most since April in Zurich trading
after reporting that fourth-quarter profit declined 3 percent,
missing analyst estimates.  Swisscom dropped as much as 4 percent. Net income declined
to 388 million Swiss francs ($404 million) from 400 million
francs a year earlier, the  Bern-based company said  today.
Revenue fell to 3.01 billion francs from 3.08 billion francs.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated net income of 431
million francs on sales of 3.04 billion francs. Swisscom
proposed a dividend of 21 francs a share.  “Fourth-quarter numbers and dividend missed
expectations,” Serge Rotzer, an analyst at Bank Vontobel,
wrote in a note. “The outlook will provoke negative earnings
revision in the market.”  Swisscom predicted 2011 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization of more than 4.6 billion francs.
A drop in 2010 Ebitda was primarily caused by a provision of
102 million francs for proceeds against  FastWeb SPA , it said.
Swisscom has been dealing with an investigation of alleged
value-added-tax fraud and money laundering at FastWeb ,  Italy ’s
second-biggest fixed-line company, which it bought in 2007.  Swisscom fell as much as 17.4 francs to 416.1 francs and
traded at 417.7 francs as of 9:52 a.m. The company has a market
value of 21.6 billion francs.  FastWeb’s fourth-quarter net loss widened to 83.1 million
euros ($113 million) from 64.9 million euros a year earlier.
Swisscom said today that it plans to delist FastWeb by the end
of March.  Swisscom forecast 2011 revenue of at least 11.8 billion
francs, and a dividend of at least 21 francs per share if all
targets are met.  Transitional Year  “After a transitional year in 2011 -- no revenue growth,
but a slightly higher Ebitda -- Swisscom expects FastWeb to
achieve strong revenue and cash-flow growth in the following
years due to the introduction of go-to-market initiatives and
increases in efficiency,” the company said in the release.  Full-year revenue for 2010 was little changed at 11.99
billion francs. Ebitda fell 1.9 percent to 4.6 billion francs.
The Swiss company had forecast total net revenue of about 12
billion francs and Ebitda of about 4.7 billion francs,
including a provision for the VAT proceedings against FastWeb.  The outlook is based on assumed exchange rate of 1.30
francs to the euro for the conversion of FastWeb’s results. The
exchange rate assumption assumes “uncertainty” regarding
currency movements, it said.  The dividend of 21 francs for 2010 “is a major
disappointment for me, especially for a defensive company which
yields around 4.8 percent in a sector yielding as high as 8.7
percent,” said Saeed Baradar, a telecommunications sales
specialist at Societe Generale in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
