The $9 billion auction of 30-year
Treasury Inflation Protected Securities attracted strong demand
after a government report showed consumer prices rose in January
at the fastest annual pace in eight months.  Indirect bidders, an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 55.2 percent of the bonds today, the most
at any of the three sales since the maturity was reintroduced in
February 2010. The bond yielded 2.19 percent. Improving economic
data and a rally in prices for riskier assets such as stocks and
high-yield bonds have fueled speculation the economic recovery
is gaining momentum.  “The strong demand reflected boosted growth
expectations,” said Eric Van Nostrand, an interest-rate
strategist in  New York  at Credit Suisse Group AG, one of the 20
primary dealers that are required to bid at U.S. debt auctions.
“People are starting to price in the possibility of
inflation.”  The yield on 30-year inflation-indexed bonds maturing in
August 2040 fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to
2.15 percent at 4:18 p.m. in New York, according to BGCantor
Market data. It touched 2.14 percent, the lowest since Feb. 8 on
an intraday basis. The price rose 27/32, or $8.44 per $1,000
face value, to 99 17/32.  TIPS pay interest on a principal amount that rises with
consumer prices. Their face value is protected against
deflation, because the principal can’t fall below par.  The  consumer price index  gained 1.6 percent in January from
a year earlier, Labor Department data showed today in  Washington . It was the most since the 2 percent recorded in May.  Break-Even Spread  The 30-year break-even spread, the difference between
yields on the securities and conventional U.S. 30-year bonds,
has surged since Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
on Aug. 27 policy makers were “prepared to provide additional
monetary accommodation through unconventional measures” to
revive the economy and boost inflation expectations.  The break-even rate, a gauge of traders’ expectations for
inflation, has increased to 2.52 percentage points today, from
1.96 percentage points on Aug. 26, the day before Bernanke spoke
at a conference in Jackson Hole,  Wyoming . The 10-year spread has
climbed to 2.28 percentage points, from 1.57.  Since Oct. 14, when an auction of conventional 30-year
bonds drew lower-than-average demand amid speculation the Fed
would concentrate its purchases of  U.S. government debt  on 2- to
10-year notes, the 30-year break-even rate has traded between
2.46 percentage points and 2.66 percentage points.  ‘Certainly Helped’  “The inflation number certainly helped” at today’s
auction, said  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. interest-rate
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in
New York, a primary dealer. “You were at the low end of the
range, and that probably helped bring in some buyers.”  Indirect bidders bought 38.9 percent of the bonds at the
last 30-year TIPS sale on Aug. 23.  Direct bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 3.6 percent of
the securities today. That compared with 28 percent at the
August auction.  Thirty-year TIPS were sold in February 2010 for the first
time since 2001, when the Treasury stopped selling all so-called
long bonds. The U.S. introduced a 20-year inflation-indexed bond
in 2004, which it stopped selling in 2009 to make room on the
auction calendar for 30-year TIPS. Today’s offering was the
ninth since the securities were introduced in 1998.  To contact the reporter on this story:
