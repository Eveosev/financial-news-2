  Brazil ’s Center South sugar cane
output may climb up to 4.1 percent in the next 2011-12
marketing season, according to the  International Sugar
Organization .  Crushing may rise to between 570 million and 579 million
metric tons in the area, Leonardo Bichara Rocha, senior
economist at the ISO, said by phone today. The output in the
current season was 556.2 million tons as of Feb. 1, according to
the Brazilian Sugarcane Industry Association, or Unica.  Center South accounts for 90 percent of sugar output in
Brazil, the world’s biggest producer. Sugar production may rise
by 2 million tons to between 35.5 million and 36 million tons in
2011-12, Rocha said. Exports in the period may increase by as
much as 2 million tons, he said.  The portion of cane used to make sugar rather than ethanol
probably will rise to 47 percent, Rocha said. As of Feb. 1, 44.7
percent of all cane processed in Center South in the current
season had been directed to sugar production, Unica figures
show.  International sugar prices are likely to stay above 25
cents a pound for the 2011-12 season, Rocha said. The sweetener
for May delivery last traded at 29.37 cents in  New York .  The London-based ISO plans to release its 2011-12 estimates
for Brazil on Feb. 25, Rocha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
