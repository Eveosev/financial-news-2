  San Francisco  Bay Area home prices
fell for the fourth straight month in January as foreclosures
made up more than a third of all purchases, DataQuick
Information Systems Inc. said.  The median price for houses and condominiums in the nine-
county region fell to $338,000, down 9.9 percent from $375,000
in December and 3.4 percent from $350,000 in January 2010, the
San Diego-based data seller said today in a statement. The
streak of year-over-year declines follows 12 months of advances.  “Last month’s activity was a continuation of trends we saw
much of last year,”  John Walsh , DataQuick president, said in
the statement. “The market is still dominated by distress sales
and bargain hunting. We’re seeing little discretionary
activity.”  Sales totaled 4,966, up 2.3 percent from a year earlier and
down 31 percent from December. Foreclosures were 35 percent of
total sales, the highest share since February 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
