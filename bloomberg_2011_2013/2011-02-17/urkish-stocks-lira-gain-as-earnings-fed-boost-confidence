decline for the year to less than 0.1 percent. The lira added
0.3 percent to 1.5792 per dollar.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months increased 0.1 percent, the New York-based
group said today, indicating economic growth will extend into
this year. The Federal Reserve said yesterday that the world’s
largest economy is on a “firmer footing.”    Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS  jumped 3.8 percent to 7.72
liras, its highest level in a month, and Akbank TAS, part-owned
by Citigroup Inc., rallied 3.3 percent. The ISE National Bank
Index of Turkish lenders rose 2 percent, the most in two weeks.  The yield on two-year bonds rose 2 basis points to 8.28
