More Americans than projected filed
first-time claims for  unemployment insurance  last week, a sign
the improvement in the labor market will take time to develop.  Applications for jobless benefits increased by 25,000 to
410,000 in the week ended Feb. 12, exceeding the 400,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor
Department figures showed today. The total number of people
receiving unemployment insurance was little changed, while those
collecting extended payments decreased.  A reduction in firings by U.S. firms is needed to keep
unemployment going down. Bigger job gains are needed to boost  consumer spending , which accounts for 70 percent of the world’s
largest economy.  “Conditions in the labor market will continue to be
tenuous as firms look for a sustained pickup in sales,” Maxwell
Clarke, chief U.S. economist at IDEAglobal in  New York , said
before the report. “Claims should remain at an elevated level
for some time but should continue along a gradual downward path
in the months to come.”  Another Labor Department report showed the cost of living
climbed for a seventh consecutive month in January, led by
higher prices for fuel and food that that may be starting to
filter through to other goods and services.  The consumer-price index increased 0.4 percent for a second
month, more than the 0.3 percent median increase estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg. The so-called core rate, which
excludes volatile food and fuel costs, rose 0.2 percent, the
biggest gain since October 2009.  More Than Forecast  Jobless claims estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 47
economists ranged from 370,000 to 450,000. The Labor Department
revised the prior week’s two-year low to 385,000 from 383,000.  Today’s report covers the week the Labor Department surveys
businesses to calculate the monthly payroll figures. The four-
week moving average, a less volatile measure, rose to 417,750
from 416,000 the prior week. The average was also up from the
413,000 in last month’s survey week, indicating little letup in
firings.  The number of people continuing to collect jobless benefits
rose by 1,000 in the week ended Feb. 5 to 3.91 million. These
figures do not include the number of workers receiving extended
benefits under federal programs.  Those who’ve used up their traditional benefits and are now
collecting emergency and extended payments decreased by about
85,000 to 4.5 million in the week ended Jan. 29.  Jobless Rate  The  unemployment rate  among people eligible for benefits,
which tends to track the jobless rate, held at 3.1 percent for a
third week.  Thirty-two states and territories reported a decrease in
claims, while 21 had an increase.  Initial jobless claims reflect weekly firings and tend to
fall as job growth -- measured by the monthly non-farm payrolls
report -- accelerates.  Central bank policy makers are likely to keep  interest
rates  near zero and press ahead with plans to buy $600 billion
in  Treasury securities  to boost the pace of recovery until they
see signs of sustained  job creation .  Employers added a fewer-than-forecast 36,000 jobs to
payrolls in January as the unemployment rate unexpectedly fell
to 9 percent, the lowest since April 2009, according to Labor
Department figures released Feb. 4. Unemployment dropped to 9.4
percent in December from 9.8 percent the previous month.    Home Depot Inc ., the world’s largest home-improvement
retailer, this week said it is hiring more than 60,000 temporary
workers in the U.S., as well as adding permanent employees for
the second year in a row.  Sales Staff  The Atlanta-based company is boosting staff as it prepares
for the biggest selling season of the year, March through mid-
June, Craig Menear, executive vice president of merchandising,
said in a telephone interview Feb. 14.  “It is about driving traffic,” he said.  Other companies are cutting workers. Continental Airlines
said Feb. 7 it will eliminate 500 jobs in Houston as it combines
with  United Airlines , moving its headquarters to  Chicago  from
the Texas city where an estimated 3,000 people in management and
administration are employed.  “We’re going through a careful process of trying to
determine the right organizational structure and location for
each department,”  Julie King , a spokeswoman for Continental,
said in an interview.  To contact the reporters on this story:
