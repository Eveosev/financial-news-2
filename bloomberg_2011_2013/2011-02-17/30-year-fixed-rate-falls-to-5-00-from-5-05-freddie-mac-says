  Mortgage rates  for 30-year U.S.
loans declined for the first time in five weeks, reducing
borrowing costs from a 10-month high.  The average rate for 30-year fixed loans fell to 5 percent
for the week ended today from 5.05 percent, according to Freddie
Mac. The average 15-year rate was 4.27 percent, down from 4.29
percent a week earlier, the McLean, Virginia-based mortgage-  finance company  said in a statement.  The decline follows a surge in rates that sent demand for
U.S. mortgages to a two-year low. A lasting housing recovery has
been held back by mounting foreclosures and 21 straight months
of unemployment of at least 9 percent.  “The housing market is struggling to regain traction
despite still historically low rates,” Frank Nothaft, vice
president and chief economist for  Freddie Mac , said in the
statement.  The  Mortgage Bankers Association ’s index of loan
applications decreased 9.5 percent in the week ended Feb. 11 to
the lowest point since November 2008, dragged down by a plunge
in refinancing.  The Washington-based group’s refinancing measure dropped 11
percent, and its gauge of purchases fell 5.9 percent. The share
of mortgage applicants seeking to refinance slid to 64 percent,
the lowest level since May, from 66.6 percent the previous week.  Refinancing Decline  Refinancing will drop substantially through the year, said
Matt Howlett, an analyst at Macquarie Group Ltd. in  New York .  “We see very little sensitivity in terms of refinancing to
minimum rate changes,” Howlett said in an interview.
Refinancing would pick up only if “there were some other
government stimulus that hasn’t already been constructed. And
that just seems unlikely,” he said.  Housing starts rose 15 percent in January to a 596,000
annual rate, the U.S. Commerce Department said yesterday. The
gain was buoyed by a 78 percent increase in multifamily homes,
where new building has been below expectations for several
months, according to the  National Association of Home Builders ,
a Washington-based trade association.  Construction on single-family homes fell 1 percent in
January to a 413,000 annual pace, the lowest level since May
2009, the Commerce Department said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
