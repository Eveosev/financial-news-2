Chambers representing Hungarian
retailers may get the right to block building projects such as
stores planned by multinational companies, under legislation
proposed by the government,  Magyar Nemzet  reported.  Stores of more than 2,500 square meters (27,000 square
feet) would require the approval of the Hungarian Chamber of
Commerce and Industry, allowing small retailers to veto the
expansion plans of international companies, the newspaper said
today, citing the draft legislation.  The domestic economy can’t be strong without the “bulk”
of trade being in Hungarian hands or “at least serving national
interests,” Kristof Szatmary, the secretary of state at the  Economy Ministry , told Magyar Nemzet.  Editors: Alan Purkiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
