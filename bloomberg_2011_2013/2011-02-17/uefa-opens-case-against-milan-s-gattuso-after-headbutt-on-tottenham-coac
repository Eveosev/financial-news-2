European soccer’s governing body
opened a disciplinary case against AC Milan captain Gennaro
Gattuso after the soccer player headbutted a Tottenham coach at
the end of his team’s 1-0 defeat in the Champions League.  Television footage showed Gattuso pushing his forehead into
the face of Spurs coach Joe Jordan while they exchanged words
after the match in Milan two days ago. UEFA opened a case
against the player today, and its disciplinary panel will hear
the case Feb. 21, according to a statement on the governing
body’s website.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
