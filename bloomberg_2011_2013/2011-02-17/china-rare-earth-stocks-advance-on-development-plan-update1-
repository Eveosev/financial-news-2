Rare-earth companies in  China , the
world’s biggest producer, rose in Shanghai and Shenzhen trading
after the government announced plans to develop the industry.  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. rose as
much as 8.9 percent to 80.20 yuan, the highest since Nov. 15, in
Shanghai, trading at 77.18 yuan as of 10:13 a.m. local time.
China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and
Construction Co. gained 2.3 percent to 32.48 yuan in Shenzhen.
Rising Nonferrous Metals Share Co. surged as much as 8.9 percent
to 75.35 yuan in Shanghai, trading at 72.87 yuan at 10:44 a.m.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said yesterday China will promote new
technology in the industry and accelerate the pace of mergers
and acquisitions among rare-earth producers under a five-year
plan. The country controls more than 95 percent of the world’s
supply of rare earths, a group of 17 chemically similar elements
used in hybrid cars, iPods and weapons.  China will take “stricter” measures to control mining of
rare earths and lift environmental standards, while continuing
to cap production and exports with the quota system, the
official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing Wen at a State
Council meeting yesterday. China will encourage the development
of large rare-earth companies, as well as controlling the scale
of mines and boosting management, the China Securities Journal
reported yesterday.  Lynas Corp., building a A$550 million ($552 million) rare
earths project in  Australia , advanced as much as 2.3 percent to
A$1.965 today in Sydney, trading at A$1.955 as of 10:35 a.m.
Shanghai time.  Molycorp Inc ., owner of the world’s largest rare-
earth deposit outside of China, gained 1.2 percent to $48.87
yesterday in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.  China’s policy of slashing exports of the metals soured
ties with major users including the U.S. and Japan, and caused
prices to surge.  The government introduced its export quota system for rare
earths in 1999. Last July, the country said it would slash
exports 72 percent to meet domestic demand and preserve reserves.
That was followed in December by a 35 percent cut in quotas to
14,446 tons for the first half of 2011.  --Helen Yuan and Jiang Jianguo. Editors: Alan Soughley, Indranil Ghosh  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story
