  Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced to its
strongest level since 2007 on speculation the central bank will
boost its policy rate further to damp inflation. Bonds rose.    Bank Indonesia  raised its  reference rate  by 25 basis points
to 6.75 percent on Feb. 4, the first increase in more than two
years, after consumer prices rose the most in 21 months in
January. The rupiah has strengthened 1.1 percent this year, the
best performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies.  “Bank Indonesia is giving strong signals to the market
that it wants to help combat inflation, and one way of doing
that is by increasing the interest rate,” said Eric Alexander Sugandi, a Jakarta-based economist at Standard Chartered Plc.
“It is also allowing the rupiah to appreciate to control
imported inflation.”  The rupiah gained 0.1 percent to 8,883 per dollar as of
4:02 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 8,873 earlier, the strongest level since June 2007.  The currency may average 8,900 to 9,000 to the dollar this
year, Bambang Permadi Brodjonegoro, head of fiscal policy at the  Finance Ministry , said in Jakarta today.  ‘Further Appreciation’    Southeast Asia ’s largest economy may expand 6.5 percent in
the first quarter from a year earlier, and inflation in February
may accelerate 0.2 percent to 0.5 percent from the previous
month, Brodjonegoro, said.  Consumer prices in Southeast Asia’s largest economy climbed
7.02 percent in January from 6.96 percent in December. The
country’s gross domestic product grew 6.9 percent in the fourth
quarter, the most since 2004. Indonesia’s exports rose 25.7
percent in December from a year earlier.  “There is some room for further appreciation” in the
rupiah, Milan Zavadjil, the International Monetary Fund’s senior
resident representative for Indonesia, wrote in an e-mail to
Bloomberg News today. “We do not believe the rupiah is
overvalued. This is confirmed by the strong recent performance
of exports.”  Ten-year  government bonds  gained. The yield on the 8.25
percent note due July 2021 slipped two basis points to 8.88
percent, according to closing prices from the Inter-Dealer
Market Association. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
