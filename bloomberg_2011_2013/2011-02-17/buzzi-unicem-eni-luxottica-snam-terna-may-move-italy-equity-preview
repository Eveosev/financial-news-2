Italy’s benchmark  FTSE MIB Index 
ended little changed, rising 10.8, or 0.1 percent, to 23,178.38
at the 5:30 p.m. close in Milan.  The following stocks were among the most active in the
Italian market today.    Astaldi SpA  (AST IM) increased 2.2 percent to 5.66 euros as
Italy’s second-biggest builder said it won a 215 million-euro
($292.4 million) contract to build a new metro line in
Bucharest.  Buzzi Unicem SpA (BZU IM) dropped 3.4 percent to 10.35
euros, snapping a six-day winning streak. Citigroup Inc.
downgraded Italy’s second-biggest cement maker to “sell” from
“hold,” citing in a note the stock’s recent performance.
Citigroup also said Buzzi and Holcim Ltd. are its “least
preferred stocks” among pan-European building materials
companies.    Fondiaria-SAI SpA  (FSA IM) added 2.8 percent to 7.03 euros,
rising for a third day. Cheuvreux SA reiterated its
“outperform” rating on Italy’s second-biggest insurer, saying
in a note that the stock is “cheap.” The brokerage also said
that Groupama SA wants “to gain control of Fondiaria if the
Ligresti family decides to sell.”  Milano Assicurazioni SpA (MI IM), a unit of Fondiaria,
increased 1.9 percent to 1.23 euros.    Saipem SpA  (SPM IM), Europe’s largest oil-services company,
advanced 1.5 percent to 37.70 euros, tracking gains in Technip

a profit in the fourth quarter and said demand for offshore,
