  Zimbabwe  may soon start exporting
beef to the European Union again, the Herald reported, citing
Agriculture Minister Joseph Made.  Zimbabwe is working on improving its livestock management
systems to comply with EU standards, the Harare-based, state-
owned newspaper cited Made as saying. Made’s comments followed a
meeting with the EU’s top envoy to Zimbabwe, Aldo Dell’ Ariccia,
the  Herald  reported.  The EU stopped beef imports from Zimbabwe after a livestock
disease outbreak, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
