U.S. government authorities are
expanding their search for illegal immigrants by examining the
records of another 1,000 companies, a federal official said.  No one industry is being targeted by the audits, said Kelly
Nantel, a spokeswoman for  Immigration and Customs Enforcement ,
who declined to name the companies involved. The unnamed
employers are in addition to more than 3,580 companies that have
been audited since January 2009, resulting in $54 million in
fines, Nantel said. ICE says it targets companies based on tips
and not by industry.  “The inspections touch on employers of all sizes and in
every state in the nation,” she said in an e-mail today.  Under President  Barack Obama , ICE has moved away from the
Bush administration’s high-profile workplace raids that detained
employees. The new effort is geared more to holding companies
accountable by auditing employee-immigration status forms, which
employers are required to keep on file.  The Wall Street Journal reported on the new audits today.  Those fined last year included waste-removal, food,
furniture, agricultural and construction companies and even
health spas, according to the agency. ICE said it arrested 187
employers on criminal charges last year compared with 114
employers in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
