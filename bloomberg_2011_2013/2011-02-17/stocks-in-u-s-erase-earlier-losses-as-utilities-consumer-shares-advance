U.S. stocks fluctuated as gains in
utilities, consumer-staples companies and commodity producers
helped the market recover from an early slump triggered by
accelerating inflation and an increase in jobless claims.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose less than 0.1 percent
to 1,336.75 at 11:15 a.m. in  New York  after retreating as much
as 0.4 percent in the first 15 minutes of trading. The  Dow Jones
Industrial Average  climbed 2.35 points, or less than 0.1
percent, to 12,290.52, wiping out a 35-point drop.  The  S&P 500  jumped to the highest level since June 2008
yesterday as a more optimistic forecast for economic growth from
the  Federal Reserve , improving earnings and takeovers bolstered 
confidence in equities. The index rose as much as 98 percent from
a 12-year low in March 2009 amid government efforts to stimulate
the economy and higher-than-estimated profits.  Per-share earnings have topped analysts’ estimates at about
72 percent of the 387 companies in the S&P 500 that have
reported results since Jan. 10 and have grown 35 percent
collectively, Bloomberg data shows.  Earlier losses in stocks came after the consumer-price
index increased 0.4 percent for a second month, exceeding the
0.3 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News, figures from the Labor Department showed. The so-called
core rate, which excludes food and fuel costs, rose 0.2 percent,
the biggest gain since October 2009. First-time jobless claims
increased by 25,000 to 410,000 last week, a separate report
showed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
