  Russia ’s central bank annulled the
operating license of Rabobank Groep NV’s local unit, Bank Rossii
 said  on its website today.  Manel Vrijenhoek, a spokeswoman for Rabobank, said the
Dutch lender had requested for the license to be cancelled as it
wanted to concentrate on opportunities elsewhere in China, India
and U.S.  “We have changed our priorities and won’t be using our
subsidiary banking license in Russia” Vrijenhoek said by phone
from Utrecht, the Netherlands. “You have to make choices of how
to deploy resources and we see better opportunities in other
markets.”  Vrijenhoek said Rabobank retains a Moscow representative
office to serve Dutch clients active in Russia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
