  India , the second-biggest onion
grower, scrapped a ban on exports to prevent farmers from
distress sales after domestic prices dropped, a government
official said.  A panel led by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee allowed
shipments at a minimum price of $600 a metric ton, according to
the official, who didn’t want to be identified because the
government hasn’t made a formal announcement.  Prices of onion, a staple in the local cuisine, soared 70
percent in the week ended Jan. 1 according to the trade ministry
after excess rainfall damaged crops. The country halted exports
of the vegetable in the last week of December and ordered 1,000
tons from countries including neighbor Pakistan to cool prices.  The cost of the vegetable fell 27 percent in the week ended
Feb. 5, according to data released by trade ministry today.  India’s food inflation has stayed above 10 percent since
December, sparking opposition protests and prompting the central
bank to raise  interest rates  the most in Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
