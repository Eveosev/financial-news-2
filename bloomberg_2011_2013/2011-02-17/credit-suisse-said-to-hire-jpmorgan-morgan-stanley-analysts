  Credit Suisse Group AG  hired four
bank analysts and two equity salespeople from  JPMorgan Chase &
Co . in  London  as it rebuilds a team weakened by departures,
according to two people with knowledge of the moves.  Analysts Carla Antunes da Silva, Ignacio Cerezo Olmos, Amit Goel and Andrea Unzueta will join the bank, said the people, who
declined to be identified because the information is private.
Nick Gough and Justine Shih will join the team to sell European
financial stocks, the people said. None of the analysts could be
reached for comment on their office telephone numbers.  Separately, analyst Maxence Le Gouvello du Timat will join
the Zurich-based bank from Morgan Stanley, said Sebastian Howell, a London-based spokesman for the U.S. bank.  In November, Credit Suisse lost a team of five banking
analysts and two specialist salesmen, two people with knowledge
of the moves said at the time. Analysts Jonathan Pierce and
Daniel Davies both stayed at the bank. The lender came second in
Institutional Investorâ€™s 2010 poll for best European banking
coverage.  Sofia Rehman, a London-based spokeswoman for Credit Suisse,
and  Brian Marchiony , a spokesman for JPMorgan in London, both
declined to comment. Financial News reported the moves earlier.  Thibault Nardin will take over research coverage of French
and Belgian banks at  Morgan Stanley , Howell said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
