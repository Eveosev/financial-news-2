Telkom South Africa Ltd.,  Africa ’s
largest fixed-line phone company, said Lazarus Zim has been
appointed as chairman for one year and as a non-executive
director for three years.  Jeff Molobela, the former chairman, will remain on the
board as a non-executive director, the Pretoria-based company
that is almost 40 percent held by the South African government
said in a statement today.  Zim is the fourth person the government has appointed as
chairman since 2006. The government has also appointed one other
new non-executive director and reappointed two others under the
special Class A rights it holds, according to today’s statement.
The rights allow it to appoint four non-executive directors and
a chairman. The rights expire at the end of March.  Telkom’s acting Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Hedberg
leaves his post at the end of March. Telkom also has an acting
chief financial officer in Deon Fredericks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
