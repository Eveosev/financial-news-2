  Kenya ’s shilling weakened as
investors said banks sought to cover short positions, or wagers
an asset will retreat, and oil importers required dollars for
crude oil purchases.  The currency of the biggest East African economy lost as
much as 0.1 percent to 81.45 per dollar before trading at 81.40
to the dollar at 1:40 p.m. in Nairobi. The shilling closed at
81.35 yesterday.  “The shilling has weakened due to interbank trading as
commercial banks seek to cover their short position ahead of the
weekend and growing demand from the oil importers,” John Muli,
a dealer at Nairobi based African Banking Corp., said in a phone
interview today.  Growing demand for the currency from oil importers may push
the shilling to 81.60-81.70 per dollar, Muli said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
