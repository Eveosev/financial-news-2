About 29 percent of Shanghai people
say they received a pay increase in 2010, and 61 percent said
they expect a raise this year, the Shanghai Daily said, citing
the Shanghai Statistics Bureau.   Fewer than 10 percent of people were satisfied with their
salaries, with 33 percent "not content" and 34.4 percent "very
dissatisfied,’’ the English-language newspaper said today. The
bureau surveyed 2,531 people, the Daily said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
