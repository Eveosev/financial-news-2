Latvian Interior Minister Linda Murniece submitted her resignation to Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis.  Murniece plans to work through the end of the month, she
said in a statement on the Interior Ministry’s  website  today.
She didn’t give a reason for stepping down.  Latvian media including the news website  Apollo.lv  posted a
video showing two people dressed as policemen purportedly
stealing items from a car. Two unidentified people were detained
for questioning in relation to the video, said Sigita Pildava, a
police spokeswoman, according to the website.  Members of a special police unit three weeks ago allegedly
robbed a casino in the central Latvian city of Jekabpils in
which another policeman was shot dead.  Murniece, 41, is a member of Dombrovskis’ Unity bloc, the
biggest in parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
