  Tesoro Corp . had a  power outage  at
its Salt Lake City refinery, according to a Utah Department of
Environmental Quality report.  The refinery was attempting to restore power within 10
minutes after the incident occurred around 12:45 p.m. yesterday,
according to the report.  Mike Marcy, a Martinez, California-based Tesoro spokesman,
didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail sent before normal
business hours.  The incident led to the release of sulfur dioxide,
according to a filing to the National Response Center.  The refinery can process 60,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
