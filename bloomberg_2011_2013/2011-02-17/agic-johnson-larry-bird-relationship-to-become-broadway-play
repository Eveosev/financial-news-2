A play about the relationship
between  basketball Hall of Fame  members  Magic Johnson  and  Larry Bird  is being created for Broadway.  “Magic/Bird” is being developed by the producers and
writer of the current Broadway show “Lombardi,” and is
scheduled to debut in 2012, according to a news release.  The two National Basketball Association All-Stars, whose
rivalry eventually became a close relationship, battled each
other throughout their careers. Johnson’s Michigan State
University topped Bird’s Indiana State in the 1979 college
basketball championship game and the two met in the NBA Finals
three times in four years, with Bird’s Boston Celtics claiming
the championship in 1984 and Johnson’s Los Angeles Lakers taking
the title in 1985 and 1987.  Bird was inducted into the  Basketball Hall of Fame  in 1998,
four years before Johnson. Both played 13 seasons in the NBA,
with Johnson missing 1991-95 after disclosing that he had
contracted HIV. He returned for 32 games in 1996.  The play “chronicles the intertwined life stories” of the
two men, according to the release. It is being produced by Fran
Kirmser and Tony Ponturo and written by Eric Simonson, who held
the same roles in the making of “Lombardi.”  “Lombardi,” a one-act drama that opened in 2010 about the
life of Hall of Fame football coach Vince Lombardi, is the only
new play from the first half of the 2010-11 Broadway season
that’s still running.  With the  National Football League  also credited as a
“Lombardi” producer, it was staged with an investment of just
over $3 million. Ponturo and Kirmser met on the producing team
of the 2009 revival of the musical “Hair.” “Magic/Bird” is
being produced in association with the NBA as well as Johnson,
51, and Bird, 54.  To contact the reporter on this story:
