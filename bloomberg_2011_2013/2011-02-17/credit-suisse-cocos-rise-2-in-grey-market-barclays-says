  Credit Suisse Group AG ’s new
contingent convertible notes, or CoCos, rose about 2 percent in
“grey market” trading, according to Barclays Capital.  “The new Coco deal from Credit Suisse lifted sentiment
around bank capital, as market speculation about the book size
grew,” Barclays strategist Zoso Davies in London wrote in a
note to investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
