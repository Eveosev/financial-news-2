Japanese stocks rose, sending
benchmark indexes to their highest levels in almost nine months,
after the  Federal Reserve  raised its forecast for U.S. economic
growth and  oil prices  increased.  Canon Inc., a camera maker that gets about 80 percent of
its revenue abroad, climbed 3.9 percent. Honda Motor Co., which
gets 84 percent of its sales overseas, gained 1.1 percent. Inpex
Corp., Japan’s No. 1 oil explorer, jumped 3 percent. Resona
Holdings Inc. advanced 2.5 percent after the Asahi newspaper
said it will repay public funds.  “Expectations are increasing that the  U.S. economy  will
expand more strongly than previously forecast,” said Ikuo Mitsui, who helps manage $270 million at Vivace Capital
Management Co. “With strong fundamentals, it’s unlikely that
investors will shift to a sell-strategy for stocks.”  The Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 0.3 percent to
10,836.64 at the close in Tokyo. The broader Topix index gained
0.7 percent to 974.14, with more than twice as many stocks
advancing as falling. The Topix rose for a ninth day, the
longest winning streak since a 13-day run that ended Aug. 4,
2009. Both measures closed at their highest levels since April
30, 2010.  The Topix has gained 8.4 percent this year, the most among
the major Asia-Pacific indexes. That has driven the average
price of stocks in the gauge to 16.6 times estimated earnings,
the highest level since July.  ‘Improving Economic Sentiment’  “Economic sentiment is improving and that is supporting
the stock market,” said  Mitsushige Akino , who oversees about
$450 million in Tokyo at Ichiyoshi Investment Management Co.
“Investors expecting stocks to rise further are increasing”
because of positive economic data and strong corporate earnings.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.1 percent today.
The index rose 0.6 percent yesterday in  New York  to a 32-month
high after the Fed raised its forecast for economic growth and
earnings improved.  Officials “continued to express disappointment in both the
pace and the unevenness of the improvements in labor markets,”
while also judging the recovery to be on a “firmer footing,”
the  Federal Open Market Committee  said in minutes of its Jan.
25-26 meeting, released today in  Washington . Policy makers
raised projections for economic growth this year and made little
change to forecasts after 2011 or for unemployment and inflation.  U.S. Housing Starts  Commerce Department figures showed that housing starts
climbed 15 percent to a 596,000 annual rate. The median forecast
in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 539,000 rate. Work
started on 78 percent more dwellings with two or more units,
overshadowing a drop in single-family houses that indicates the
housing market continues to struggle.  “An improvement in the housing market and  consumer
spending  is a first step to a self-sustaining recovery,”
Ichiyoshi Investment Management’s Akino said.  Canon climbed 3.9 percent to 4,105 yen and was the biggest
support for the Topix and the Nikkei. Sony Corp., an electronics
maker that derives 70 percent of its sales abroad, rose 1.8
percent to 3,035 yen. Honda advanced 1.1 percent to 3,695 yen,
the highest since August 2008.  Honda may buy back 40 billion yen ($478 million) of its
shares, spokeswoman  Akemi Ando  said by phone from Tokyo today.
The Nikkei newspaper reported Honda’s plan to buy back shares
earlier today.  Oil Gains  Inpex jumped 3 percent to 579,000 yen. Japan Petroleum
Exploration Co., the nation’s second-biggest oil driller, rose
2.8 percent to 3,870 yen.  Inpex’s shares also gained after Nomura increased its price
estimate. The shares are cheap even after they rose on higher
oil prices, Nomura analyst Shigeki Matsumoto wrote in a
Japanese-language report dated yesterday. Matsumoto, who rates
the company “buy,” boosted a 12-month share price estimate to
740,000 yen from 640,000 yen.  Crude oil for March delivery rose 0.8 percent to settle at
$84.99 a barrel in New York yesterday.  Shipping lines rose as the Baltic Dry Index, a measure of
shipping costs for commodities, increased for an eighth straight
day yesterday. Nippon Yusen K.K., the country’s biggest shipping
line by sales, gained 1.3 percent to 383 yen. Mitsui O.S.K.
Lines Ltd., the second-biggest, advanced 1.4 percent to 582 yen.
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd., the No. 3, climbed 2.4 percent to
378 yen.  Resona Climbs  Resona Holdings gained 2.5 percent to 457 yen and was the
most-actively traded stock in Japan. The lender will repay 850
billion yen in public funds by buying back shares from the
Japanese government, the Asahi newspaper reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  “The cost Japan paid for the nation’s financial companies’
bad debts is finally repaid, and this means the balance sheet of
Japanese banks will be healthy,” Vivace Capital Management’s
Mitsui said.  Other financial companies also advanced. Sumitomo Mitsui
Financial Group Inc., Japan’s No. 2 bank by market value,
advanced 1 percent to 3,170 yen. Nomura Holdings Inc., Japan’s
largest brokerage, gained 1.1 percent to 552 yen. Tokio Marine
Holdings Inc., a casualty insurer, leapt 4.1 percent to 2,851
yen.  Of the 1,554 companies in the Topix Index that have
reported results since Jan. 1 for the latest quarter, 188 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 137 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
