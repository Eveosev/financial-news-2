  Barrick Gold Corp . and Visa Canada
Corp. are exploiting an exemption in ethics  legislation  to hire
former Harper administration aides as lobbyists, triggering
calls for increased regulation as Canadian lawmakers prepare to
review the rules.  Barrick, the world’s largest gold producer, and Visa
Canada, the subsidiary of the world’s largest bank-card network,
have hired former advisers to Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  and
Industry Minister Tony Clement as directors of government
affairs. They have done so even though a 2006 law sought to ban
politicians and ministerial staffers from lobbying for five
years after leaving office.  The companies are taking advantage of a provision that
exempts former policy makers who take jobs with corporations and
spend less than 20 percent of their time lobbying. The exemption
undermines the effectiveness of rules Prime Minister Stephen Harper has said were aimed at eliminating lobbying by  insiders ,
and should be removed, said Pat Martin, a lawmaker for the
opposition  New Democratic Party .  “It violates the spirit if not the letter of the law to be
lobbying on policy or legislation when you’ve just recently left
the ranks of government, and I don’t care if it’s for 20 percent
or 1 percent of your time,” Martin said in a telephone
interview. “There are inherent loopholes in the lobbyist
registration regime that you could drive a Mack truck through
and make a mockery of the intent.”  ‘Revolving Door’  Martin, who said he wants removal of the exemption to be
part of his party’s platform in the next election, raised the
issue in the House of Commons today, asking the Conservatives
what happened to their pledge to “clean up the revolving door
between their government and lobbying firms.” Treasury Board
President  Stockwell Day , the minister responsible for the law,
said lawmakers “can review the legislation at any time, adding
he intends to keep it “the best legislation among most western
democracies.”  The law is up for review by a parliamentary committee
before Parliament breaks for its summer session and the
government will review suggestions on how to improve the law,
Jay Denney, a spokesman for Day, said in an e-mailed statement.  Alanna Heath, a former  adviser  to Flaherty, was part of
Barrick’s efforts last year to defeat a bill requiring the
government to probe any alleged human-rights violations by
domestic mining companies outside Canada.  Government Relations  Heath worked for Flaherty from 2007 to 2009 before joining
Toronto-based Barrick as director of  government relations  early
last year. Heath isn’t  registered  as a lobbyist, according to
public records as of Feb. 16.  Heath deferred questions about her actions to Barrick
spokesman Andy Lloyd, who confirmed in an e-mailed statement
that Heath met with lawmakers. Lloyd said the meetings were
allowed because of the exemption in the law, and that all
meetings were disclosed to the  office  of Commissioner of
Lobbying Karen E. Shepherd.  Rodney MacDonald, a former adviser to Clement, signed on
last year as director of government relations for Toronto-based
 Visa Canada . In a telephone interview Jan. 6, MacDonald said he
has lobbied lawmakers legally because he doesn’t spend more than
20 percent of his time lobbying. He was listed as an active
lobbyist in a Feb. 2 filing by Visa on the commissioner’s
website.  MacDonald said he voluntarily tells the lobbying commission
who he is meeting in order to “safeguard” himself from
“hearsay” about what he is doing.  First Legislation  The  Federal Accountability Act  was the first piece of
legislation introduced after Harper took office in 2006. In
addition to the lobbying restrictions, it ended political
donations by companies, required public servants to record all
contacts with lobbyists and eliminated contingency fees in the
lobbying industry.  The  law , which Harper says was aimed at removing the
influence of insiders,  prohibits  former government employees who
held senior positions from communicating with designated
“public office holders” on behalf of companies for five years.  It exempts from that provision former officials for whom
lobbying doesn’t constitute a significant part of their work. In
July 2009, Shepherd ruled that “significant” means “20
percent or more of overall duties.”  The exemption isn’t available to former officials who work
for lobbyist consulting firms.  No Lobbying Ban  “There is no five-year ban on lobbying; there is a five-
year ban on doing a significant amount of it,” said Duff Conacher, head of Ottawa-based Democracy Watch, an advocacy
group for government accountability.  Individuals can also apply for an  exemption  from any
lobbying restrictions if they held office for a short period of
time or had administrative duties only. The exemptions are
posted on the commissioner’s website.  Former senior government employees are also constrained by
 conflict  of interest regulations in the law that prohibit them
from taking “improper advantage” of their public office,
giving advice to employers using confidential information or
communicating for one year with any public official with whom
they had “significant official dealings” while in office.  Visa’s MacDonald said that means he doesn’t meet with any
officials from a “swath of ministries,” though there aren’t
any specific guidelines from the ethics commissioner on whom he
could meet.  ‘Honor System’  “It is kind of an honor system,” MacDonald said. “I
really wish it wasn’t. The onus is on me not to meet with people
that would be against those rules. So I have self-determined
that just as a safeguard I’m not meeting with any ministers’
offices because I worked with all the ministers’ offices.”  Barrick’s Heath met or spoke to lawmakers on at least four
occasions in October, according to Members of Parliament who
witnessed her doing so, as part of efforts by companies such as
Barrick,  Goldcorp Inc ., and  IAMGOLD Corp . to defeat a bill aimed
at cracking down on alleged human-rights violations by Canadian
mining companies.  Liberal lawmaker Wayne Easter said he met Heath in his
office on Oct. 20. Liberal lawmaker Martha Hall-Findlay said
Heath took part in a meeting with lawmakers from her party
shortly before the bill was  defeated  by a 140-134 margin in an
Oct. 27 vote. Heath also spoke to Liberal lawmaker Marc Garneau
in Garneau’s office on Oct. 18, according to Roch Gamache, a
Garneau aide.  Shares Decline  Shares of Barrick have lost 3.6 percent over the past three
months and returned 26.8 percent over the past year. The
company’s 10 closest gold mining peers by market value have
averaged a 6 percent decline over the past three months, and a
14.5 percent gain over the past 12 months.  Shares of San Francisco-based  Visa Inc . have lost 10.2
percent over the past year, compared with a 13.9 percent gain
for MasterCard Inc. and a 22.4 percent gain for American Express
Co.  Natalie Hall, a spokeswoman for Shepherd, said that the
office doesn’t comment on specific lobbyists or cases. Jocelyne
Brisebois, a spokeswoman with the country’s ethics commissioner
who oversees this aspect of the Federal Accountability Act, also
declined to comment on specific cases.  Harper’s office deferred questions about the act to Day,
the Treasury Board president.  The exemption was intended to ensure that former public
officials who have “one meeting a year” with a lawmaker aren’t
hurt by a “whopping regulatory overhead,” according to Charles
King, president of the  Government Relations Institute  of  Canada ,
an Ottawa-based association that represents the lobbying
industry.  King said in a Jan. 24 interview he was concerned that use
of the exemption may “wind up giving everyone who follows the
rules a black eye, and wind up strengthening the case for
tougher rules for everyone” who attempts to sway lawmakers.  “Lobbying is lobbying is lobbying,” King said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
