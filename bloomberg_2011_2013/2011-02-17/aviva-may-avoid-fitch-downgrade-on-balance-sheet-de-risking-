  Aviva Plc , the U.K.’s second-largest
insurer, may avoid a downgrade from Fitch Ratings after limiting
the risk of investment losses.  The outlook on the London-based insurer was lifted to
“stable” from “negative” on the “recovery in Aviva’s
capital position, driven by financial markets and balance sheet
de-risking,” the ratings firm said in a statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
