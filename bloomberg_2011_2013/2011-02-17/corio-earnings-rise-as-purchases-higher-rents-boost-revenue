  Corio NV , the largest Dutch real-
estate company, said earnings excluding items rose 12 percent in
the fourth quarter as acquisitions and higher rents boosted
revenue.  Earnings excluding changes in asset values and deferred
tax, known as the direct result, increased to 62.9 million euros
($85 million), or 69 cents a share, the Utrecht-based company
said in an e-mailed statement today. A year earlier, earnings
totaled 56 million euros, or 73 cents a share.  “The direct result is expected to show further growth” in
2011, the company said in the statement. On a per-share basis
the gain will be “fractional” because of last year’s 600
million-euro rights offering and the 2010 dividend payment in
stock, it said.  Chief Executive Officer Gerard Groener acquired 1.25
billion euros of malls last year as he focused Corio on large
shopping centers, where retail sales have been stronger than the
national average in the six countries where it owns property.
The purchases, such as  Italy ’s largest mall and centers in
Dresden and Duisburg in  Germany , added 54.4 million euros to
revenue last year.  Corio will pay a dividend of 2.69 euros a share in cash or
stock, up from 2.65 euros a year earlier.  Net rental income rose 20 percent to 103.3 million euros in
the fourth quarter. The company’s properties appreciated by 90.2
million euros, lifting net income to 139.7 million euros, or
1.53 euros a share, from 19.9 million euros, or 26 cents, a year
earlier.  Net asset value fell 1 percent from the third quarter to
46.79 euros a share. Corio raised about 236 million euros from
disposals.  The earnings were released after the close of regular
trading in Amsterdam. Corio rose 5.5 cents to 49.04 euros,
lifting the company’s market value to 4.46 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
