Corn fell in  South Africa , the
largest producer of the grain on the continent, as a
strengthening rand curbed the cost of imports for local millers.  The rand traded at 7.2319 to the dollar at the 12 p.m.
close in Johannesburg, compared with 7.2963 at the close of
grain trading at noon yesterday.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, dropped 5 rand, or 0.3
percent, to 1,654 rand ($229) a metric ton. Meal made from the
grain is the countryâ€™s staple food.  Yellow corn for July delivery fell 18 rand, or 1.1 percent,
to 1,681 rand a ton. The grain is used mainly as  animal feed  in
South Africa.  Wheat for March delivery declined 59 rand, or 1.8 percent,
to 3,296 rand a ton.  Gains or losses for the most active contracts of three
additional crops today were as follows. All prices are in rand
and the crops are sold per ton:  To contact the reporter on this story:
