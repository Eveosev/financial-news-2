The U.S. Treasury Department today
said It would freeze the assets of Bank Refah for supporting  Iran ’s ballistic missiles and the country’s Revolutionary Guard
Corps.  Many of Iran’s banks have been involved in transactions
that help strengthen Iran’s military, the Treasury Department
said in a press release.  “The pervasiveness of this illicit conduct explains why
legitimate financial institutions everywhere are deciding to
shun Iranian banks,” said Under Secretary for Terrorism and
Financial Intelligence Stuart Levey in a statement.  Bank Refah provided services to the Iranian Ministry of
Defense and Armed Forces Logistics and the Iran Aircraft
Manufacturing Industrial Company, according to the Treasury
Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
