  Taiwan ’s government bonds were
little changed before an auction of NT$30 billion ($1.1 billion)
of 30-year notes today.  The debt will yield around 2.15 percent, compared with
2.203 percent at the previous sale in December, according to
James Wang, a bond trader at Yuanta Securities Co. in Taipei.
Taiwan’s dollar gained following late intervention by the
central bank yesterday.  “Demand from insurers will be strong as it’s a long-dated
bond,” said Wang. “Yield won’t move much until we get the
result of the auction.”  The yield on the 1 percent security due January 2016, the
most-traded debt, was 1.124 percent compared with 1.125 percent
yesterday, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The government is due to report gross domestic product data
for the fourth quarter today. Growth slowed to 6.4 percent from
9.8 percent in the prior three months, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 0.4 percent to NT$29.356 against
its U.S. counterpart as of 10:11 a.m. local time, according to
Taipei Forex Inc.  The currency was 0.1 percent stronger two minutes before
yesterday’s close and ended unchanged after the central bank
stepped in during the last minutes of trading, according to two
traders who declined to be identified as the monetary authority
doesn’t usually disclose such details.  “Volume is thin today,” said Tarsicio Tong, a Taipei-
based currency trader at Union Bank of Taiwan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
