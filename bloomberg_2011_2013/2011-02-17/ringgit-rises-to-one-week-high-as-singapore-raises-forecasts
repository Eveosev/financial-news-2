Malaysia’s ringgit strengthened as  Singapore , its largest export market, raised forecasts for
overseas shipments and inflation in 2011. Bonds gained.  The currency touched a one-week high after the city-state’s
trade ministry said today there was “some upside potential” to
Singapore’s economic growth forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent
for this year.  Asia ’s policy makers will likely allow more
currency appreciation to help temper the higher cost of imported
goods, said Nik M. Khairul, a treasury dealer at Asian Finance
Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. Consumer prices in Malaysia increased
2.2 percent in December, the fastest pace in 19 months.  “Better exports and inflation pressure are building up
market expectations for higher  interest rates  or stronger
currencies,” Nik said. “This means hot money will continue to
search for higher returns in this region.”  The ringgit advanced 0.1 percent to 3.0435 per dollar as of
4:22 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 3.0290 on Feb. 4, the strongest level
since October 1997.  Singapore’s trade ministry said exports may increase by as
much as 10 percent this year, versus a previous top estimate of
8 percent. It also said inflation may accelerate 3 percent to 4
percent in 2011, up from a previous forecast of 2 percent to 3
percent.  European  consumer confidence  rose in February and an index
of U.S. leading indicators gained in January for a third month,
according to Bloomberg surveys ahead of the data due today,
adding to signs the global recovery is strengthening.  Bond Sales  Benchmark seven-year notes gained on speculation the
government will sell fewer bonds after it raised 3 billion
ringgit this week from the sale of seven-and 10-year Shariah-
compliant notes.  The yield on 4.012 percent bond due September 2017 fell 2
basis points, or 0.02 percentage points, to 3.72 percent,
according to Bursa  Malaysia . The price rose 0.15, or 1.5 ringgit
per 1,000 ringgit face amount, to 101.7.  The treasury is scheduled to auction Islamic bonds maturing
in August 2018 later this month, according to its sale calendar.
It sold 4.5 billion ringgit of 2014 notes on Feb. 11 in the
single-largest offering since October 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
