Investors withdrew about $974
million from U.S. municipal-bond mutual funds this week, the
14th-straight period of withdrawals, Lipper US Fund Flows said
yesterday.  The redemptions were the least that investors made since
the week ended Dec. 8. Outflows have totaled $25.8 billion since
mid-November, according to  Lipper , a Denver-based research
company.  “We see it headed in the right direction,” said Matt Dalton, chief executive officer of Belle Haven Investments Inc.
in  White Plains , New York, who oversees about $600 million in
municipal assets. “The fact that you’re seeing it dwindle is a
good sign.”  Typically, the beginning of the year is when investors
reallocate assets that matured from the previous year, Dalton
said.  Investors pulled $4 billion in the week ended Jan. 19, the
most since Lipper started compiling data in 1992.  Some investors exited the $2.86 trillion municipal  debt
market  amid a prediction of defaults amounting to “hundreds of
billions of dollars” by  Meredith Whitney , an analyst who
correctly projected Citigroup Inc.’s dividend cut two years ago.  In the wake of the national recession, 44 states face a
combined $125 billion of budget deficits next fiscal year,
according to a study by the Washington-based Center on Budget &
Policy Priorities, a nonprofit group focused on issues affecting
lower-income Americans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
