Loan prices of  Virgin Media Inc .,
the U.K.’s second-largest pay-television company, rose after  Fitch Ratings  upgraded the company’s debt, citing a strong
business model and “significant” reductions in net borrowings.  Loans of Hook, England-based Virgin Media rose 25 basis
points to a mid-price of 100.5 percent of face value, according
to prices from Mizuho Financial Group UFJ Ltd.  Fitch today increased Virgin Media’s long-term issuer
default rating by one level to BB+, after the company said
earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
climbed to 403.6 million pounds ($650 million) from 367.1
million pounds a year earlier. The upgrade comes after
Virgin Media said yesterday senior lenders amended its 1.93
billion-pound credit facility to allow borrowing to pay
dividends and reduce debt limits to three times Ebitda.  Virgin Media’s improving operating and financial
performance “point to greater upside than Fitch’s forecasts
originally anticipated”, said Damien Chew, a senior director in
Fitch’s media team in  London  in a statement today.  “Continued financial discipline is evident from the
amendments to the company’s bank facility, which has lowered the
net total leverage covenant to 3.75 times from 4.3 times at the
end of 2011,” said Chew.  Virgin Media is rated Ba2 by Moody’s Investors Service, BB-
by Standard & Poor’s and BB by Fitch Ratings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
