The rand advanced to its strongest
in more than a week as commodity prices rose and analysts said
the yield advantage of South African assets attracted investors.  The South African currency appreciated as much as 0.7
percent to 7.1992 per dollar, the strongest intraday level since
Feb. 9, and traded at 7.2415 by 4:59 p.m. in Johannesburg, from
a close of 7.2472 in  London  late yesterday. Against the euro the
rand slumped 0.2 percent to 9.8446.  Gold increased for a fourth day as concern global
inflationary pressures are rising stoked demand for precious
metals as a hedge against inflation. Bullion, along with
platinum, accounts for about a fifth of  South Africa ’s export
revenue.  “In the short term, higher commodity prices are supporting
the current bout of strength in the rand,” Trevor Barsdorf, an
analyst at  Econometrix Treasury Management , a bond and foreign-
exchange advisory in Johannesburg, said by telephone. “Interest
rate-differentials remain an attractive long-term play.”  The currency of Africa’s biggest economy surged 42 percent
in the two years through 2010 as higher yields in emerging
markets attracted money from developed countries trying to dig
themselves out of recession by cutting  interest rates  to almost
zero. Central bank rates of 0.1 percent in Japan and 0.25
percent in the U.S. compare with a benchmark borrowing level of
5.5 percent in South  Africa , even after nine reductions since
December 2008.  “Despite South African interest rates being at 30-year
lows, they are still comparatively high,”  Michael Keenan , a
Johannesburg-based currency strategist at Standard Bank Group
Ltd., Africa’s biggest lender, wrote in a client note today.  South African  government bonds  rose for a fifth day, with
the 13.5 percent security due September 2015 climbing 16 cents
to 121.88 rand. The yield on the bond lost 4 basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 7.72 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
