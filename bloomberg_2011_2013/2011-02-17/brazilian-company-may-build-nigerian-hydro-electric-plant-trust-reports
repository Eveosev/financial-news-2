  Nigeria  is to start talks with a
Brazilian company over the construction of a hydroelectric plant
in the northeastern Adamawa state,  Daily Trust  reported, without
naming the company.  The Mambilla Dam Power Project, estimated to cost about $4
billion, will generate 2,600 megawatts of electricity when
completed in 2018, the Abuja-based newspaper cited Nuhu Wya,
minister of state for power, as saying.  The West African country yesterday awarded a $37 million
contract for the design and supervision of the project, the
Daily Trust reported, without giving details.  Power cuts occur daily in Nigeria, where demand for
electricity is almost double the current supply of more than
3,000 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
