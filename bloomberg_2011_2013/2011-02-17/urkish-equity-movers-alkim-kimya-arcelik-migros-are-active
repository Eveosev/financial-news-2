Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index  rose for a third straight day, gaining 611.38, or 0.9
percent, to a one-month high of 65,973.16 at the 5:30 p.m. close
of trading in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in

sulfate, jumped the most in almost two months, rising 22 kurus,
or 2.9 percent, to 7.84 liras. The company will complete its
fourth plant by June and increase its annual capacity to 450,000
tons from 330,000 tons, making it the world’s fifth biggest
producer of sodium sulfate, it said.    Arcelik AS  (ARCLK TI), Turkey’s biggest maker of fridges
and washing machines, dropped after reporting profit that missed

company signed an agreement to sell its Ramstore MMC unit in
Azerbaijan for $14.3 million to Dubai-based Intersun Holding
FZCO, it said in a statement to the exchange today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
