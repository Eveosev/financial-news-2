Slovakia wants to sell its spare
United Nations carbon-dioxide credits through an auction by
April, Environment Minister Jozsef Nagy said.
　　The country has 27 million tons of so-called Assigned Amount
Units, or AAUs, available for sale this year, Nagy said at a
press conference in Bratislava. The ministry expects to raise
between 4 euros and 6.5 euros ($5.40 to $8.80) per ton, in line
with similar transactions in neighboring countries, he said.
　　Should demand in the auction be lower than the amount
available, the ministry will hire intermediaries to facilitate
additional sales, Nagy added.
　　The AAUs were allotted to nations in eastern  Europe  after
the economic collapse during their transition from communism to
market economies early in the 1990s. Proceeds from sales are
supposed to be spent on energy-efficiency improvement projects.  To contact the reporter on this story: Radoslav Tomek in
