Technip SA,  Europe ’s second-largest
oilfield-services provider, swung to a profit in the fourth
quarter and said demand for offshore, natural gas and refining
projects is improving as the oil price rallies.  Net income was 112.2 million euros ($152.3 million) from a
loss of 152.6 million euros a year earlier, the company said in
a statement. Sales gained 22 percent to 1.77 billion euros.  The company is targeting group revenue of between 6.5
billion and 6.7 billion euros in 2011, a subsea operating margin
of above 15 percent and an onshore/offshore margin of between 6
percent and 6.5 percent.  Technip, whose largest competitor in Europe is  Italy ’s
Saipem SpA, was counting on  oil companies  making final
investment decisions on projects at a faster pace last year as
global demand for crude recovered. Oil service providers
suffered in 2009 after clients cut investments because of
tighter credit markets and a drop in crude prices from their
2008 highs.  Technip had an order backlog of 9.23 billion euros at the
end of the December, compared with 8.5 billion euros at the end
of the third quarter.  The company’s subsea operating margin was 16.2 percent in
the fourth quarter compared with 18.1 percent a year earlier
while the combined onshore/offshore margin was 5.9 percent
compared with 6.6 percent a year earlier.  The French oil services company last month announced a plan
to increase pipe manufacturing in  Brazil , where development of
offshore reserves is set to expand. Technip was also
chosen as part of a group to build a second refinery in  Vietnam .  Technip last month also bought all the assets of Subocean
Group Ltd., a Scottish supplier of cables for offshore wind
farms that delayed its debt payments in the Edinburgh courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
