INA Industrija Nafte d.d.,  Croatia ’s
only refiner, plans maintenance halts at its two plants later
this year after starting production from new units this month.  The Rijeka refinery will have a partial shutdown for about
30 days in the autumn, the Zagreb-based refiner controlled by
Hungary’s Mol Nyrt. said today in a statement. The company said
in November it would halt fuel-producing units at the 90,000
barrel-a-day plant at the start of the second quarter.  New units started operations on Feb. 12 at the Rijeka
facility, INA said in a statement earlier this week. A mild
hydrocracker, hydrogen plant and desulfurization unit were
installed at a cost of 400 million euros ($542 million).
Hydrocrackers are involved in the production of distillates, a
group of fuels including diesel and gasoil.  A bigger shutdown is planned at the Rijeka plant in spring
2013, INA said today. The refiner also plans to idle its 44,000
barrel-a-day Sisak refinery near the capital Zagreb in the
autumn for 40 to 45 days of work, it said. Both facilities used
Azeri Light crude oil in 2010, it said in a Feb. 15 earnings
statement.  Mol has a 47.26 percent share in INA and the Croatian
government owns 44.84 percent, according to the company’s
 website . The rest is held by institutional and private
investors.  To contact the reporters on this story:
