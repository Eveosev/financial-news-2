Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
fell in January by 140 million euros ($189.7 million) to 9.861
billion euros, mainly due to “currency movements,” the
Belgrade-based National Bank of  Serbia  said.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and cash Serbia drew from the  International Monetary Fund  under a 3-billion-euro bailout loan,
fell to 4.92 billion euros from 5.07 billion in December, the
bank said in an e-mailed statement today.  Banks held 1.27 billion euros in foreign-exchange reserves
at the end of the month.  The central bank said it spent 42.1 million euros in
January to service external debts.  End-of-January reserves were equivalent to 458 percent of
M1 money supply and covered more than seven months of imports.  Interbank trading volumes fell in January to 1.1 billion
euros from 2.4 billion euros in December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
