Lazard International Chief Executive
Officer Naguib Kheraj is leaving less than two months after
joining the firm.  Kheraj, 46, who joined  Lazard Ltd .’s international unit on
Jan. 1, now intends to concentrate on philanthropic activities
with the Aga Khan Development Network and other personal
interests, Lazard said in an e-mailed statement today. Kheraj
will also step down as deputy chairman of the firm, the company
said.  “I am very sad to be leaving Lazard, and have not taken
this decision lightly,” said Kheraj in the statement. “I
underestimated the difficulty of managing my external activities
in a way that would enable me to be properly engaged in an
executive role.”  Before joining Lazard, Kheraj was CEO of JPMorgan Cazenove
and a senior adviser at the Financial Services Authority, the
U.K. regulator. He worked at  Barclays Plc  for a decade and
served as head of  investment banking  and private equity at
Barclays Capital before becoming finance director of the bank in
2004. He stepped down in 2007. Before Barclays, he worked at
Salomon Brothers in  London  and was co-head of global capital
markets at Robert Fleming & Co. The story was earlier reported
