Coffee farmers may need two or three
years to boost production, according to Ted Lingle, co-founder
of the Coffee Quality Institute in  Long Beach , California.  The increase will lead to lower prices, Lingle said in an
interview at a coffee conference today in Arusha in northern
Tanzania. Arabica coffee prices have jumped 8.8 percent this
year because of crop damage in producing countries such as
Colombia.  Prices will be supported this year with producer stockpiles
at a record low of 13 million bags, Jose Sette, executive
director of the  International Coffee Organization , said.  “Until the end of this year the supply situation will
remain tight and I don’t see much space for prices to go down
significantly,” Sette said.  Producer stockpiles dropped after Colombia’s crop declined
to 8 million bags, Sette said. Production was 12.5 million bags
in 2007-08, according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . A
bag of coffee weighs 132 pounds (60 kilograms).  To contact the reporter on this story:
