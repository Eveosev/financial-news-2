Tanzania,  Africa ’s fourth-largest
coffee producer, aims to increase production of the beans to
80,000 metric tons a year by 2016, according to the state-run
 Tanzania Coffee Research Institute .  The African nation is accelerating its replanting program
to achieve the output target, Jeremiah Magera, a program manager
at the institute, said in an interview yesterday in Arusha, in
northern Tanzania. The country aims to plant 16 million coffee
trees, most of them of the arabica variety, in the 12 months
through June, up from 13.7 million trees last year, he said.  “We are pursuing a strategy that will boost production to
80,000 tons by 2016 and then to 120,000 tons by 2020,” he said.    Tanzania  started a coffee replanting program in 2005 and
has since planted 32 million seedlings, Magera said. Most of the
trees planted are of improved arabica varieties, he said.  The East African country will boost distribution of robusta
trees “significantly” during the next five years after
developing four varieties which are resistant to coffee wilt
disease, a fungus that prevents water and nutrients from
traveling from the roots to other parts of the coffee plant,
causing wilting and eventually death.  “We want to develop an aggressive planting system for
robusta like we are doing for arabica,” Damian Mtega, a senior
scientist at TACRI, as the institute is known, said in a
separate interview. “The disease has wiped out the crop in some
robusta growing villages,” he said, without commenting further.  Robusta, which currently accounts for about 30 percent of
Tanzania’s annual production, is grown in the northwestern
region of Kagera which borders  Uganda .  Tanzania is Africa’s largest coffee producer after  Ethiopia , Uganda and the  Ivory Coast .  To contact the reporter on this story:
