Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index  climbed 17.60 points, or 0.5
percent, to 3,434.38, gaining for a fourth day.  PT Astra International (ASII IJ),  Indonesia ’s biggest
automotive retailer, advanced 3.5 percent to 51,000 rupiah, its
sharpest increase since Jan. 25. The nation’s January domestic
vehicle sales rose to 73,849 units from 70,061 units in December
and 52,831 units a year earlier, Astra said, citing data from
the Indonesian automotive industries association.  PT Kimia Farma (KAEF IJ), a state-owned pharmaceutical
company, jumped 12 percent to 149 rupiah, its steepest advance
since April 2009. Kimia Farma plans to sell new shares in a
rights offer next year to boost public ownership in the company,
President Director Muhammad Sjamsul Arifin said.  PT Pembangunan Perumahan (PTPP IJ), a state-owned
construction company, advanced 5.2 percent to 610 rupiah, the
biggest gain since Jan. 12. Pembangunan plans to spin off its
property division into a separate company this year and may sell
a 30 percent to 40 percent stake in the unit in an initial
public offering,  Bisnis Indonesia  reported, citing Musyanif,
president director at the company. Musyanif couldn’t be reached
when called at his office in Jakarta.  PT Timah (TINS IJ), Indonesia’s largest tin producer, fell
1.7 percent to 2,825 rupiah. Tin output from Indonesia, the
world’s largest exporter, may drop for a second year as flooding
caused by a La Nina weather event cuts the supply of ore,
according to an industry executive from the top-producing
region.  Refined-tin output may total 60,000 to 70,000 metric tons
this year, Johan Murod, a director at PT Bangka Belitung Timah
Sejahtera, a group of eight smelters, said in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
