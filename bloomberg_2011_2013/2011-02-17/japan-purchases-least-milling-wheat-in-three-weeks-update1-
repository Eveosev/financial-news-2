Japan bought 153,858 metric tons of
milling wheat from the U.S. and  Canada  in a regular tender today,
the smallest volume in three weeks, after futures in Chicago
jumped to the highest level since 2008.  Shipment is set from April 1 to April 30, said Masafumi Otsuka at the grain-trade division of the Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries.  The ministry, which controls overseas purchases and
domestic sales of wheat to stabilize supply, is  Asia ’s largest
buyer as a single entity. It has bought 4.76 million tons this
fiscal year through regular tenders, surpassing the 4.26 million
tons purchased in the year ended March 31, 2010.  Wheat futures for May delivery gained 0.6 percent to $8.75
a bushel at 4:09 p.m. Tokyo time on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The price reached $9.1675 on Feb. 14, the highest level since
August 2008, after drought slashed Russian output and floods
damaged crops in Australia and Canada.  Details of this week’s tender are listed below:  To contact the reporter on this story:
