Ghana’s currency, the cedi,
strengthened against the  U.S. dollar  as foreign investors who
purchased  government bonds  at an auction yesterday sold the
greenback to settle their transactions in local currency.  The cedi traded at 1.5055 as of 1:37 p.m. in Accra, from
1.5095 at 9 a.m. this morning, according to data from  Barclays
Bank of Ghana Ltd.   “Those who won the bids are selling dollars to get cedis
to settle,” said Jacob Brobbey, a currency trader with the
lender, in an interview in Accra today.  The Bank of Ghana sold 401.2 million cedis ($268 million)
of three-year bonds yesterday with an average yield of 13.45
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
