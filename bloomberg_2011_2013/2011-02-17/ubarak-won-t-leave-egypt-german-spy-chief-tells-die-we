  Germany ’s BND federal intelligence
agency has no evidence that former Egyptian President  Hosni Mubarak  wants to leave the country, Die Welt cited Ernst Uhrlau,
the service’s head, as saying in an interview.  Mubarak’s comment that he wants to stay and be buried in
Egypt is credible, the  newspaper  quotedUhrlau as saying in an
e-mailed copy of an article for tomorrow’s edition.  The BND was surprised by how quickly Tunisia’s regime
collapsed once former President Zine el Abidine Ben Ali made
initial concessions to anti-government protesters, Uhrlau told
the Berlin-based newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
