  BASF SE , the world’s largest
chemicals maker, said it completed testing a technology to
reduce the cost of removing carbon dioxide from natural gas in
collaboration with Japan’s  JGC Corp . and Inpex Corp.  The gear lowers the cost of extracting and compressing the
waste gas by as much as 35 percent, the companies said today in
a  statement  on BASF’s website.  The technique, jointly developed by Ludwigshafen, Germany-
based BASF and industrial plant developer JGC, was tested at
Inpex’s Koshijihara natural gas plant in Nagaoka, northern
Japan. It works by absorbing the CO2 in a solvent that is more
efficient and stable than existing products, making the gas able
to withstand higher compression, the statement said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
