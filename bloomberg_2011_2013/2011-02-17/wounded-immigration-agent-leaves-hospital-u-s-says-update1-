A U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement agent who was shot while working in  Mexico  was
discharged from a hospital yesterday, federal officials said.  The agent, Victor Avila Jr., is home recovering from his
wounds, according to a statement today by the immigration
agency.  White House press secretary Jay Carney said yesterday that
the administration is forming a  task force  to investigate the
shootings of Avila and ICE special agent Jaime Zapata, who died
from his wounds. The agents were shot on Feb. 15 in the line of
duty in San Luis Potosi state by unknown assailants as they
drove on a federal highway between Mexico City and Monterrey,
according to ICE.  The agents appeared to be ambushed while driving a sports-
utility vehicle on a routine business trip yesterday, said a
U.S. official who asked to remain anonymous because the
investigation isn’t complete.  The Zetas drug cartel has claimed responsibility, although
the group’s involvement hasn’t been confirmed, the official
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
