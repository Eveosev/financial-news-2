Investec Ltd. submitted an
application to the Cape Town High Court to liquidate Pinnacle
Point Group Ltd., Fin24 said, citing Investec group risk manager
Ciaran Whelan.  Pinnacle Point, a developer of golf estates, owes Investec
85 million rand, the Johannesburg-based Internet news service
said. The application only affects Pinnacle Point Estates, a
unit of the company, Fin24 said, citing Steven Kruger, Pinnacle
Point’s acting chief executive officer.  Pinnacle Point may sell a golf estate, which will help
cover the debt, Kruger was cited as saying. Investec’s
application will be heard on Feb. 23, Fin24 said.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
