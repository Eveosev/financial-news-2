The pound may extend gains to $1.63
if it breaks out of a so-called short-term bearish channel,
Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd. said, citing trading patterns.  Intra-day moves suggested the  currency pair  is “trying to
break out of its little flag formation,” wrote Mizuho’s senior
analyst Nicole Elliott. “All aspects of this chart suggest a
long position.”  On a chart, a bear flag formation occurs when a currency
declines or its appreciation pauses. It is so named for the
graph’s resemblance to an inverted flag on a pole.  Investors should add the pound to their long positions, or
bets the currency will rise, if it retreats to $1.60, and exit
the trade to prevent further losses if it falls below $1.5950,
Elliott wrote in an e-mailed note today.  The pound has gained 3 percent so far this year, according
to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a measure of
10 developed-nation currencies. Sterling, which declined 0.2
percent in the past week, traded at $1.6154 as of 2:29 p.m. in  London , from $1.6154 yesterday.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
