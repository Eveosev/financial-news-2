President  Thomas Hoenig  said the  U.S. economy  is improving
“systematically” and inflation has started to slowly rise.  “The economy is improving systematically now and I think
on a sustainable basis,” Hoenig said according to the
transcript of an interview today on Fox Business Network.
“There is indications that inflation is rising slowly,
modestly, but still rising,” he said.  Hoenig spoke after a Labor Department report this morning
showed that rising food and fuel prices pushed up the U.S. cost
of living more than forecast in January. The consumer-price
index advanced 0.4 percent for a second month, led by the
biggest increase in food costs in more than two years, according
to figures today.  “One month’s data is one month’s data,” Hoenig said. “It
doesn’t tell you if you have an inflation problem.”  “The issue with inflation is that it always is very small
increases,” he said. “It starts slowly, perhaps as we’re
seeing now, and builds over time.”  Fed presidents rotate voting on monetary policy and Hoenig,
64, will not vote this year. He joined the Kansas City Fed in
1973 as an economist in banking supervision, after earning his
doctorate at  Iowa State University . Hoenig became president of
the Kansas City Fed in 1991.  To contact the reporters on this story:
