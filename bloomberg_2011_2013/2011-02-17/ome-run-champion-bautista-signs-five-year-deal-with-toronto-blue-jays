Jose Bautista, who led  Major League
Baseball  with 54 home runs in 2010, has signed a five-year, $64
million contract with the  Toronto Blue Jays .  Bautista, 30, also led the majors with 92 extra-base hits
last season and earned his first All-Star selection. The
contract, which pays the outfielder $8 million next season and
$14 million in each of the following four years, includes a club
option for 2016, the team said today in a news release.  Last season, Bautista became the fourth player in baseball
history to record at least 35 doubles, 50 home runs and 100
walks in a season. His club-record 54 home runs were more than
triple his previous career high of 16, set in 2006 with the
Pittsburgh Pirates.  The contract allows Bautista and the  Blue Jays  to avoid
arbitration. Bautista, who made $2.4 million last season, was
seeking $10.5 million through arbitration and the team
originally countered with a $7.6 million offer, according to the
 Toronto Star .  To contact the reporter on this story:
