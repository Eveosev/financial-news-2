OAO AvtoVAZ,  Russia â€™s largest
automaker, will buy most of its steel from OAO Novolipetsk
Steel, or NLMK, instead of OAO Severstal, Vedomosti reported,
citing two unidentified people familiar with the matter.   AvtoVAZ decided to cut purchases from Severstal over a
price dispute, the Moscow-based newspaper said today.     To contact the reporter on this story:
