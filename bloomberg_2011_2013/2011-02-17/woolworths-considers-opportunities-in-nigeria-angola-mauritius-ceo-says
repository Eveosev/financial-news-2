Woolworths Holdings Ltd. is
considering opportunities in Nigeria, Mauritius and Angola and
expects its businesses in Africa outside  South Africa  to make a
bigger contribution in 10 years, Ian Moir, the companyâ€™s chief
executive officer, said in a phone interview today.  The company is commited to its Country Road business in
Australia, he said.  Consumers in South Africa are less indebted than they were
and are buying more as lower inflation and  interest rates  boost
sales, he said. The company expects its prices to rise by an
average of 8 percent over the next year.  Woolworths will make it easier for customers to get credit,
he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
