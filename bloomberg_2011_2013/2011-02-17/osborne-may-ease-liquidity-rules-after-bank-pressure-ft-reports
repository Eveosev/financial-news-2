U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  is considering ways of easing bank liquidity
rules following increased pressure for a looser regime from the
banks involved in the Project Merlin talks, the Financial Times
reported, citing an unidentified Treasury Official. Bankers say
existing stringent regulations put the London financial industry
at an international disadvantage, cost hundreds of millions of
pounds to maintain and tie up funds that could be lent to
businesses and homeowners, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
