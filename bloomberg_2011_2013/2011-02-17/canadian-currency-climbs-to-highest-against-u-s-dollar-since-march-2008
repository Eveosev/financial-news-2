  Canada ’s dollar reached its
strongest level since March 2008 versus its U.S. counterpart as
crude oil traded at almost a two-year high over concern Middle
East tensions will disrupt shipments.  The loonie erased its gains and was the biggest loser among
the most-traded currencies tracked by Bloomberg after the
greenback and the Taiwanese dollar as U.S. data showing initial
jobless claims rose last week more than economists forecast
dimmed the prospects for the North American economic recovery.  “People are more likely to drive the Canadian dollar
northbound on any inkling that there’s going to be any
disruption to global oil supplies from the Middle East,” said  Andrew Wilkinson , senior market analyst at Interactive Brokers
Group LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut .  Canada’s currency traded at 98.43 cents per  U.S. dollar  at
5 p.m. in Toronto, compared with 98.49 yesterday, after touching
98.16 cents, its strongest level since March 13, 2008. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.016.    Brent crude  for April settlement fell 1 percent to $102.77
a barrel on ICE Futures Europe exchange in  London . The contract
rose yesterday to $103.78, the highest settlement since Sept.
25, 2008. Crude oil is Canada’s biggest export.  Canadian  government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the
10-year benchmark down two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.48 percent after they rose yesterday to 3.53
percent, the highest level since May 13. The 3.50 percent
security maturing in June 2020 increased 14 cents to C$100.15.  Citigroup’s View  The loonie may strengthen to 95 cents against the dollar, a
level last reached in November 2007, if the  Bank of Canada 
indicates in its March 1 policy statement that it will raise  interest rates  in April,  Greg Anderson , a currency strategist at
Citigroup Inc. in New York, wrote today in a research note.  If the central bank waits until April to deliver such a
signal, any gain to a level stronger than 98.30 cents will be
temporary, according to Anderson.  “We expect the Bank of Canada to be as dovish as possible
for as long as possible,” Anderson wrote.  Canada led the Group of Seven nations with three interest-
rate increases last year on signs of economic recovery after the
global recession. The Bank of Canada left its benchmark lending
rate at 1 percent on Jan. 18, where it has been since September.
The central bank’s Governor  Mark Carney  has called a
strengthening loonie a risk to the economy.  Governance of the global monetary order is “diffuse” and
“ineffective,” increasing inflation risks in emerging markets
and disinflation in advanced economies, Carney said at a
conference in Paris, where he will attend a two-day meeting of
finance ministers and central bankers starting tomorrow.  Wholesale Sales  The loonie traded within a cent of a two-year high as
Statistics Canada reported that wholesale sales increased 0.8
percent in December after a revised 1 percent advance in the
previous month. The median forecast of 11 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 0.9 percent gain.  Consumer prices, excluding food and fuel, rose 0.1 percent
in January after a 0.3 percent drop in the previous month,
according to the median forecast of 20 economists in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Statistics Canada  is scheduled to release its
report on inflation tomorrow.  The loonie has been supported by evidence of strength in
the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading partner. The Federal Reserve
Bank of Philadelphia’s general economic index rose to 35.9, the
highest level since January 2004. Readings greater than zero
signal expansion in eastern  Pennsylvania , southern  New Jersey 
and Delaware.  ‘Liking Canada’  “The market is liking Canada,” said Steve Butler,
director of foreign-exchange trading at Bank of Nova Scotia’s
Scotia Capital unit in Toronto. “We’ve seen better data out of
Canada, better data out of the U.S.”  In a sign the improvement in the U.S. labor market will
take time to develop, more Americans than projected filed first-
time claims for unemployment insurance last week.  Applications for jobless benefits increased by 25,000 to
410,000 in the week ended Feb. 12, exceeding the 400,000 median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News, Labor
Department figures showed today.  The Canadian dollar declined 1.2 percent to 7.2771 South
African rand, weakened 1 percent to 96.48 centimes versus the
Swiss franc, and slid 0.4 percent to 84.63 yen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
