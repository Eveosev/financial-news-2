Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index gained
0.2 percent to 4,937.60 at 11:06 a.m. in Sydney. New Zealand’s
NZX 50 Index gained 0.2 percent to 3,390.26 in Wellington.  The following are among the most active shares in the
market so far today. Stock symbols are in parentheses.  Bank stocks: Australia’s four biggest banks were little
changed in Sydney trading even as Moody’s Investors Service late
yesterday warned that the lenders and their New Zealand units
may have their ratings cut. The agency cited concern relating to
the banks’ access to overseas markets for funding, which will be
“significantly restrained.”    Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd . (ANZ AU) fell
0.1 percent to A$25.74, National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB AU)
was little-changed at A$26.32,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia 
(CBA AU) was little-changed at $53.90 and  Westpac Banking Corp .
(WBC AU) slid 0.1 percent to A$24.31.  All four banks currently hold Moody’s second-highest Aa1
rating and are likely to remain in the Aa category after the
review.  Bank of Queensland Ltd. (BOQ AU) climbed 1.2 percent to
A$10.18 after Credit Suisse Group AG raised its recommendation
for the Australian regional lender to “outperform” from
“neutral.”    AMP Ltd . (AMP AU) increased 0.9 percent to A$5.50 even as
Australia’s second-largest asset manager reported second-half
profit of A$350 million ($351.5 million), down 7 percent as
earnings at its wealth management unit declined. AMP was
expected to report earnings of A$349 million, according to the
average of four analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg News.    Austar United Communications Ltd . (AUN AU) rallied 4.2
percent to 99 Australian cents after the pay-television company
sold A$120 million worth of spectrum to Australia’s NBN Co. for
rural and regional areas.        Australand Property Group  (ALZ AU) rallied 2.3 percent to
A$3.13 after UBS AG raised its recommendation for the land and
housing development company to “neutral” from “sell.”        Qantas Airways Ltd . (QAN AU) jumped 4.6 percent to A$2.50
after Australia’s biggest airline posted net profit that more
than quadrupled in the first half to A$241 million. Sales
climbed 9.9 percent, boosted by a 9.1 percent increase in group
passenger numbers. The demand pickup helped the carrier to
withstand a 23-day grounding of its A380 fleet and A$55 million
in costs following a mid-air engine blowout.    Santos Ltd . (STO AU) gained 1.2 percent to A$13.97 after
the oil and gas producer reported a 15 percent increase in full-
year net income to A$500 million on higher commodity prices.
Analysts had forecast annual profit of A$535 million.  The  Reject Shop Ltd . (TRS AU) declined 1.2 percent to
A$12.93 after Goldman Sachs & Partners Australia Pty. lowered
its recommendation for the retailer to “hold” from “buy.”  New Zealand:    Vector Ltd . (VCT NZ) increased 2 percent to NZ$2.55 in
Wellington trading. The company has been selected by the New
Zealand government for prioritized talks to deliver an ultra-
fast broadband service in Auckland, putting it in competition
with Telecom Corp. (TEL NZ). Telecom’s shares dropped 0.9
percent to NZ$2.21.  To contact the reporter on this story:
