  TRW Automotive Holdings Corp ., the
world’s biggest vehicle-safety equipment supplier, rose as much
as 6.3 percent in  New York  after fourth-quarter profit topped
analysts’ estimates as the company kept costs under control.  TRW gained $2.36, or 4 percent, to $62 at 9:10 a.m., before
the start of regular trading on the New York Stock Exchange, and
earlier climbed as high as $63.40. Before today, the shares had
risen 13 percent this year after more than doubling in 2010.  Fourth-quarter profit climbed 45 percent to $204 million,
or $1.56 a share, from $141 million, or $1.18 a share, Livonia,
Michigan-based TRW said today in a statement. Excluding some
items, profit was $1.72 a share. Seven analysts in a Bloomberg
survey estimated profit of $1.24, on average.  Sales in the quarter rose 9.7 percent to $3.71 billion,
outpacing the 7.9 percent gain in the company’s cost of sales.
TRW pared net debt by $815 million to $768 million, a record low
for the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
