  Afghanistan  has named deputy foreign
minister Eklil Hakimi its new ambassador to the U.S., embassy
spokesman Abduljalil Ghafoory said tonight by telephone.  His appointment comes the same week that Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  is expected to name retired U.S. diplomat Marc
Grossman on Friday as the new special representative for
Afghanistan and Pakistan, to replace  Richard Holbrooke , who died
last December.  Hakimi submitted his credentials today to U.S. Deputy
Secretary of State James B. Steinberg, and is scheduled to
present credentials to President Barack Obama on February 23, at
the start of planned ministerial meetings between the U.S. and
Afghanistan in Washington.  Hakimi, who arrived in Washington on Feb. 14, according to
the embassy, formerly served as ambassador to Japan and  China .
In his new post, he will also be the top Afghan envoy to Mexico,
Brazil, Colombia and Argentina.  During his tenure as deputy foreign minister, Hakimi was
influential in strengthening ties with donor countries and in
regional cooperation and economic integration projects such as
the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline,
according to the embassy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
