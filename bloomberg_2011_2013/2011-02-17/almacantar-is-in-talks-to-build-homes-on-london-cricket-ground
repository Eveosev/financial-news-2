Almacantar SA, the real estate
company run by  Mike Hussey  and  Neil Jones , is in exclusive talks
to build homes on part of  Lord’s Cricket Ground  in the wealthy
London neighborhood of St. John’s Wood.  Marylebone Cricket Club selected Almacantar from among
three bidders to potentially build the homes as part of the
development of the Wellington Road side of the ground, according
to a  statement  released late yesterday on Lord’s website. The
talks may also involve improving conference and dining areas and
an indoor training center for the sports ground.  The 220-year-old cricket club, which hosts matches and
promotes the sport across Britain and overseas, plans to
increase seating at the ground and improve facilities for
members and spectators.  Almacantar  was established last year by Hussey, former
director in charge of Land Securities Group Plc’s London real
estate, and Jones, the former head of continental  Europe  at
Grosvenor Group Ltd., the property company controlled by family
trusts of the Duke of Westminster. They received backing from  Italy ’s Agnelli family and other investors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
