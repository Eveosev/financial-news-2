     Feb. 17 (Bloomberg) -  South Africa ’s FTSE/JSE Africa All
Share Index fell for a third day, losing 55.21, or 0.2 percent,
to 32,722.91 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.    Anglo American Plc  (AGL SJ), the diversified mining company
that makes up 11 percent of South Africa’s benchmark stock
index, declined to the lowest level since Feb. 2, losing 4.88
rand, or 1.3 percent, to 381.07 rand. Copper fell to the lowest
level since Jan. 31 as expanding stockpiles fueled concern that
demand may weaken.    AngloGold Ashanti Ltd . (ANG SJ), the world’s third-largest
producer of the precious metal, advanced for a fourth day in
five, increasing 3.65 rand, or 1.1 percent, to 335.95 rand, the
highest since Dec. 15. Chief Executive Officer  Mark Cutifani 
said the price of gold could “easily break through” $1,500 an
ounce and that the company plans to “sensibly kick-up” its
dividend in line with improved operational performance. He was
speaking on a conference call after the company said fourth-
quarter profit fell 3 percent from a year earlier.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BIL SJ), the world’s largest mining
company, dropped to the lowest level since Feb. 1, falling 3.10
rand, or 1.1 percent, to 284.15 rand. The company may spend $25
billion expanding its iron ore operations after yesterday
committing $80 billion to develop its own mines and oil fields,
Citigroup Inc. said.    Freeworld Coatings Ltd . (FWD SJ), a paint supplier,
advanced the most since Dec. 13, gaining 82 cents, or 7.5
percent, to 11.81 rand. South Africa’s Securities Regulation
Panel, which regulates takeovers, said an offer circular on a
takeover bid by Kansai Paint Co. Ltd. for the paint supplier
contains enough information for shareholders to make a decision.  Woolworths Holdings Ltd. (WHL SJ) had its biggest jump
since May 10, climbing 91 cents, or 3.7 percent, to 25.51 rand.
The clothing and food retailer said net income increased to 775
million rand in the first-half through December, from 662
million rand a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
