U.S. President Barack Obama will
make a state visit to the U.K. from May 24 to May 26 after he
accepted an invitation from  Queen Elizabeth II , according to a  Buckingham Palace  statement.  It will be the first presidential state visit to the U.K.
since George W. Bush’s in November 2003. Bush also stayed with
the queen at  Windsor Castle , west of London, in 2008, and Obama
 met  the British monarch at  Buckingham Palace , her London home,
during the Group of 20 summit in 2009.  “We are very pleased that this visit is taking place,”
Prime Minister David Cameron’s spokesman, Steve Field, told
reporters in London today. “It’s a sign of the strong and
enduring relationship between our two countries.”  Cameron extended the invitation, on behalf of the queen, in
July during his first trip to the U.S. as prime minister.  In  Washington , Jay Carney, Obama’s chief spokesman, said
the visit is “a sign of strength of the special relationship
between our two countries.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
