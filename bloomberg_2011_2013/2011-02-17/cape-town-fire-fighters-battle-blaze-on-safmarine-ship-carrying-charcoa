  Cape Town  fire-fighters are battling
a blaze on a board a British vessel owned by A.P. Moeller-Maersk
A/S’s Safmarine unit that was ferrying charcoal to Rotterdam,
Safmarine said.  Three containers of a shipment of nine carrying charcoal
caught fire while Safmarine Nomazwe was anchored off the port of
Cape Town, Safmarine said in a  statement  posted on its website
today. All the containers were removed from the ship and a probe
into the cause of the incident will be started, it said.  The ship was on its way to the Netherlands from Durban, on  South Africa ’s east coast, Theo Layne, a spokesman for the
city’s fire and rescue services division, said. It will probably
leave Cape Town at the end of the month, he said.  Five fire trucks and 60 fire-fighters were used to contain
the blaze, the South African Press Association said. One fire
engine and a water tanker are at the site of the fire, which
will probably take all day to extinguish, Layne said.  Details on which company the shipment was for won’t be
released until the investigation has been completed, Victor
Shieh, the marketing executive of Safmarine Container Lines
N.V., said by phone from Antwerp,  Belgium . No crew members were
injured and no pollution occurred as a result of the fire, he
said.  The Nomazwe container ship is 265 meters long and was built
in 2004, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
