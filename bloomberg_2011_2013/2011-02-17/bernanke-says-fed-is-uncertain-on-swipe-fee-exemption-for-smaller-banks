Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  told lawmakers the central bank’s governors are
uncertain that an exemption for lenders with less than $10
billion in assets from its proposed caps for debit-card “swipe
fees” will help the smaller lenders.  “We are not certain how effective that exemption will
be,” Bernanke said today at a Senate Banking Committee hearing
on implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act. “It is possible that
because merchants will reject more expensive cards from smaller
institutions or because networks will not be willing to
differentiate the interchange fee for issuers of different
sizes, it is possible that the exemption will not be effective
in the marketplace.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
