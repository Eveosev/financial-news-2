  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd ., the third-
largest producer of the metal, raised its dividend and paid back
debt faster than expected after a decision to eliminate gold
hedges increased spare funds.    Cash flow  from operations, excluding the cost of buying
back hedges, surged 60 percent to $679 million in the fourth
quarter from the previous three months, and rose 46 percent from
a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.  Chief Executive Officer  Mark Cutifani  is using the extra
funds to “sensibly kick up” dividends, repay debt and expand
production, he told reporters on a call from Johannesburg, where
the company is based. Cutifani spent about $6 billion over three
years to cancel hedges by Oct. 7.  Gold miners including  Barrick Gold Corp ., the biggest, are
cutting so-called forward sales contracts that they agreed on in
previous years to protect themselves from falling prices. As
prices have since rallied, the hedges have forced producers to
sell their output at below market rates. Barrick spent almost $5
billion to eliminate its forward contracts in 2009.  “The good news is that the hedge book is gone,” said
Christian Siebert, an analyst at Nedcor Securities in
Johannesburg. AngloGold now has “better exposure to the gold
price, which is good for cash flow.”  Shares Gain  AngloGold rose 1.1 percent to 335.95 rand at the 5 p.m.
close in Johannesburg trading. Gold for immediate delivery
climbed $8.83, or 0.6 percent, to $1,383.60 an ounce in  London .  The metal advanced for a 10th straight year in 2010,
reaching a record $1,431.25 an ounce on Dec. 7. It may push
above $1,500 an ounce in 2011, Cutifani told reporters today.  “As long as the hedge book was in place, we were fighting
with one hand tied behind our backs,” Cutifani said earlier in
an e-mailed statement. “Now that we’re selling our gold at spot
prices and entrenching business improvements across the
organization, we’re spinning off significant cash flow.”  AngloGold, 12 percent held by hedge fund Paulson & Co., cut
net debt to $1.3 billion last quarter, beating its November
guidance of $1.7 billion, and raised the annual dividend 12
percent to 1.45 rand.  Fourth-quarter profit fell 3 percent as the company spent
$1.06 billion clearing the last of its gold hedges. Third-
quarter income was boosted by an $82 million tax credit.
Earnings excluding the cost of canceling hedges dropped to $294
million, or $0.76 a share, from $303 million, or $0.82, in the
prior quarter, the company said. Analysts tracking local gold
producers compare consecutive quarters rather than year-on-year.  Output Forecast  Cutifani plans to boost production to between 4.55 million
and 4.75 million ounces this year from 4.52 million last year to
take advantage of higher prices. Fourth-quarter output was 1.15
million ounces and may fall to 1.04 million ounces this quarter,
a traditionally weak period as operations take time to ramp up
after December holidays.  The company, which operates the world’s deepest gold mines,
produces about 40 percent of its metal in  South Africa .  AngloGold plans to begin digging the Tropicana mine in  Western Australia  this year at a cost of about $700 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
