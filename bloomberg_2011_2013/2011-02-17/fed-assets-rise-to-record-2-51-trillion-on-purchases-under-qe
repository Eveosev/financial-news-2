The  Federal Reserve ’s total assets
rose by $8.73 billion to $2.51 trillion as the central bank
bought  Treasury securities  as part of the second round of its
quantitative easing strategy.  Treasuries held by the Fed rose by $23.3 billion to $1.19
trillion as of yesterday, according to a weekly release by the
central bank today. The Fed’s holdings of mortgage-backed
securities fell by $6.63 billion to $958.4 billion and federal
agency debt fell by $259 million to $144.4 billion.  The central bank has purchased $345.4 billion in Treasuries
since Nov. 12 under plans to purchase $600 billion of government
debt through June and reinvest proceeds from maturing mortgage
debt. The unconventional monetary easing is aimed at spurring
economic growth and preventing inflation from falling too low.  The Fed said the M2  money supply  rose by $5.6 billion in
the week ended Feb. 7. That left M2 growing at an annual rate of
3.8 percent for the past 52 weeks, above the target of 5 percent
the Fed once set for maximum growth. The Fed no longer has a
formal target.  The Fed reports two measures of the money supply each week.
M1 includes all currency held by consumers and companies for
spending, money held in checking accounts and travelers checks.
M2, the more widely followed, adds savings and private holdings
in money market mutual funds.  For the latest reporting week, M1 fell by $34.8 billion,
and over the past 52 weeks, M1 rose by 9 percent. The Fed no
longer publishes figures for M3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
