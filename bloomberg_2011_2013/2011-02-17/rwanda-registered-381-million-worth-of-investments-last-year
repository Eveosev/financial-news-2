  Rwanda  attracted domestic and
foreign investment of $381 million last year, down from $541
million in 2009, the  Rwanda Development Board  said.  The government is targeting investment of $550 million this
year, according to an e-mailed statement today from the board,
based in Kigali, the capital. Of last year’s investment, $173
million came from abroad.  “In 2009, we registered some big deals,” Clare Akamanzi,
chief operations officer at the board, said by text message
today. “We didn’t have such big deals in 2010 but expect them
in 2011,” she said, without giving details.  U.S.-based ContourGlobal LLC registered much of its
investment in 2009 for a project to extract methane gas from
Lake Kivu and use it to generate electricity. Investment may
rise this year after the 2010 World Bank Doing  Business Report 
ranked Rwanda the second top global reformer out of 183 surveyed
countries in doing business.  The ranking was attributed to the ease of acquiring a
construction permit and setting up a public credit registry as
well as improving efficiency in clearance at the country’s
border posts.  Rwanda’s exports, including revenue from tourism, increased
24 percent to $454.5 million last year, according to the board.  “Tourism dominated with 44 percent of total exports,
followed by mining and coffee with 14.9 percent and 12.3 percent
respectively,” it said. Imports increased 11.4 percent to $1.3
billion over the same period.  Rwanda’s economy grew 7.4 percent in 2010 on an 8.1 percent
expansion in services, Finance Minister John Rwangombwa said on
Feb. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
