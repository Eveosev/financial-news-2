  Itron Inc ., a maker of utility
meters, communications equipment and electricity-management
software, dropped the most in seven months after reporting that
2011 sales will be less than analysts had expected.  Itron fell $6.36, or 10 percent, to $57.26 a share at 11:37
a.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading. Earlier the shares declined
13 percent to $55.18, the largest percentage drop since July 22.
They have gained 2.8 percent so far this year.  Profit this year excluding some items is expected to be
$3.95 to $4.40 a share on sales of $2.15 billion to $2.3
billion, the Liberty Lake, Washington-based company said in a
statement after the close of trading yesterday. Itron was
expected to earn $4.37 a share on sales of $2.33 billion,
according to the average estimates of 28 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We remain bullish on smart meters but given the lack of
large project bookings, shipments are beginning to flatten
out,”  John Hardy , an analyst at Gleacher & Co. in  New York  who
has a “neutral” rating on the shares, wrote in a research note
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
