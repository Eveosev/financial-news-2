European stocks climbed for a fifth
day, extending a 2 1/2-year high for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index,
as earnings from  Cap Gemini SA  and PPR SA topped estimates and
the index of U.S. leading indicators rose for a seventh month.    Cap Gemini , Europe’s biggest computer-services company,
jumped 7.6 percent and PPR, the owner of the Gucci luxury label,
advanced 2.2 percent.  Technip SA  gained 1.9 percent after
Europe’s second-biggest oilfield-services provider swung to a
profit in the fourth quarter.  The Stoxx 600 rose 0.2 percent to 291.16 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London , the highest level since August 2008. The gauge
has climbed 5.6 percent this year amid speculation the economic
recovery is accelerating and policies to support indebted euro-
region countries will be successful. The rally has pushed its
valuation to more than 15 times the reported profits of its
companies, near the highest in nine months, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Earnings have been improving, with better top line and
margins,” said Lionel Heurtin, a  fund manager  at Ofi Asset
Management in Paris, which oversees $1.7 billion in stocks.
“Some say the market is overbought in the short term, so we
could have a correction, but I remain positive for the longer
term.”  Reports in the U.S. today showed the Conference Board’s
gauge of the economic outlook for the next three to six months

run Press TV said the nation is arranging with Egyptian
officials to have two of its warships use the Suez Canal. The  Suez Canal  Authority said after the report that no Iranian naval
vessels had been granted permission to sail through the
waterway. The Stoxx 600 later rallied to close higher.  “It is not clear what the action of the warships is, but
anything that creates tension in the Middle East -- and
specifically in the Suez Canal -- will send shivers to the
commodities and financial markets,” said Luis Benguerel, an
equities trader at Interbrokers in Barcelona, Spain.  Cap Gemini Gains  Cap Gemini surged 7.6 percent to 42.89 euros, the biggest
gain since May. The computer-services company said full-year
