The U.K.  Competition Commission  is
studying evidence from BAA Airports Ltd. and other entities to
establish whether there have been any “significant
developments” that could cause it to “reconsider” its March
2009 decision to force BAA to sell Stansted and Glasgow or
Edinburgh airports, the  Competition Commission  said in an e-
mailed statement today. The process began in November 2010, the
statement said.  The U.K.’s Supreme Court today refused BAA’s request for an
appeal against the Competition Commission’s decision  To contact the reporter on this story:
