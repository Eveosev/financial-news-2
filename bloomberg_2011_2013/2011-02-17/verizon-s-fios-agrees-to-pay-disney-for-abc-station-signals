  Verizon Communications Inc .’s FiOS
pay-TV service will start paying  Walt Disney Co . for access to
local signals from 10 ABC stations owned by the media company.  The agreement is part of a broader deal giving FiOS
subscribers online access to Disney’s ESPN cable programs, while
also covering Disney cable channels ABC Family, Disney Channel
and Disney Junior, the companies said today in a statement.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  The ABC agreement advances Disney’s efforts to receive so-
called retransmission fees from pay-TV carriers for signals that
are available free over the air. Disney has similar deals with  Cablevision Systems Corp ., the New York-area cable company, and
with New York-based Time Warner Cable Inc.  The accord covering the cable channels and ESPN online was
announced in October. Starting today, Verizon’s 3.3 million FiOS
customers have access to ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU and ESPN Buzzer
Beater, which provides live clips of college basketball games,
through personal computers and mobile devices.  Disney, based in Burbank, California, rose 5 cents to
$43.75 at 11:59 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite
trading. The shares had advanced 17 percent this year before
today, the second-highest gain among stocks in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average. Verizon, based in New York, added 22 cents
to $36.39.  To contact the reporter on this story:
