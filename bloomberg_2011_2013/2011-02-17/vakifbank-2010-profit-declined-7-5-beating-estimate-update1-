  Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO , a
Turkish bank in which the government owns a 75 percent stake,
said profit last year fell 7.5 percent to 1.16 billion liras
($734 million,) beating estimates.  Net income declined from 1.25 billion liras in 2009,
Vakifbank said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange 
today. The bank was expected to earn 1.11 billion liras,
according to the average of 27 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Turkish banksâ€™ profit margins are being squeezed amid
increased competition for loans between lenders that also
include Citigroup Inc. and HSBC Holdings Plc. Banks have also
started switching cash from  government bonds  to lending as
yields fell to a record low.  Vakifbank rose 3 kurus, or 0.7 percent, to 4.11 liras at
5:30 p.m. in Istanbul. The main  ISE National 100 index  gained
0.9 percent.  Profit in the fourth quarter was 392.6 million liras,
rising 26 percent from a year ago. The figure was calculated
by subtracting third-quarter earnings from full-year profit. The
bank was expected to report fourth-quarter earnings of
330.2 million liras, according to the average estimate of 12
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Net interest income in the whole of 2010 dropped 11 percent
to 2.73 billion liras. Net fees and commissions declined 5
percent to 443.3 million liras in the period, the bank said in
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
