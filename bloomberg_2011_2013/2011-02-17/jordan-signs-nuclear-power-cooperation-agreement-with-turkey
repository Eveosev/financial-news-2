Jordan, which plans to build its
first nuclear reactor later this decade, signed an agreement
with  Turkey  on cooperating to develop atomic energy.  “Jordan will benefit from the distinguished Turkish
experience in developing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes,”
Energy and Mineral Resources Minister Khalid Touqan said today
in the capital, Amman.  Touqan signed the accord with Zafer Alper, president of the
Turkish Atomic Energy Authority.  Jordan relies almost entirely on imported energy and is
turning to nuclear power to meet increasing electricity demand.
It plans to build reactors by 2019 and will choose a supplier of
its first nuclear plant by April, Touqan said last year. It has
signed nuclear-cooperation agreements with 11 countries, most
recently with  Italy  on Feb. 14.  To contact the reporter on this story:
