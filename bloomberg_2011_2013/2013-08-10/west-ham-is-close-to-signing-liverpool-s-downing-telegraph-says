West Ham is closing in on the
signing of Liverpool winger  Stewart Downing , the  Daily Telegraph 
reported.  West Ham has already made a 5 million-pound ($7.8 million)
bid and talks between the club continue, with Liverpool hoping
to raise the price closer to 6 million pounds, the Telegraph
said.  Downing earlier rejected a move to West Ham but is now more
open to the prospect of joining the London club, the Telegraph
said. He went to Liverpool from Aston Villa two years ago for 20
million pounds.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
