Asian stocks fell, with  the
benchmark index  capping the first weekly drop in seven weeks, as
the yen’s gain weighed on Japanese shares and earnings from HSBC
Holdings Plc to Nikon Corp. disappointed investors.  Mazda Motor Corp. (7261) , a Japanese carmaker that gets 30 percent
of its revenue in North America, slumped 6.6 percent. HSBC,
Europe’s biggest bank, had its biggest one-week loss in more
than a year after net income missed estimates. Nikon Corp.
plunged to the lowest since January 2012 after the Japanese
camera maker cut its full-year net income target. Fonterra
Shareholders Fund, a unit trust of Fonterra Cooperative Group
Ltd, recouped losses in Wellington after the world’s biggest
dairy exporter said its board would conduct a formal review into
a contamination scare.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index dropped 1.25 percent to 133.89,
snapping six weeks of gains through Aug. 2, its longest winning
streak since January. Shares fell even as data showed  China ’s
trade beat estimates and inflation stayed subdued.  “This week, we’ve had some strength in the yen, which has
been one of the key drivers,” said  Garry Evans , head of global
equity strategy at HSBC in Hong Kong. On Japanese earnings,
“people have overestimated the impact of a weak yen. In the
rest of Asia, it’s a bit too early to tell.”  The MSCI Asia gauge has dropped 7.3 percent from a five-year high reached in May as investors weigh when the  Federal
Reserve  may start reducing its record stimulus.  Asia’s benchmark share index  traded  at 13 times average
estimated earnings yesterday, compared with multiples of 15.34
for the  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  and 13.95 for the Europe
STOXX 600 Index, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Yen, Exporters  Japan’s  Topix index  dropped 4.6 percent after the yen rose
to a seven-week high against the dollar. A stronger yen cuts the
value of overseas earnings at Japanese companies. Mazda slumped
6.6 percent to 412 yen. Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s biggest
carmaker, slid 4 percent to 6,170 yen. Canon Inc., the world’s
biggest carmaker, lost 2.9 percent to 3,065 yen.  South Korea’s Kospi Index lost 2.2 percent. Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index retreated 1.2 percent after the  Reserve Bank 
of Australia cut the overnight cash-rate target to a record-low
2.5 percent and lowered its growth outlook. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index dropped 1.1 percent in Wellington.  Singapore’s Straits Times Index slipped 0.7 percent in the
first three days of the week before markets shut for public
holidays. Taiwan’s Taiex Index dropped 3 percent. Hong Kong’s
Hang Seng Index declined 1.7 percent. China’s Shanghai Composite
Index added 1.1 percent.  China Exports  China’s exports rose 5.1 percent from a year earlier in
July and imports gained 10.9 percent, the government reported on
Aug. 8. The  consumer price index  increased 2.7 percent from a
year earlier in July, separate data showed yesterday.  “We’ve had a little better data recently, which suggest
growth in China is stabilizing, but the bottom line is China’s
growth is going to disappoint many investors in the next year or
two,” Evans at HSBC said.  Of the 548 companies on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index that
have posted results since July 1 and for which estimates are
available, 50.2 percent exceeded estimates, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  HSBC declined 4.6 percent to HK$84.75 in Hong Kong, the
biggest weekly drop since the period ended May 18, 2012. First-half net income totaled $10.28 billion, missing the $10.57
billion estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and Chief
Executive Officer  Stuart Gulliver  said the lender’s fast-growing
 emerging markets  are slowing.  Nikon, Fonterra  Nikon plunged 16 percent to 1,726 yen in  Tokyo , the lowest
since Jan. 17, 2012. Nikon on Aug. 8 cut its full-year net
income target by 23 percent to 50 billion yen ($517 million)
from a 65 billion-yen forecast in May, as demand for compact
cameras weakens.  Fonterra advanced 0.8 percent to NZ$7.20 after locating and
removing all dairy products affected by a potentially
contaminated ingredient. The dairy exporter on Aug. 3 said that
a dirty pipe at a processing plant may have tainted whey
protein, prompting China and  Russia  to halt imports of some
Fonterra products and causing a spate of recalls in China,
 Vietnam ,  Thailand , Sri Lanka and  New Zealand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
