San Diego Chargers linebacker  Manti
Te’o  sprained his right foot and will miss an Aug. 15 road game
against the  Chicago Bears , the team said on its website.  The former Notre Dame standout, who injured the foot in a
31-10 loss to  Seattle  on Aug. 8, watched practice yesterday in a
walking boot, according to the  Associated Press .  Coach Mike McCoy wouldn’t say exactly how Te’o, a starter
in the defensive lineup, injured the foot.  “I think any player is a little disappointed when they
have a little injury that will keep them out for a little bit,”
McCoy said in a  statement.  “But it’s part of the game and he’ll
do whatever he can to get back on the field as quickly as
possible.” During a news conference on Aug. 9, the coach said
no one had reported any serious injuries. But yesterday he said
the injury was diagnosed after the game.  McCoy  hasn’t been forthcoming with injury news this summer.
Wide receiver Danario Alexander was lost for the season after
tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee at
practice Aug. 6, but the coach downplayed the injury after the
workout, then announced it a few hours later, according to AP.  Running back  Danny Woodhead  missed practice yesterday and
McCoy wouldn’t say what the injury was or when he is expected to
return.  The team wouldn’t make Te’o, the Heisman Trophy runner-up
who was chosen 38th overall in this year’s  National Football
League  draft, available to reporters yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
