Italian and Spanish government bonds
rose for a fourth week, the longest streak since May, after an
improvement in euro-area services output and German factory
orders spurred demand for the region’s higher-yielding assets.  Italy’s 10-year yield dropped to the  lowest  in eight weeks,
narrowing the spread versus German securities, as separate data
showed the nation’s recession eased in the second quarter. Greek
bonds advanced for a fifth week. German bunds declined as signs
the euro area is recovering from a record-long recession damped
demand for the region’s safest assets. Trading volumes declined
as investors awaited the next Federal Reserve policy meeting and
 Germany ’s federal election.  “There has been some improvement in data and the tone in
peripherals has been fairly constructive,” said Peter Goves, a
fixed-income strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  London . “Spreads
have tightened to Germany. In the absence of negative catalysts,
this will probably continue in the near-term. That said, the
euro-area economy is far from pre-crisis levels.”  Italy’s  10-year yield  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, this week to 4.19 percent at 5 p.m. in London
yesterday, after reaching 4.17 percent, the lowest since June
10. The 4.5 percent bond maturing in May 2023 rose 0.505, or
5.05 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,334) face amount, to 102.795.  Similar-maturity  Spanish yields  dropped seven basis points
to 4.50 percent after reaching 4.48 percent yesterday, the
lowest since June 6.  Services Rise  An index of activity in the euro-area services industry
based on a survey of  purchasing managers  rose to 49.8 in July
from 48.3 a month earlier, Markit Economics said on Aug. 5.
German factory orders increased 3.8 percent in June, a
government report showed on Aug. 6.  The rate on  Greece (GGGB10YR) ’s bond due in February 2023 dropped 22
basis points this week to 9.72 percent.  German 10-year (GDBR10)  bund
yields increased three basis points to 1.68 percent.  The volume of benchmark bund futures traded declined to an
average 460,900 contracts over the past five days, from 726,000
during the 12 months through last week.  “The bonds are on autopilot through the summer lull and
bund volumes are extremely low,” said Marius Daheim, a senior
fixed-income strategist at  Bayerische Landesbank  in Munich. “A
lot of people have decided that they want to be neutral at
current levels, until they see the outcome of the German
elections and what the Fed will do. As long as these things are
looming, people will just stay on the sidelines.”  Germany’s election will be held on Sept. 22, while the
Fed’s Open Market Committee meets on Sept. 17-18.  Analysts said a report next week will show the euro-region
economy pulled out of recession in the second quarter.  Gross
domestic product  increased 0.2 percent in the three months ended
June, snapping six quarters of contraction, according to a
Bloomberg survey before the data is released on Aug. 14.  Italian bonds returned 4.2 percent this year through Aug.
8, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Spanish securities
gained 7.1 percent, while German bonds lost 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
