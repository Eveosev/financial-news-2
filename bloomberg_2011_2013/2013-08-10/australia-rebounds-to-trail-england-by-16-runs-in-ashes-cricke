Chris Rogers ’s first Test century
helped Australia rebound from a slow start to trail England by
16 runs in the Ashes.  Rogers was 101 not out as Australia reached 222-5 after day
two of the fourth cricket Test at Chester-le-Street, England, in
reply to the host’s first innings 238.  Brad Haddin  was on 12 at
stumps.  England’s Stuart Broad took three wickets in the first 13.1
overs and Tim Bresnan claimed  Steve Smith  to leave Australia on
76-4. Rogers and  Shane Watson  then put up a 129-run fifth wicket
partnership before Watson was dismissed by Broad, who finished
the day with 4-48.  The 35-year-old Rogers reached the century mark three overs
later with a four through square leg. Bad light stopped play for
the day 20 balls later.  England resumed on 238-9 this morning and lost its
remaining wicket when Jackson Bird bowled out James Anderson
with the final ball of the second over.  Nathan Lyon took 4-42 for the visitors, while Bird, making
his Ashes debut, and  Ryan Harris  claimed two wickets each.
Captain Alastair Cook led England with 51 runs and Jonathan Trott scored 49.  England retained the Ashes trophy it won two years ago in
Australia with a draw in the third Test after wins in the first
two games of the five-match series.  To contact the reporter on this story:
