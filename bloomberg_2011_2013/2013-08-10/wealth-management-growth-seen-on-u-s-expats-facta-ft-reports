More  wealth management  firms are
likely to come into existence to give tax advice to U.S.
citizens living abroad after the implementation of the Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act, the Financial Times reported, citing
RBC Capital Markets analyst Peter Lenardos.  Brown Advisory, based in Baltimore, opened a U.K. private
client business in January, and Tanager Wealth Management was
set up last year by Kristopher Heck, the newspaper reported.  More specialist companies are expected to be formed for
U.S. investors taxed on global income as they are increasingly
turned away by banks and private wealth managers, which decided
the U.S. tax rules make serving such clients too expensive to be
worthwhile, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
