Italy’s Luna Rossa completed a 4-0
sweep over Swedish syndicate Artemis Racing to meet Emirates
Team New Zealand in the America’s Cup challenger finals.  Luna Rossa’s 72-foot (30-meter) catamaran defeated Artemis
Racing Aug. 9 by two minutes, 11 seconds to sweep the best-of-seven semi-final series on  San Francisco Bay .  Artemis is operating a new boat that was put into training
July 22 after its first boat capsized during a training run on
May 9, trapping crew member Andrew Simpson beneath.  After taking an early lead, Artemis was penalized for
touching the Italian boat during the pre-start and then received
two more penalties for sailing out of bounds during the race,
according to  America’sCup.com .  The best-of-13 Louis Vuitton Cup final starts Aug. 17. The
winner faces defending champion Oracle Team USA in the 34th
America’s Cup starting Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
