Michelin-starred chef  Heston Blumenthal  needs a hip replacement at the age of 47 after long
working hours and strenuous exercise, the  Daily Mail  reported,
citing the U.K. restaurateur.  The average age for a hip operation in the U.K. is 67, and
young patients wear out their hips through intensive exercises,
alcohol binging, or arthritis, according to the report.  Blumenthal has had two titanium rods inserted at the base
of his spine for chronic back pain, according to the newspaper.
The chef broke a bone in his hand playing cricket four years ago
and broke his shoulder last April skiing, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
