Miguel Cabrera , Torii Hunter and
Austin Jackson each hit home runs as the Detroit Tigers beat the
New York Yankees 9-3, a day after having their 12-game winning
streak halted with a 10-inning loss at Yankee Stadium.  Cabrera had three hits, including his 35th homer of the
season in the third inning, and Jackson homered in the fifth as
the Tigers tacked on four more runs to open a 6-0 lead.  Yankees starting pitcher  Phil Hughes  allowed four earned
runs over 4 1/3 innings and now has an 11.45 earned run average
over his past three appearances. Heâ€™s 1-7 in his past 10 starts,
dropping to 4-11 on the Major League Baseball season.  Hunter added a three-run home run in the sixth inning off
Yankees reliever Joba Chamberlain to put the Tigers up 9-2.  Lyle Overbay drove in all three runs for the Yankees, with
a two-run homer in the fifth inning and a run-scoring single in
the bottom of the ninth. Anibal Sanchez allowed two runs over
seven innings to pick up the win for the Tigers.  Detroit, which had 17 hits, improved to 69-46 and is 7 1/2
games ahead of the  Cleveland Indians  atop the American League
Central Division. The Yankees are 58-57 and 10 1/2 games behind
the first-place  Boston Red Sox  in the AL East.  To contact the reporter on this story:
