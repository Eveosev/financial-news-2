Treasury 30-year bonds rose for the
first time in three weeks as U.S. auctions of $72 billion of
securities including long bonds at two-year-high yields
attracted above-average demand from foreign investors.  Benchmark 10-year yields traded within the narrowest weekly
range since April amid speculation about whether the  Federal
Reserve  may start to reduce bond purchases in September. The
central bank has been purchasing $85 billion in Treasuries and
mortgages each month in a program known as quantitative easing
to put downward pressure on  interest rates . A report next week
is forecast to show consumer prices increased 0.2 percent in
July, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The week’s auctions were very strong and there has been
more reluctance for investors to extend into riskier markets,
which also supports Treasuries,” said  Christopher Sullivan , who
oversees $2.1 billion as chief investment officer at United
Nations Federal Credit Union in  New York . “The yield rise has
been arrested to some degree, as the possibility of Fed tapering
is now largely priced in.”  The yield on 30-year bonds fell five basis points this
week, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.63 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 3.625 percent
security due August 2043 traded at 99 26/32.  The benchmark 10-year note yield fell two basis points to
2.58 percent, after touching the lowest level since July 31.  Bond Returns  Investors in U.S. government securities  have lost  2.5
percent this year, according to the Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond
Index.  U.S. debt  gained 2 percent in 2012.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  reversed  to
a net-short position in 10-year note futures in the week ending
Aug. 6, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 20,096 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade.  Last week, traders were net-long 11,903
contracts.  The 30-year bonds sold on Aug. 8 drew a yield of 3.652
percent. That compared with 3.66 percent at a previous auction
of similar-maturity debt on July 11, which was the highest in
almost two years.  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 40.2 percent of the bonds, compared
with an average of 37.2 percent for the past 10 sales. Primary
dealers purchased 42.7 percent, below the 48.5 percent average
of the past 10 auctions.  Auction Update  At the Aug. 7 sale of 10-year notes, indirect bidders
purchased 46.3 percent of the debt, compared with an average of
37.1 percent for the past 10 sales. At an auction of three-year
securities the previous day, indirect bidders bought 41.4
percent of the notes, the most since August 2011 and above the
average of 26.1 percent at the past 10 sales.  Demand comes amid data indicating foreign investors were
adding Treasuries at the slowest pace since 2006 as holdings by
non-U.S. investors rose 1.9 percent through May, down from 5.2
percent a year ago, data released in July by the Treasury
showed.  Fed officials “said ’if economic data allows,’ so in the
back of people’s minds, there still is a chance they may not
taper in September,” said Jason Rogan, director of U.S.
government trading at Guggenheim Partners LLC, a New York-based
brokerage for institutional investors. “It’s why the auctions
went pretty well.”  Reduced Demand  Investors bid $2.90 for each dollar of the $1.329 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index  was  75.40 yesterday. It
touched 117.89 on July 5, the highest level since December 2010.
The average for 2013 is 67.34.  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed to a two-year high of
2.75 percent on July 8 from a low this year of 1.61 percent on
May 1. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  rattled markets in May and
June by outlining a plan to end the central bank’s stimulus
program of asset purchases.  “You’re waiting for some type of information to give you
an inkling into the time frame that the Fed’s looking at,” said
Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury trading in New
York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “They were looking for
affirmation that the Fed would be tapering in September. We need
a new catalyst from here to generate some movement.”  Fed officials indicated greater willingness this week to
begin tapering stimulus.  “I would clearly not rule” out a decision to start
dialing back the purchases at the Sept. 17-18 gathering of the
 Federal Open Market Committee , Chicago Fed President  Charles
Evans  said on Aug. 6. “We’ve seen good improvement in the labor
market, there’s no question in my mind about that.”  Benchmark 10-year yields will end the year at 2.74 percent,
according to the median of a Bloomberg News survey of analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
