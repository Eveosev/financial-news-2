California Governor  Jerry Brown  will
seek a court-ordered cooling-off period tomorrow to head off a
strike by San Francisco’s rapid transit system, his office said.  The state sent a petition for a temporary restraining order
to state court in San Francisco and asked for a hearing tomorrow
to delay any strike for 60 days, according to a court filing
provided by the governor’s office. The filing couldn’t be
immediately confirmed in court records.  The court will consider the petition tomorrow if the Bay
Area Rapid Transit District and its unions don’t resolve their
contract dispute sooner, Brown’s office said yesterday in an e-mail.  A strike of the 400,000-rider-a-day system would cost the
region $73 million a day and will endanger public health, safety
and welfare, attorneys for the governor said in the filing.  The case is People Ex Rel. Edmund G. Brown v. Amalgamated
Transit Union, Local 1555,  San Francisco  Superior Court (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
