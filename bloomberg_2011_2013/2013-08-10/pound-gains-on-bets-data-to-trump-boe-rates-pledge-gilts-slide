The pound posted its biggest weekly
gain versus the dollar in a month on speculation data showing
the U.K. economy is gathering pace will prevent the Bank of
England from keeping interest rates at a record low.  Sterling strengthened the most since April against the euro
after gauges of services and house prices rose in July, while
industrial production expanded and the U.K. trade deficit shrank
in June. The U.K. currency rose to a seven-week high against the
greenback after the central bank led by Governor Mark Carney
pledged to reduce inflation to its 2 percent target and keep
borrowing costs low. Gilts slid for a third week as the data
damped demand for the safest assets.  “The complexity of the forward guidance has certainly
backfired” and supported the pound, said Jane Foley, a senior
currency strategist at Rabobank International in  London ,
referring to Carney’s comments on interest rates. “The bank may
have to start paying more attention to inflation and may
actually be a bit more hawkish.”  The pound climbed 1.4 percent in the week to $1.5505 at
4:58 p.m. London time yesterday, its biggest five-day gain since
the period ending July 12. It rose to $1.5574 on Aug. 8, its
highest level since June 19. The U.K. currency advanced 0.9
percent to 86.03 pence per euro, having reached 85.79 on Aug. 7,
the strongest since July 10.  Sterling rose after the central bank said on Aug. 7 it
would keep benchmark interest rates at or near the current 0.5
percent level until unemployment falls to 7 percent.  Services Growth  Data in the week showed  services growth  accelerated to the
fastest pace in more than six years, home prices climbed for a
sixth month, industrial production in June beat analyst
estimates and manufacturing surged the most in a year. That
added to reports last week showing gauges of U.K. factory output
and construction beat estimates.  The annualized inflation rate decelerated to 2.8 percent in
July from 2.9 percent the previous month, according to the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey before the
report next week.  The pound has risen 1.2 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro rose 3.2 percent and
the dollar gained 0.7 percent.  The yield on 10-year gilts advanced four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, in the week to 2.46 percent after
reaching 2.56 percent on Aug. 7, the highest since June 25. The
1.75 percent security due September 2022 slid 0.26, or 2.60
pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.26.  The Debt Management Office is scheduled to sell 2.25
billion pounds of 4.5 percent bonds due in 2034 on Aug. 15.  U.K. government bonds have lost 3.6 percent this year
through Aug. 8, Bloomberg World Bond Indexes show. German
securities dropped 1.4 percent and Treasuries declined 2.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
