Some U.K. households may see their
water bills rise under proposals for compulsory water meters in
the interest of water conservation, the  Daily Telegraph 
reported, citing research by the Consumer Council for Water.  The annual bill for a family of four would increase to 700
pounds ($1,087) from about 500 pounds, according to the report.  Ministers have ordered nine of the 24 regional water
companies in  England  and  Wales  to consider compulsory metering
in all of the homes they serve, the Telegraph said. About 35
percent of homes in the country are fitted with water meters, it
said.  “No water company is required to introduce compulsory
metering, even if it is in an area of severe water stress,” the
Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs  said  today on
its website. “Metering is just one of many ways water companies
can manage water resources in their area.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
