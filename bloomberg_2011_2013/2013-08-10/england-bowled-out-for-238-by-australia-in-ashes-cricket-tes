England was bowled out for its
overnight total of 238 by Australia on the second day of the
fourth Ashes cricket Test.  Australia needed just one wicket after claiming nine
yesterday in Chester-le-Street, England, and Jackson Bird took
it by bowling out  James Anderson  with the final ball of the
second over.  Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon took 4-42, while captain
 Alastair Cook  was Englandâ€™s top scorer with 51.  England has already retained the Ashes trophy after a draw
in the third Test followed wins in the first two games of the
five-match series.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
