Italy’s Luna Rossa moved within one
race win of meeting Emirates Team New Zealand in the America’s
Cup challenger finals.  Luna Rossa’s 72-foot (30-meter) catamaran defeated Artemis
Racing yesterday by one minute, 18 seconds to take a 3-0 lead in
the best-of-seven series on  San Francisco Bay . The team advances
to the Louis Vuitton Cup final with a victory today.  “After the start we sailed probably our best race on the
water as a team, which is good because tomorrow’s going to be
tough,” Luna Rossa skipper Max Sirena said yesterday. “Artemis
Racing is getting quicker and quicker every day and it’s not
finished yet.”  Artemis is operating a new boat that was put into training
July 22 after its first boat capsized during a training run on
May 9, trapping crew member Andrew Simpson beneath.  “We upped our game hugely today, but the bad news for
Artemis Racing was so did Luna Rossa,” said Artemis skipper
Iain Percy. “Now it’s sudden death tomorrow and we like that.
We look forward to that pressure.”  The Louis Vuitton Cup final starts Aug. 17. The winner
faces defending champion Oracle Team USA in the 34th America’s
Cup starting Sept. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
