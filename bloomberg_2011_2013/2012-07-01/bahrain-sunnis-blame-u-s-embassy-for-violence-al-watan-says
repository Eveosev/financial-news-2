Bahrain ’s  al-Asalah Islamic Society 
blamed the U.S ambassador in Bahrain Thomas Krajeski for the
spread in violence among the Kingdom’s dissidents groups, Al-
Watan reported, citing a statement from the society.  The society, a leading Sunni formation in Bahrain, said
that the ambassador’s “incorrect” reports and his inability to
condemn “clearly and explicitly” the use of Molotov cocktails
by protesters, in addition to the U.S. government’s pressure on
Bahrain to release “convicted terrorist” has led to more
violence against the state, the newspaper reported.  Bahraini MP Abdul Halim Murad told the  daily  that Krajeski
is becoming “a threat to the national security of Bahrain and
the Gulf.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
