Israel’s banks, led by  Bank Leumi Le-
Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  and  Bank Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI) , rallied the most in more
than three months on optimism an agreement by European leaders
on banks may contain the region’s debt crisis.  Leumi rose 5.5 percent, the most since Nov. 30, to 9.91
shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . Hapoalim  advanced 
4.5 percent, the most since March 14, to 12.40 shekels.  Mizrahi
Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF)  gained 2.4 percent to 30.56 shekels and  Israel
Discount Bank (DSCT)  increased 3.9 percent to 4.134 shekels, also the
most since March 14.  The MSCI World Bank Index (MXWO0BK)  of developed markets surged 3.6
percent on June 29 after European policy makers eased repayment
rules for Spanish banks, relaxed conditions for possible aid to
Italy and unveiled a $149 billion economic growth plan.  “Israeli banks are recovering from Thursday’s sell-off and
on the back of the strong performance of the banking sector
overseas,” said Daniel Rapoport, head of equity and derivatives
at  Bank Leumi .  To contact the reporter on this story:
