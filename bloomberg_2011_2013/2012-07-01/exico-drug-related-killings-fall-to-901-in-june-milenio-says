Killings related to drug violence in
Mexico fell 17 percent in June from the month before, reaching
the lowest level this year, the newspaper Milenio reported today
on its  website .  Last month’s death toll of 901 pushed the number of
killings since President  Felipe Calderon  took office in December
2006 to 53,074, according to the Mexico City-based daily. The
number of killings in May reached 1,091, Milenio reported on
June 1.  During the first six months of this year, 6,129 people were
killed in incidents related to drug violence, Milenio said.  Last month, Chihuahua, Sinaloa and Coahuila were the states
with the most killings. The state of Mexico registered the
biggest increase in killings with a total of 61 from 22 in June,
the newspaper said.  Drug-related murders totaled 47,515 from December 2006
through September 2011, the attorney general’s office said on
