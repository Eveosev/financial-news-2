Arnaud Montebourg ,  France ’s minister
for productive recovery, said a public investment bank will be
created by the end of the year, Le Parisien  reported  in its
Sunday edition, citing an interview.  The law to create the bank will be ready after the summer
holidays, Montebourg said, according to the newspaper.  Private banks are not “sufficiently interested” in the
real economy, preferring to be active in global markets, and the
“confusion” between the role of savings banks and investment
banks has “many adverse effects,” Montebourg said, according
to Le Parisien.  Montebourg said it’s “absurd” that banks post “indecent
margins at the cost of crushing our industrial economy,” and
setting profit margins at 15 percent enters the realm of
“unscrupulousness and indecency,” the paper wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
