Delek Group Ltd. (DLEKG) , controlled by
billionaire Isaac Tshuva, surged the most in more than a month
after the company filed an offer to purchase shares it doesn’t
already own in Delek Energy Systems Ltd.  The  shares  rose 5.3 percent, the most since May 31 in
intraday trade, to 599.8 shekels at 2:12 p.m. in Tel Aviv. Delek
Energy advanced 3.3 percent to 1,374 shekels. Delek Group has an
87.6 percent stake in Delek Energy, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Delek Group is offering to buy shares in Delek Energy in
exchange for units. Each unit will consist of 28  Delek Drilling-
LP (DEDRL)  shares, 431  Avner Oil Exploration LLP (AVNRL)  shares, and 70.4
shekels cash, according to a filing with the  Tel-Aviv  Stock
Exchange today.  “The transaction reflects a market price for Delek Energy
and simplifies the structure of Delek Group,” Eran Yunger, an
analyst at Migdal Capital Markets said today by phone.  On August 3, Delek Group offered to exchange units
consisting of shares of Avner and Delek Drilling for 1 million
shares of Delek Energy, and in September it said it bought all
of the 353,988 shares tendered.  “In the past Delek Group tried to delist Delek Energy but
failed,”  Zach Herzog, the Tel-Aviv based head of international
sales at Psagot House Investment Ltd., said today by phone. “If
the delisting goes through, the simplified corporate structure
may encourage foreign investors to look more closely at Delek
Group and the partnerships, Avner and Delek Drilling,”  Delek Drilling  advanced  2.5 percent to 12.10 shekels while
Avner  gained  1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
