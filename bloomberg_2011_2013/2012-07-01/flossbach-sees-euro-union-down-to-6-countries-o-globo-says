Bert Flossbach, chief executive
officer of German asset-management firm  Flossbach von Storch AG ,
sees the euro monetary union reduced to six countries in Central
Europe,  O Globo  newspaper reported, citing an interview.  Greece, Portugal, Cyprus will be the first countries to
leave the bloc, he said, adding that Italy’s and Spain’s
economic situations also raise concerns.  Greece won’t be able to pay back the amount of credit
granted by the European Central Bank during the crisis and the
market will see its exit out of the bloc with relief, Flossbach
is quoted as saying.  The European Union will have to financially help the
Italian and Spanish banks, otherwise the effect of the crisis
would contaminate other banks in an “unthinkable disaster,”
Flossbach is quoted as telling  O Globo .  The article didn’t list the six nations Flossbach saw
maintaining the euro currency, though they will be “culturally
and economically homogeneous,” he told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
