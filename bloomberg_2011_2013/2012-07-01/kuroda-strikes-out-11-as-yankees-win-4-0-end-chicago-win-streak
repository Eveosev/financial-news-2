Hiroki Kuroda struck out 11 in seven
innings to help the  New York Yankees  end the Chicago White Sox’s
four-game winning streak with a 4-0 victory in a Major League
Baseball contest.  Kuroda improved his record to 8-7 as he allowed three hits
and no runs yesterday at Yankee Stadium.  “I was trying to be too careful, too perfect,” Kuroda
told reporters, speaking about his earlier struggles through a
translator. “Now I try to be as aggressive as possible.”  Kuroda, 37, who joined the Yankees this season from the  Los
Angeles Dodgers , gave up only one walk in the game.  “I think the whole game he was in control,” White Sox
manager Robin Ventura said. “He just never really gave anybody
a good pitch to hit in a hitter’s count.”  Curtis Granderson  hit his 23rd home run of the season in
the first inning, Dewayne Wise hit a run-scoring double in the
second followed by a home run in the fifth to give the Yankees a
3-0 advantage.  Robinson Cano  capped the scoring with his 19th
home run of the season in the sixth inning.  Jake Peavy (6-5) also struck out 11, while allowing four
runs on eight hits in an eight-inning complete game.  “I felt like I made a lot of good pitches,” Peavy said.
“Obviously not enough. The Yankees are always going to do that
to you.”  The Yankees (47-30) are atop the five-team American League
East, five games ahead of the  Baltimore Orioles . The White Sox
(42-36) lead the five-team AL Central division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
