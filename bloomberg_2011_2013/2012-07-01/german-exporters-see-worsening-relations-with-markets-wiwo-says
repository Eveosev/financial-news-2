German exporters are facing worsening
relations with potential buyers in target markets and are being
asked to justify their government’s austerity and reform policy,
WirtschaftsWoche reported, citing Anton Boerner, the president
of Germany’s BGA exporters group.  The  euro zone  needs to clarify after summer recess whether
countries in crisis are willing to carry out necessary reforms,
as otherwise the market would force a decision before the end of
the year, Boerner was cited as saying. If countries want to keep
the euro but aren’t capable of enacting reforms, budget
sovereignty needs to be transferred to European level, he said
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
