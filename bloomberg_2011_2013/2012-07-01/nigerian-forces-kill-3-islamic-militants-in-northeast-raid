     July 1 (Bloomberg)-- Nigerian security forces killed at
least three gunmen suspected of belonging to the Islamic
militant sect Boko Haram during a gunfight yesterday in the
northeastern state of Yobe, police said.  “There was an exchange of gunshots between security
operatives and suspected members of the Boko Haram, and three of
them were shot dead during the attack,” Patrick Egbuniwe, the
Yobe state police commissioner, said by phone today from
Damaturu, the capital. Calm has returned to the town after
police recovered some arms from the area, Egbuniwe said.  Authorities in  Nigeria ,  Africa ’s top oil producer, blame
Boko Haram, which wants to impose strict Islamic law in the
country, for attacks in the mainly Muslim north and Abuja that
have killed hundreds of people this year.  Boko Haram began its violent campaign in 2009 in Africa’s
most populous nation, which is roughly split between a mainly
Muslim north and predominantly Christian south.  To contact the reporter on this story:
