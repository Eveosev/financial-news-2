Pacific Investment Management Co.
expects Germany to lose its status as a safe haven and has
reduced the amount of the country’s sovereign debt it holds,
 WirtschaftsWoche  reported, citing  Andrew Bosomworth , who leads
Pimco’s operations in the country.  Germany will have to pay whether the  euro zone  survives the
debt crisis or not, either in contributions to rescue funds and
joint debt liability or to reduce the impact of an ensuing
recession and to rescue lenders, the German publication cited
Bosomworth as saying.  Pimco has switched its focus to bonds from the US, the U.K.
and Scandinavia, Bosomworth was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
