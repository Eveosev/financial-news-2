Slovakia’s Peter Sagan won today’s
first stage of the 99th Tour de  France .  The Liquigas team rider won in a sprint finish after a 198-
kilometer (123-mile) stage from Liege to Seraing in  Belgium ,
over a flat terrain that ended in an uphill stretch.  Sagan finished ahead of Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland
and Norway’s Edvald Boasson Hagen. Cancellara, who won
yesterday’s opening prologue, a 6.4-kilometer time trial around
Liege, keeps the overall race lead.  Britain’s Bradley Wiggins of the Sky team, the bookmakers’
race favorite, is second overall, seven seconds behind
Cancellara.  Tomorrow’s stage is a 207-kilometer trip from Vise to
Tournai on the France-Belgium border.  The 3,497-kilometer race ends on the Champs-Elysees in
Paris on July 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
