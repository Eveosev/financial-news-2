Arsenalâ€™s  England  forward Theo Walcott is a target for Chelsea and Paris Saint-Germain, the
Sunday Mirror  reported .  The 23-year-old has one year remaining on his contract and
is yet to agree to a new deal, the newspaper said. Arsenal may
consider an offer of 15 million pounds ($23.6 million) rather
than lose him on a free transfer at the end of next season, the
Mirror added.  Walcott earns about 65,000 pounds a week and is looking for
wages of 100,000 pounds a week, the Mirror reported, without
saying where it got the information.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
