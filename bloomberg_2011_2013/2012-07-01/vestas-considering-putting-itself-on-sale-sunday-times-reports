Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS)  is
considering putting itself up for sale after the company entered
into debt restructuring talks with lenders, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The wind turbine makerâ€™s lenders, which include Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc and HSBC Holdings Plc, have hired Ernst &
Young LLP to advise on negotiations, the newspaper said. Vestas
has debt of more than 2 billion euros ($2.53 billion) and has
hired PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP for advice, the Times said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
