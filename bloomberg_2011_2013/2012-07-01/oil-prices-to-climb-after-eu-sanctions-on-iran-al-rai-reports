Oil prices  may rise after European
Union sanctions on  Iran  came into effect today, Kuwait-based  Al-
Rai  reported, citing Kuwait Petroleum Corp. Chief Executive
Officer Farouk al-Zanki.  The halt in Iranian crude oil exports to the EU may drive
prices up to a range between $90 to $100, al-Zanki said,
according to the newspaper. The market will be “monitored” to
control the price trend which will be between $90 and $95
dollars a barrel, the newspaper quoted al-Zanki as saying.  Saudi, the largest producer in the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, is ready to raise production and
to compensate for the lack of supply, al-Zanki said, adding he
doesn’t expect oil to fall to $80, according to the newspaper.  A price of about $100 a barrell is “appropriate and
comfortable” for  Kuwait  and even helps with executing strategic
projects, al-Zanki is quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
