The outcome of last week’s European
summit threatens  Germany ’s financial stability,  Handelsblatt 
reported, citing Hans-Werner Sinn, the president of the Munich-
based Ifo research institute.  “The German state is being drawn ever deeper into the
southern European crisis, while investors from all over the
world, who have gambled and lost, can now get out of the vortex
at the last minute,” Sinn was cited as saying.  The fiscal pact, which Germany had pushed for, won’t be
taken seriously outside the country, Sinn said, according to
Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
