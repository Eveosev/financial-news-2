Sulzer AG (SUN)  is seeking acquisitions and
could spend as much as 1 billion francs ($1 billion),
 SonntagsZeitung  reported, citing an interview with Chief
Executive Officer Klaus Stahlmann.  Sulzer has gaps in its range of pumps for the oil and gas
industry as well as in water and wastewater technology, the
Swiss newspaper cited Stahlmann as saying.  Sulzer could also expand its petrochemicals services and
components businesses geographically, Stahlmann was quoted as
saying by the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
