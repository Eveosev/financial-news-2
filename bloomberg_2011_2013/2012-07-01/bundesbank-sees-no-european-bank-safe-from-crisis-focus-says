Bundesbank Vice President Sabine
Lautenschlaeger said “no European bank is safe from
considerable losses” if the region’s sovereign-debt crisis
worsens,  Focus  magazine reported, citing an interview.  German banks are better prepared than three years ago,
though they are still susceptible to the crisis, the publication
cited Lautenschlaeger as saying.  There are currently no signs that investors are moving
capital out of  Germany  because the country continues to be seen
as a “safe haven,” Lautenschlaeger was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
