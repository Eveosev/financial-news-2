German municipalities and city-states
earned 9.9 billion euros ($12.5 billion) in excise taxes in the
first quarter, 44 million euros more than in the same period
last year,  Handelsblatt  reported, citing data from the Federal
Statistics Office.  The Association of German Cities and Towns had earlier
estimated a “significant” decline in tax revenue, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
