French Productive Recovery Minister
 Arnaud Montebourg  asked  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  to disclose any
plans for plant closures as soon as possible, amid speculation
the carmaker may decide to shut down several sites.  “These leaks, rumors or informations are causing concern
for thousands of workers and families,” Montebourg wrote in the
letter to PSA Chairman Philippe Varin dated June 29, according
to a copy e-mailed by the ministry yesterday. “It would be
essential to provide all the necessary transparency.”  The decisions that PSA Peugeot Citroen might take would
“inevitably” have consequences for all of the car industry,
particularly sub-contractors, Montebourg wrote in the letter. He
asked management to disclose its intentions as soon as possible
and in a precise manner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
