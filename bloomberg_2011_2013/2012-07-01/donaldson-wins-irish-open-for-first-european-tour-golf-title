Welshman Jamie Donaldson hit a final-
round 6-under-par 66 to win golf’s Irish Open for his first
title on the European Tour.  The 36-year-old finished on 18-under in Portrush, County
Antrim, four shots ahead of Spain’s Rafael Cabrera-Bello,
Paraguay’s Fabrizio Zanotti and Anthony Wall of England.  Sweden’s Mikael Lundberg was another shot back, along with
England’s Mark Foster, after a 7-under round.  Donaldson collects a check for 333,330 euros ($422,300),
the biggest prize of his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
