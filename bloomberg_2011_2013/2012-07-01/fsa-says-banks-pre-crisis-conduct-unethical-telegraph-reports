Banks had unethical conduct in the
years before the crisis, according to Martin Wheatley, head of
financial conduct at the Financial Services Authority, the
Sunday Telegraph reported.  The banks “suspended normal ethical standards and were
sellling products that were profitable for the investment
banks,” Wheatley told the U.K. newspaper. The products were
“not well understood by the banking staff that were introducing
them, and not at all understood by customers who were buying
them.”  Wheatley will be in charge of one of the FSA’s two
successor organizations next year, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
