Gold Fields Ltd., (GFI)  the fourth-largest
producer of the metal, closed its Kloof-Driefontein Complex mine
west of Johannesburg after five miners died in an accident.  Another 14 miners were admitted to hospital after a fire
broke out at the mine’s No. 4 shaft, Johannesburg-based Gold
Fields Ltd. said in an e-mailed statement. The mine will remain
closed “until further notice,” it said.  “Management deeply regrets the incident and has launched a
full investigation,” Gold Fields said. “The Department of
Mineral Resources and union representatives have been
informed.”  Kloof-Driefontein Complex is Gold Fields’s the largest
mining operation. In April last year, a shaft at the Driefontein
mine complex was closed for a week after two workers died in
accident.  To contact the reporter on this story:
