Allot Communications Ltd. (ALLT) , the
Israeli company whose technology is used to manage traffic on
networks, posted the longest winning streak since 2010 on
prospects soaring data usage will boost demand for its products.  Shares of the Hod Hasharon, Israel-based company rallied
for a sixth week, the longest string of advances since September
2010.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX) , the maker of technology used
to transfer and store data quickly, added 2.2 percent last week,
extending a record 69 percent for the three months ended June
29. The  Bloomberg Israel-US Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the most traded
Israeli companies in the U.S. declined 8.7 percent to 82.03 last
quarter, led by  Internet Gold-Golden Lines Ltd. (IGLD)   Data usage on mobile phones, tablets and computers more
than doubled globally last year as consumers watched more video
and downloaded more files, boosting global traffic, according to
data compiled by  Cisco (CSCO)  Systems Inc. Allot will probably post a
32 percent sales gain in the second quarter after  revenue  rose
to a  record  $24 million in the first three months of the year,
according to the mean estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “Allot is in a sweet spot because they provide a gateway
that helps operators deliver content and manage traffic,”
Matthew Robison, an analyst at Wunderlich Securities Inc., said
by phone from San Francisco on June 29. “The demand has been
relatively strong even in a difficult economy. That’s why
investors like it.”  Israel ’s  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  climbed 2.3 percent at 1,082.29 at the
close in Tel Aviv, trimming this year’s decline to 0.3 percent.
The Israel-US Equity Index gained 0.1 percent in New York last
week, paring its three-month loss.  ‘No. 1 Problem’  Allot rose 4 percent to $27.86 in New York last week,
sending valuations to 68 times reported earnings, more than four
times the average multiple of 16 for companies traded on the
 Nasdaq Composite Index. (CCMP)  The stock traded at a premium of $1.26
versus the Tel Aviv shares, the widest gap since May 29.  The company’s shares rallied 6 percent to 110.2 shekels, or
$28.18, in Tel Aviv today, after advancing 24 percent for the
three months ended June 28.  By 2016, the number of mobile Internet-connected devices is
expected to surpass 10 billion with mobile data traffic reaching
10.8 exabytes per month, according to a February report by
Cisco, a networking equipment maker.  “The No. 1 problem for mobile carriers right now is
traffic because traffic on networks creates problems in quality
of service,” Sanjit Singh, a New York-based analyst at Wedbush
Securities Inc., said by phone on June 29. “Allot plays right
into that space and should continue seeing waves of new activity
that allow it to grow.”  ‘Increased Momentum’  Allot will probably say revenue grew to $25 million in the
second quarter, up from $19 million in the year-earlier period,
according to the mean  estimate  of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  The company’s first-quarter revenue  surprised  34 percent of
investors, the most since August 2010, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Sales in  Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa  accounted for
73 percent of revenue in the first three months of the year, and
14 percent from the Americas, Nachum Falek, chief financial
officer of Allot, said in a May 1 earnings call.  Allot is seeing “increased momentum in the Americas,”
with carrier deals in  North America  and Latin America, Falek
said during the call.  Mellanox Surges  Mellanox gained to $70.82 in New York in the quarter ending
June 29. The Tel Aviv stock rose 2.5 percent to 275.7 shekels,
the equivalent of $70.51, today. The Yokneam Elit, Israel-based

results  surprised  51 percent of analysts, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Internet Gold, the company which owns a stake in Bezeq
Israeli Telecommunication Corp. via its  B Communications Ltd. (BCOM) 
unit, tumbled 59 percent to $2.84 in New York during the second
quarter, the biggest  three-month  slide since December 2008.  The shares tumbled 58 percent to 10.68 shekels, or $2.73,
in Tel Aviv in the three months ended June 28, its sixth
consecutive quarterly loss. The stock rose 4.9 percent today.  Cellcom Israel Ltd. (CEL)  and Partner Communications Co.,
Israel’s largest mobile-service providers, tumbled at least 47
percent as competition in the telecommunications industry
intensified after the government forced providers to cut fees
and encouraged new players to enter the market.  Israel, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in size
to Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies traded on the Nasdaq
Stock Market, the most of any country outside the U.S. after
 China . The nation is also home to more startup companies per
capita than the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
