Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
rose as the yen weakened and Spanish and Italian bonds surged
after European leaders expanded steps to stem the region’s debt
crisis.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , a Japanese
camera maker that depends on Europe for almost a third of its
sales, gained 0.8 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo.
ADRs of  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets almost 40 percent
of its revenue from  North America , rose 0.7 percent after an
index of U.S. business activity unexpectedly accelerated. Those
of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s biggest oil producer, advanced
1.4 percent after crude prices jumped the most in more than
three years.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,105 in Chicago on June 29, up from 9,010
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,100 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index rose
0.9 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index advanced 0.6
percent in Wellington.  “The euro strengthened and Spanish yields plunged.
Investors are now in a situation to take risks,” said  Hideyuki Ishiguro , assistant manager of investment strategy at Okasan
Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The European Central Bank may lower
interest rates this week.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 0.2
percent today. The gauge jumped 2.5 percent, the most in 2012,
in New York on June 29 after European leaders agreed to relax
conditions on emergency loans for Spanish banks and possible
help for Italy as an outflanked German  Chancellor Angela Merkel 
gave in on expanded steps to stem the region’s debt crisis.  Bonds Surge  Spain’s Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said on July 1 a
swift adoption of decisions to foster a banking, fiscal and
political union made at last week’s European Summit would help
reduce the country’s borrowing costs.  Spain’s 10-year yield fell the most since August, and
Italy’s 10-year yield fell to 5.8 percent on June 29.  Economists expect the  European Central Bank  will lower its
benchmark  interest rate  by at least 25 basis points to a record
low of 0.75 percent on July 5, according to the median of 57
estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  The yen depreciated to as low as 101.30 against the euro
today in Tokyo, compared with 99.96 at the close of  stock
trading  on June 29. Against the dollar, Japan’s currency
weakened to 79.93 from 79.37. A weaker yen boosts the value of
overseas income at Japanese companies when converted into their
home currency.  Oil Jumps  In the U.S., an index of business activity unexpectedly
expanded in June at a faster pace. Other reports showed  consumer
spending  stalled in May, while household sentiment dropped in
June to the lowest level of the year.  Crude oil for August delivery soared 9.4 percent to $84.96
a barrel in New York on June 29, the biggest gain since March
2009. The London Metal Exchange Index of prices for six
industrial metals including copper and aluminum gained 3.9
percent, the biggest increase since Nov. 30.  The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded Chinese
equities in the U.S gained 2.9 percent to 91.21 in New York on
June 29, the biggest advance since May 29.  In China, the  Purchasing Managers ’ Index fell to 50.2 in
June from 50.4 in May, the Beijing-based National Bureau of
Statistics and China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing
said. That beat the 49.9 median estimate in a Bloomberg News
survey of 24 economists. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Monetary Policy  “The Chinese PMI isn’t bad as much as expected. The
decline may help expectations for easing monetary policies to be
continued,” said Okasan Securities’ Ishiguro.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed 3 percent this year
through June 29, compared with an 8.3 percent advance by the  S&P
500  and a 2.7 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 12 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13.1 times for the S&P 500
and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  In Japan, the government is scheduled to release its
quarterly Tankan index of sentiment among the nation’s largest
manufacturers at 8:50 a.m. in Tokyo.  To contact the reporters on this story:
