Softbank Corp. (9984) ,  Japan ’s third-largest
mobile phone company, said it will build the nation’s biggest
solar plant as the country begins an incentive program for clean
energy.  The facility in Tomakomai, Hokkaido will start operations
in fiscal 2014 and have the capacity of 111 megawatts, Softbank
spokesman Naoki Nakayama said today in a telephone interview.  The Tokyo-based company held a ceremony today to mark the
start of operations at a 2.1-megawatt solar plant in Kyoto,
Nakayama said. The carrier also announced plans to build solar
plants in Tottori, Nagasaki and Kumamoto prefectures as well as
a wind power power plant in Shimane prefecture, he said.  Under the incentive plan, Japan’s utilities are required to
buy electricity from renewable sources such as solar, wind and
geothermal at above-market rates to increase the country’s clean
power use and diversify its energy mix. Softbank’s Chairman
Masayoshi Son has set up SB Energy Corp. to develop and promote
 renewable energy projects  since the Fukushima nuclear disaster.  A 2.4-megawatt solar plant also began operating today in
Gunma prefecture, according to a release by SB Energy.  Toshiba Corp. (6502)  announced June 20 it reached an agreement
with the quake-hit city of Minamisoma in Fukushima prefecture to
build solar power stations totaling 100 megawatts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
