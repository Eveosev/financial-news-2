The South African Football
Association appointed Gordon Igesund as the national soccer team
coach, according to a statement on its website today.  Igesund replaces Pitso Mosemane, who was fired on June 5
after the nation drew 1-1 at home against Ethiopia in the
opening match of its campaign to qualify for the 2014  World Cup .  Igesund, 55, guided Moroka Swallows to second place in
 South Africa ’s Professional Soccer League this year after
helping them escape relegation in 2011. He has won four PSL
titles with four different clubs.  He was offered a two-year contract with a mandate to reach
at least the semi-final of the African Nations Cup tournament,
which South Africa will host in 2013, as well as qualifying the
country for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil, SAFA said after
hearing presentations from Igesund and Steve Komphela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
