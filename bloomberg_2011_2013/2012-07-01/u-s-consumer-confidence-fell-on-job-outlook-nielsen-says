U.S.  consumer confidence  fell in the
second quarter of 2012 on concern for the economy and  job
security , according to a survey by  Nielsen Holdings NV. (NLSN)   Nielsen, a global information and measurement company, said
its index of U.S. consumer confidence fell five points in the
period to 87. Its lowest point on record was 80 points in the
first half of 2009. The company surveyed 500 people in the U.S.
online from May 4 to May 21.  The top concern for U.S. consumers was the economy, with 42
percent citing it as their main worry. Concern for job security
also increased from 18 to 22 percent. Concerns for debt, rising
fuel and food prices decreased, the survey said.  “Given the dramatic slowdown in hiring which has been
steadily falling since January, consumers are concerned that the
economy is stalling again,” said James Russo, the vice
president of Global Consumer Insights at Nielsen.  One in three respondents said they were optimistic for job
prospects in the next six months, one in two were confident for
personal finances, and one in three said it was a good time to
buy things they want and need, according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
