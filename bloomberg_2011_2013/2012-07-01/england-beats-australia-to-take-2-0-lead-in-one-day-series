England beat Australia by six wickets in the second one-day
cricket international to take a 2-0 lead in the best-of-five
series.  England restricted the tourists to 251-7 at the Oval in
London, then reached its victory target with more than four
overs to spare. Ian Bell made 75 in England’s 252-4.  The hosts will replace Australia atop the International
Cricket Council’s one-day rankings by sweeping the series. That
would make England the first country to be No. 1 in all three
forms of the game as it currently tops the Test and Twenty20
ratings.  Eoin Morgan hit the winning runs to finish unbeaten on 43.
He’d cracked 89 not out in the 15-run victory in the opening
game at Lord’s in London on June 29.  Earlier,  Shane Watson  hit 66 and George Bailey 65 for
Australia, while Brett Lee struck 20 from 11 balls at the end of
the innings.  Tim Bresnan  took two wickets.  The next match is on July 4 at Edgbaston in Birmingham.  To contact the reporter on this story:
