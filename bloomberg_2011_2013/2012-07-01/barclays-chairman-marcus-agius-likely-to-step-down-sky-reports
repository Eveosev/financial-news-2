Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chairman Marcus Agius is
likely to step down as soon as tomorrow following the British
lender’s involvement in the manipulation of the Libor lending
rate, Sky News reported today, citing unidentified individuals.  Agius probably would be replaced by Michael Rake, Sky said.  The decision on Agius’s future will be taken at a Barclays
board meeting, Sky said.  Were Agius to step down, it’s unlikely Chief Executive
Officer  Bob Diamond  would depart, Sky said, in part because
regulators wouldn’t allow a bank as systemically important as
Barclays to lose both its chairman and chief executive
simultaneously.  To contact the reporter on this story:
