Taiwan will allow local companies to
issue bonds denominated in Chinese  yuan  in order to provide them
further sources of funds, the Financial Supervisory Commission
said in a statement on its website yesterday.  Bonds would be issued in  Hong Kong  or through overseas
banking units, the statement said. The regulator also plans to
ease restrictions on Taiwanese asset managersâ€™ investments in
Chinese securities and allow local financial institutions to
offer yuan-based products such as deposits and remittances, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
