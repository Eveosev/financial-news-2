Commissioner Neelie Kroes plans to eliminate the difference in
costs between using mobile phones domestically and between
nations in the bloc by 2015,  Focus  magazine reported, citing an
interview.  Kroes also said the Commission is exploring how the
 European Investment Bank  may support investments by phone
companies in broadband networks, according to the German
magazine. Such an expansion would cost 160 billion euros ($203
billion) to 250 billion euros, Kroes was cited as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
