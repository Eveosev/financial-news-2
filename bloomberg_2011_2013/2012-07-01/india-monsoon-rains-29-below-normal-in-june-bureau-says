India ’s monsoon rainfall, which
accounts for 70 percent of the nation’s total rains, was 29
percent below normal in June, the weather office said.  The country received 115.5 millimeters (4.55 inches) of
rain last month, the  India Meteorological Department   said  on its
website. That’s less than the 163.5 millimeters average
considered normal for the period, it said.  Showers in June, which account for 18 percent of season’s
total, have been the least since 2009 when they were 47.2
percent below a 50-year average, according to the weather
office. Rains were 12.2 percent more than the average in June
last year while falls were 15.6 percent below normal in the same
month in 2010.  Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  is counting on good rains to
boost growth in farm output, which accounts for about 15 percent
of gross domestic product, to curb higher inflation.  Rains made a slow start this year, reaching the southern
state of Kerala four days later than the normal June 1. Sowing
of summer crops such as rice and oilseeds has been delayed after
rain was either late or less than adequate in the main growing
regions.  Monsoon rainfall during the June-September season will be
normal for the third year, the weather office said on June 22.
Rainfall will be 96 percent of the average during the four
months, it said. That compares with 99 percent predicted by it
in April.  To contact the reporters on this story:
