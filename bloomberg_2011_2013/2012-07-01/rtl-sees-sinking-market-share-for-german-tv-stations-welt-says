Officer Anke Schaeferkordt said she expects large German
television broadcasters to lose market share as the TV industry

interview.  Still, RTL plans to retain its leadership in  Germany  and
wants to maintain a “decent” distance to rivals, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
