South  Korea ’s inflation moderated in
June on falling  oil prices  and the government expanding free
school lunch and child care programs, giving the central bank
more leeway to forgo raising borrowing costs.  Consumer prices increased 2.2 percent from a year earlier
after a 2.5 percent gain in May, Statistics Korea said today in
Gwacheon, south of Seoul. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey of 12 economists was for a 2.5 percent gain. Prices
fell 0.1 percent from May.  The  Finance Ministry  on June 28 lowered its forecasts for
inflation and economic growth for this year, citing the  European
debt crisis  as a “long-term threat.” The  Bank of Korea , which
targets inflation at between 2 percent and 4 percent, will
determine borrowing costs on July 12.  “Inflation is going to decelerate for months to come,”
said Lim Ji Won, an economist at JPMorgan Chase & Co. in Seoul.
“Prices of manufactured goods have been falling with oil prices
so this is being reflected in June.”  The won rose for a fifth day, reaching its highest level in
almost eight weeks, gaining 0.2 percent to 1,142.91 per dollar
as of 9:22 a.m. in  Seoul , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It touched 1,139.50 earlier, the strongest since May
9. The Kospi stock index rose 0.1 percent.  Core consumer prices, which exclude oil and agricultural
products, advanced 1.5 percent in June from a year earlier.  Slower Growth  Gross domestic product may expand 3.3 percent this year,
less than a December estimate of 3.7 percent, the Finance
Ministry said June 28. Inflation this year may be 2.8 percent
rather than a past 3.2 percent prediction, it said.  South Korea’s exports rose in June, snapping three months
of declines, after a weaker won fueled overseas sales, according
to a separate report yesterday. Overseas  shipments  rose 1.3
percent from a year earlier, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy 
said, after a revised 0.6 percent decline in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
