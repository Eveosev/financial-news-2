Shane Watson and George Bailey scored
half-centuries as Australia posted 251-7 from its 50 overs in
today’s second one-day cricket international against England at
the Oval in London.  Watson top-scored with 66, Bailey made 65, while Brett Lee
cracked 20 from 11 balls at the end of the innings.  Tim Bresnan 
took two wickets.  England defeated Australia by 15 runs in the opening game
of the five-match series at Lord’s in London on June 29.   England  will replace  Australia atop the International
Cricket Council’s one-day rankings by sweeping the series. That
would make it the first country to be No. 1 in all three forms
of the game as it currently tops the Test and Twenty20 ratings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
