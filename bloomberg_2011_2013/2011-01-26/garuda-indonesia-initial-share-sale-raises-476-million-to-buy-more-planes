PT Garuda  Indonesia , the flag
carrier that raised $530 million in a January initial public
offering, may buy 18 planes with fewer than 100 seats to expand
services to areas without airports for larger aircraft.  Garuda plans to buy the planes by 2015 with delivery
starting next year, Elisa Lumbantoruan, the airline’s finance
director, said in Jakarta today. A request for proposals will be
issued next month and announcement on the tender is expected in
June, he said, without naming prospective suppliers.  “We want to be able to land on shorter runways,”
Lumbantoruan said at a press briefing. “We want to fly tourists
to regions around Bali.”  Garuda, which today reported net income fell 48 percent in
2010, intends to use the smaller planes to access more domestic
routes among Indonesia’s 17,000 islands that span 3,200 miles
(5,150 kilometers), the distance from  Florida  to  Alaska . The
carrier wants to “bypass” larger  airports  in Jakarta, Surabaya
and Bali’s Denpasar by offering direct flights among smaller
regional airports, Lumbantoruan said.  Capital Spending   Garuda, which raised $4.8 trillion rupiah in an initial
public offering in January, plans $250 million in capital
spending this year, as much as $130 million of which will go to
purchasing new planes, Chief Executive Officer Emirsyah Satar
said. The company also plans to add routes this year to Taipei
and member countries of the  Association of Southeast Asian
Nations , he said.  The carrier also plans to lease six Airbus 320-200s for its
Citilink service this year. The mainline carrier will add two
A330-200s and nine Boeing Co. 737-800 NG in the year,
Lumbantoruan said.  Garuda has pared flights to  Tokyo  as concerns about
radiation leaks at a tsunami-stricken nuclear-power plant north
of the capital and electricity shortages damp  travel demand . The
carrier will combine two separate services to the Japanese
capital from Jakarta and Denpasar into one flight starting April
5 until April 22, Lumbantoruan said.  Garuda dropped 3.6 percent to 530 rupiah as of the 4 p.m.
close of Jakarta trading.  Net income fell to 515.5 billion rupiah ($59 million) from
1 trillion rupiah last year as operating costs increased,
outstripping a 9 percent gain in revenue to 19.5 trillion
rupiah.  Fuel costs will probably rise again this year, Satar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
