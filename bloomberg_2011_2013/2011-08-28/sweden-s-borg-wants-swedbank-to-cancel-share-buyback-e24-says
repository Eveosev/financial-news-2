Swedish Finance Minister Anders Borg
wants  Swedbank AB (SWEDA)  to cancel its share buyback plans,  E24
reported yesterday , citing an interview with the minister.  Borg warned against proceeding with the share buyback,
given the risk of a European banking crisis, the online
newspaper reported.  Under the current circumstances the bank should put its
plans on hold and focus on strengthening its balance sheet, the
minister was quoted as saying. It is very important that banks
are well-capitalized, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
