DZ Bank AG wrote down the value of
its Greece portfolio by 243 million euros ($352 million) in the
first six months of the year,  Die Welt am Sonntag  reported.  The bank used market valuations to determine the size of
the writedown, Die Welt cited Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Kirsch as saying in an interview.  That means the writedown was significantly more than the
expected 21 percent that had been assumed for private creditors,
Kirsh said, Die Welt reported.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
