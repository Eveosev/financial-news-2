Dutch government will offer
additional support to entrepreneurs facing difficulties getting
credit, Economic Affairs Minister Maxime Verhagen said in an
interview with website wwww.nu.nl.  The government can eliminate “cold feet” at banks by
providing security for a portion of the loan, Verhagen said.
“That gives the push to the loan anyway.”  The government will increase the guarantee program for
medium-sized businesses to 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from
765 million euros, Verhagen said.  The guarantee for larger companies, which was established
during the credit crisis in 2008, will be extended with at least
one year. The temporary arrangement was scheduled to be
completed on Jan. 1, 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
