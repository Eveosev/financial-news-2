Bond investors are backing Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s forecast that the U.S. will
avoid another recession.  The economy has never contracted with the difference
between 10- and 30-year Treasury yields as wide as the current
1.34 percentage points, or 134 basis points, since the so-called
long bond was first issued in 1977. The gap, which is more than
double the 49 basis-point average of the past 20 years, has
ranged from negative 56 to positive 41.9 at the start of the
last five recessions, beginning in January 1980.  While reports this month showed manufacturing dropped to a
two-year low and the worst  consumer confidence  since November
2008, investors say the Fed’s pledge to keep  interest rates  near
zero until mid-2013 will underpin growth. The Commerce
Department may say today that personal spending, which accounts
for about 70 percent of the economy, rose 0.5 percent in July,
above the 0.3 percent average since 2000, according to the
median of more than 60 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey.  “There is a lot of fear, but U.S. growth is not dead,”
Andrew Richman, who oversees $10 billion as a strategist in  Palm
Beach ,  Florida , for SunTrust Bank’s private wealth management
division, said in an Aug. 26 interview.  The yield curve, as the gap between short- and long-term
rates is known, shows the market expects the economy will be
strong enough to keep inflation from slowing, “and eventually
Treasury yields will have to rise,” he said.  Jackson Hole  A Commerce Department report on Aug. 26 showed that gross
domestic product grew at a 1 percent annual rate last second
quarter, compared with an initial estimate of 1.3 percent. The
data also showed corporate profits jumped and wages and salaries
were revised up at the start of 2011 for the biggest gain in
more than four years.  “Although important problems certainly exist, the growth
fundamentals of the  United States  do not appear to have been
permanently altered by the shocks of the past four years,”
Bernanke said after the report at a symposium in Jackson Hole,
 Wyoming , hosted by the Federal Reserve Bank of  Kansas City . “It
may take some time, but we can reasonably expect to see a return
to growth rates and employment levels consistent with those
underlying fundamentals.”  Yields on 10-year notes rose last week for the first time
since the period ended July 22, climbing 13 basis points to 2.19
percent in New York, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices.
The benchmark 2.125 percent security due in August 2021 fell 1
4/32, or $11.25 per $1,000 face amount, to 99 13/32. Thirty-year
bond yields jumped 14 basis points to 3.54 percent.  Ten-year rates were 2.27 percent and long bonds yielded
3.62 percent today as of 2:40 p.m. in  New York .  Yield Curve  The relationship between short- and long-term yields is a
closely watched indicator. Three-month bill rates have topped
10-year note yields eight times since 1960, with recessions
following in six of those cases. There hasn’t been a contraction
that wasn’t preceded by an inverted curve in that period.  Typically, longer-term yields exceed short-term ones
because investors demand a higher premium to compensate for the
risk that a growing economy sparks inflation over time.  Because the Fed has pegged rates on short-dated debt near
zero since 2008 and spent $600 billion buying Treasuries due
mainly in less than 10 years between November and the end of
June through its quantitative easing, investors are now looking
at the difference in yields between long maturity bonds,
according to  Carl Riccadonna , a senior economist at Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc. in New York.  ‘Vote of Confidence’  “The U.S. is sick, but not dying,” Riccadonna said in a
phone interview on Aug. 24. The firm’s parent, Deutsche Bank AG,
is one of the 20 primary dealers of U.S. government securities
that trade with the Fed. “The steep curve is a vote of
confidence from the market that, while the near-term outlook
isn’t great, the market doesn’t think we are slipping into
recession, and growth and inflation will pick up.”  Ten-year notes had higher yields than 30-year bonds in
January 2000 before the 2001 recession, and again in January
2006, Bloomberg data show. Growth contracted as much as 8.7
percent at the worst of the recession that began in December
2007 and ended in June 2009.  The difference this year has averaged 118 basis points, the
widest ever, and the most since 98 basis points in 2002,
according to the data. It has averaged 52.8 since the start of
2000.  Unemployment, Confidence  While yields rose last week, they are still at about record
lows, signaling that investors don’t expect strong growth. The
median estimate of 62 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is
for GDP to expand 1.75 percent this year, below the average of
2.59 percent between 2000 and 2007.  Unemployment remains above 9 percent. The  Institute for
Supply Management  in Tempe,  Arizona , said this month that its
manufacturing index slumped to 50.9, the lowest since July 2009,
from 55.3 a month earlier. The Thomson Reuters/University of
Michigan final index of consumer sentiment fell to 55.7 this
month from 63.7 in July.  “My base forecast is that we’ve got a better-than-even
chance that we’ll be sliding into a recession,”  Martin Feldstein , a professor of economics at  Harvard University  in
Cambridge,  Massachusetts , said Aug. 26 in a Bloomberg Television
interview from  Jackson Hole . “I buy that we could easily tip
into recession.”  Target Rate  After pledging to keep its target rate for overnight loans
between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent until mid-2013
and buying $2.3 trillion in government and mortgage-related debt
between December 2008 and this June, there’s little left that
the Fed can do to boost growth, according to Feldstein, a member
of the Business Cycle Dating Committee of the National Bureau of
Economic Research, which determines when recessions start and
end.  For all the concern that the economy is slowing, retail
sales climbed in July by the most in four months, jumping 0.5
percent, the Commerce Department in  Washington  said on Aug. 12.
Orders for durable goods increased 4 percent in July, the most
in four months, a separate Commerce Department report showed.
The median projection of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News called for a 2 percent gain.  Commercial and industrial loans outstanding rose for the
sixth straight week in the period ending Aug. 17, to $1.29
trillion, the highest since December 2009, the Fed said Aug. 26.  ‘Wild Ride’  “It’s been a wild ride, but the market is still betting on
eventual growth rather than a sustained recession,”  Eric Lascelles , the chief economist at Royal Bank of Canada Global
Asset Management, which oversees about $261 billion, said in an
Aug. 22 telephone interview. “There is still a lot of monetary
stimulus out there, and the market knows Bernanke is committed
to low rates for years and the Fed has shown they are willing to
do even more than anyone ever imagined.”  Other bond-market measures show traders expect the economy
to spur inflation.  The five-year, five-year forward breakeven rate, a gauge
the Fed uses to help determine monetary policy because it
projects the pace of price increases starting in 2016, ended
last week at 2.77 percent. The rate has averaged 2.8 percent the
past five years. The cost of living rose at a 1.8 percent annual
pace in July, excluding food and energy costs, the most in more
than a year, the Labor Department said Aug. 18.  Slow, persistent growth will help ease concern that the U.S.
is starting to look like  Japan  in the 1990s, when the  Bank of
Japan  struggled to revive its economy amid a combination of
deflation and recessions, said Brett Rose, interest-rate
strategist in New York at primary dealer Citigroup Global
Markets.  ‘Flight to Quality’  The difference in yields between Japanese 10- and 30-year
bonds was 95 basis points, almost 40 basis points narrower than
in the U.S.  “The steepness of the curve shows that the rally we’ve
seen in Treasuries is one of flight to quality rather than
concerns that we are entering any period of sustained slow
growth,” Rose said Aug. 23. “Growth will continue at a slow
pace. If you really think we are going in the direction of
anything resembling Japan you have to see the full length of the
curve flatten like it did in Japan, and that isn’t happening.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
