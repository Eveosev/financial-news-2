Salam International Investment Ltd.,
a Qatari construction services provider, plans to establish with
other shareholders an investment bank in Lebanon with an initial
$13 million capital, its chief executive officer said.  Salam International will participate in the new bank with
$3 million, Issa Abdul Salam Abu Issa said in a press conference
in Doha today. The Beirut-based lenderâ€™s capital may later be
increased, he said.  Salam International will also invest as much as 10 million
Jordanian dinars ($14 million) for a 13 percent share of a
tourism project in  Jordan , he said. Salam International said in
a statement to the Qatari bourse last month that it had signed
an initial agreement to purchase a stake in Al-Tajamouat for
Touristic Projects Co. of Jordan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
