German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  is
optimistic that the increased euro-region bailout will get
majority approval in the Bundestag,  Bild am Sonntag  reported,
citing an interview.  Merkel rejected euro bonds as a means to tackle the crisis,
saying that wonâ€™t solve the root of the problem, namely the
massive debts, Bild reported.  The chancellor said she believes the government coalition
can survive the legislative period and that it could continue to
work with the FDP party after the general election in 2013, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
