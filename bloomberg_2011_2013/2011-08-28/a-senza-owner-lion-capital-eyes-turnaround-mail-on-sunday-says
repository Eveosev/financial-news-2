La Senza owner  Lion Capital LLP  is
considering restructuring the lingerie retail company by selling
or closing poorly performing stores, the Mail on Sunday
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Lion Capital has already discussed a possible plan with the
restructuring and turnaround adviser Hilco, according to the
report. La Senza has been hurt by leases it acquired as part of
its 2007 merger with the lingerie chain Contessa, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
