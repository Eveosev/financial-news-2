The average price for regular
gasoline at U.S. filling stations was unchanged at $3.6093
a gallon.  The price covers the two-week period ended Aug. 26 and
is derived from a survey of about 2,500 filling stations
nationwide by Camarillo, California-based  Trilby Lundberg .
The average price is about 30 percent above a year earlier,
when the average was $2.7722.  “In the crude oil market, the rebels storming Tripoli
was not a significant price issue,” Lundberg said in a
telephone interview. “In the gasoline retail market, on
average, Irene has not and did not appear in the price.”  Irene, which weakened to a tropical storm earlier
today, may serve as a “negative demand factor” and help
drive down prices at the pump over the next two weeks, she
said.  Gasoline for September delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  rose 11.24 cents, or 4 percent, to
$2.9346 a gallon in the two weeks ended Aug. 26. Futures
are down 15 percent since reaching a 33-month high of
$3.4648 on April 29.  Futures have since declined on indications that the
 U.S. economy  recovery from the worst recession since the
1930s has stalled.  Economic Growth  The U.S. economy grew less than previously estimated
in the second quarter. Gross domestic product climbed at a
1 percent annual rate from April through June, down from a
1.3 percent prior estimate, revised Commerce Department
figures showed on Aug. 26.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment slumped in August to 54.9, the
lowest level since May 1980, from 63.7 the prior month. The
Bloomberg Comfort Index’s monthly expectations gauge
slumped in August to the weakest since March 2009. The
index measures consumer views on the economy, personal
finances and buying climate.  Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on Aug.
26 that the central bank still has tools to stimulate a
recovery that has been weaker than forecast while sticking
to his view that growth will pick up.  Bernanke Speech  Bernanke, in a speech to central bankers and
economists at an annual forum in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming ,
said the recovery is likely to improve in the second half
of this year as he sought to reassure investors and the
public that U.S. growth is safe in the long run and the Fed
can aid the recovery if needed.  The amount of gasoline supplied to the U.S. market by
refiners and blenders fell 2 percent to 9.01 million
barrels a day last week, the lowest level for this time of
year since 2002, according to Energy Department data.
American drivers last week bought 4.2 percent less fuel
than a year earlier,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  said Aug. 23.  U.S. gasoline stockpiles increased 1.36 million
barrels in the week ended Aug. 19 to 211.4 million.  The front-month crude oil contract is little changed,
settling at $85.37 a barrel on Aug. 26, 1 cent lower than
two weeks earlier.  Crude prices may fall this week as Libyan rebels
consolidate their hold on the country after deposing leader
 Muammar Qaddafi  and begin taking steps to restore exports,
a Bloomberg News survey showed.  Analyst Forecasts  Seventeen of 34 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast oil
will decline through Sept. 2. Nine respondents, or 26
percent, predicted prices will increase and eight estimated
there will be little change during the period. Last week 42
percent of surveyed analysts projected a decline.  Crude oil supplies fell 2.21 million barrels to
351.8 million in the period ended Aug. 19, the biggest drop
since December. Inventories at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for New York-traded West Texas Intermediate
oil, fell 0.1 percent to 33.7 million, a nine-month low.  On  Long Island , regular gasoline averaged $3.88 a
gallon, Lundberg said. Los Angeles-area retail stations
averaged $3.72 a gallon.  The highest price in the lower 48 U.S. states among
the cities surveyed on Aug. 26 was in  Chicago  with $4.02 a
gallon. The lowest price was in Tucson, where a gallon
averaged $3.26, Lundberg said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
