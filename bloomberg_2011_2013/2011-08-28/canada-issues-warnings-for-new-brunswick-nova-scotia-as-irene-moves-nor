The Canadian Hurricane Centre issued
warnings for  New Brunswick  and Nova Scotia as Tropical Storm
Irene makes its way north along eastern  North America .  The storm is expected to reach Canada tonight, bringing
high winds, heavy rain and possibly storm surges to the maritime
provinces, the agency said on its website. Quebec’s eastern
townships about 200 kilometers from Montreal and the St.
Lawrence River Valley may get winds as high as 120 kilometers
(75 miles) an hour.  Irene was 10 miles west of Danbury,  Connecticut , with winds
of 60 miles per hour and moving north-northeast at 26 miles an
hour as of 11 a.m., the U.S. National Hurricane Center said. The
storm has killed 11 people and knocked out power to more than
4 million in 12 states.  Irene was a shadow of the storm that roared across the
Caribbean with winds of up to 120 miles (194 kilometers) an hour
and crashed into  North Carolina ’s Outer Banks as a Category 1
hurricane. It dropped to tropical storm status before reaching
New York City at about 9 a.m. today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
