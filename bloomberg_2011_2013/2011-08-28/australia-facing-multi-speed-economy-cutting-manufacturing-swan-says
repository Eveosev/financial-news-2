Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan
said the nation is facing a “multi-speed” economy with the
mining industry growing strongly while a high local currency
pressures manufacturers. Manufacturing output will increase by
around 5 percent in the period to 2020, compared with 77
percent for the resources industry, Swan said in a weekly
economic note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
