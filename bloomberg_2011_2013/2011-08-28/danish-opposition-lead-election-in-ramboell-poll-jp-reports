Denmarkâ€™s opposition bloc led the
Liberal-Conservative government and its allies in a Ramboell
poll published today by  Jyllands-Posten .  The opposition, led by Social Democrat Helle Thorning- Schmidt, has 53.8 percent voter backing, versus 46.1 percent
support for the ruling coalition, the poll showed.  Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen called an early
election on Aug. 26 after failing to secure majority lawmaker
backing for his economic stimulus package. Danes go to the polls
on Sept. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
