JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the second-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, said its New York headquarters
escaped serious damage and that the company is using a hotline
to help communicate with employees.  “All branch managers are calling employees one-by-one to
see if they’re okay,”  Kristin Lemkau , a spokeswoman for the New
York-based lender, said today in an e-mail. “As soon as mass
transit is up and running and we know they can get to work
safely, we’ll update the message that it’s business-as-usual
tomorrow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
