Denmark’s Conservative People’s
Party and the Social Liberals formed a political alliance ahead
of the country’s Sept. 15 parliamentary elections,  Berlingske
reported late  yesterday, citing both party leaders, Lars Barfoed
and Margrethe Vestager.  The two parties pledged to work together no matter which
political bloc wins the election, according to the Copenhagen-
based newspaper.  Denmark’s Prime Minister Lars Loekke Rasmussen on Aug. 26
called an early election after failing to secure majority
lawmaker backing for his economic stimulus package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
