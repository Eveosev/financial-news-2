Irelandâ€™s central bank will publish
figures this week showing that cases of home mortgages more than
90 days in arrears rose to about 7 percent of the total at the
end of June, the  Sunday Business Post  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  Some 6.3 percent of mortgages were at least 90 days behind
in payments at the end of March, the Dublin-based bank  said  on
May 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
