Arsenal will this week sign defender
 Gary Cahill  from Bolton, even after an argument between the
Premier League soccer clubs over his valuation,  the Sunday
Mirror reported .  Arsenal will make a new 12 million-pound ($19.6 million)
bid, rising to a potential 15 million pounds, the newspaper
said, without citing anyone.  Bolton claimed Arsenal offered only 6 million pounds for
the 25-year-old England center-back, while Gunners manager
 Arsene Wenger  said his club had offered more, the Mirror
reported.  The Gunners are also set to sign South Korea captain Park
Chu-Young for 10 million pounds from  Monaco , while Rennes
midfielder Yann Mâ€™Vila is to join for a similar fee, the Mirror
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
