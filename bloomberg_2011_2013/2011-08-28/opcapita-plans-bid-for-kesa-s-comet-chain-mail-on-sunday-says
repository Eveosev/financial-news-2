Private-equity company OpCapita is
planning a “knockout” bid for Comet, the electrical goods
chain owned by  France ’s  Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) , the Mail on Sunday
reported, without saying where it got the information.  OpCapita’s offer for the 249-store retailer will likely be
made in early September, the newspaper said. Kesa put Comet up
for sale in June, after the chain posted a loss of 8.9 million
pounds ($14.6 million) for the year ended April 30, according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
