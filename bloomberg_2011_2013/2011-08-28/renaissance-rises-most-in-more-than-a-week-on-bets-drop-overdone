Renaissance Services SAOG (RNSS)  surged the
most in more than a week amid investor speculation this month’s
losses related to a fraud case have been overdone given earnings
prospects.  The shares advanced 7.7 percent, the most since Aug. 18, to
0.658 rial at the 1 p.m. close in Muscat, trimming this month’s
decline to 18 percent. The benchmark MSM30 Index climbed 2.1
percent to 5,702.51  “Long- to medium-term investors are probably buying at
these levels expecting improved performance in the upcoming
year,” said Kanaga Sundar, head of research at Gulf Baader
Capital Markets Co. in Muscat. “We do expect earnings to come
under pressure this year, but the performance will improve next
year.”  Renaissance may report a profit of 30.5 million rials ($79
million) in 2012, up from a projected 16.7 million rials this
year, according to the mean estimate of five analysts on
Bloomberg. BankMuscat SAOG maintained a “buy” recommendation
on Renaissance on Aug. 25, with a share-price estimate of 0.91
rial.  The company said Aug. 18 it was confident that the only
fraud incident is one of $2.9 million involving a junior manager
at the Topaz Group unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
