Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania are
prepared to handle a deteriorating economy in the European Union
because they cut the size of their budget deficits, Estonian
Prime Minister  Andrus Ansip  said.  “All the Baltic states, not only Estonia, are pretty well
prepared for every type of crisis,” said Ansip in a press
conference in the Latvian capital Riga today, with Latvian Prime
Minister Valdis Dombrovskis and Lithuanian Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius.  The Baltic countries cut spending and raised taxes
beginning in 2008 to slash budget deficits after a real estate-
fueled boom-turned-bust. Latvia’s deficit is expected to fall to
about 3.8 percent of gross domestic product this year from 7.7
percent of GDP last year, Ansip said, citing a conversation he
had with Dombrovskis.  Estonia, which had a  budget surplus  last year, plans
another surplus this year, he said.  Austerity measures adopted in the Baltics, which suffered
the EU’s deepest recessions in 2009, are a lesson for the
European periphery as it struggles through a sovereign-debt
crisis,  Fitch Ratings  said on Aug. 25.  Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia “have shown that although it
was painful to correct large macroeconomic imbalances and return
to growth with a fixed-euro exchange regime, it was not
impossible,” said Michele Napolitano, associate director on
Fitch’s sovereign team, in a report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
