At least 20 people were killed by
flooding in the southwestern city of Ibadan,  Nigeria , after a
dam overflowed due to heavy rains, the National Emergency
Management Agency said.  Yushau Shuaib, a spokesman for the agency, confirmed that
20 people had died. He was speaking by phone from Abuja, the
capital.  A headcount for the number of people displaced is not
possible at the moment, “but they’re definitely in the
thousands,” Shuiab said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Elisha Bala-Gbogbo in
