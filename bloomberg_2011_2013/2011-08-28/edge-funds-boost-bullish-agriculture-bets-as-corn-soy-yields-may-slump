Speculators increased bullish bets
on agricultural commodities to the highest level since early May
after adverse weather eroded yield prospects for corn and
soybean crops in the U.S., the world’s top grower and exporter.  Hedge funds  and other speculators raised their net-long
positions across 11 agricultural futures and options by 15
percent to 776,774 contracts in the week through Aug. 23,
government data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the highest
since May 6. Funds became bullish on wheat for the first time
since June and wagers that soybeans will gain rose 64 percent.  “It’s really all on the supply side,” Chris Nagel, a
market analyst at Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in
 Minneapolis , said in a telephone interview. “Investors will
keep piling money into corn and beans until they see better
certainty what the crop size will be.”  The hottest summer since 1955 in Iowa and  Illinois  may mean
lower yields for corn as signs of diminished output appeared
last week during the four-day, seven-state Professional Farmers
of America Midwest field tour. The worst U.S. crop conditions
since the dust bowl era of the 1930s are tightening domestic
supplies of cotton.  Corn Gains  Corn futures for December delivery gained 4.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $7.715 a bushel at 10:16 a.m. on the Chicago Board
of Trade, after touching $7.79, the highest since June 9.
Soybeans rose as much as 1.2 percent to a six-month high of
$14.41 a bushel on the CBOT. Cotton for December delivery
climbed 1.22 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $1.0554 a pound on ICE
Futures U.S. in  New York .  A broader measure showed that funds also raised their net-
long positions in 18 commodities by 9 percent to 1.11 million
futures and options contracts, data from U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission show.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
gained as much as 1.2 percent to 665.54, the highest since Aug.
4. The gauge jumped 2.6 percent last week, the biggest such
advance since early July.  Speculators reduced positions in gold by 7.8 percent to
201,294 contracts, the third straight decline, government data
show. Holdings fell as price rose to a record $1,917.90 an ounce
on Aug. 23.  Gold futures for December delivery rose $8.90, or 0.5
