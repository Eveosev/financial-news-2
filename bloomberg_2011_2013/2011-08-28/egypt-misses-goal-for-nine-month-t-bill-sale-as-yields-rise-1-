Egypt  missed its fund-raising target
for a second-straight auction of Treasury bills as the yield on
nine-month notes rose to match the 31-month peak it reached in
June.  The Arab country sold 2 billion pounds in nine-month
securities out of the 3.5 billion pounds it had targeted,
according to data posted on the  Finance Ministry website . The
average yield on the notes gained seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point from an auction of similar-maturity bills last
week to 12.981 percent, the highest level since June 26. The
ministry also sold three-month notes at an average yield of
11.995 percent, five basis points higher than last week,
according to the data.  Yields on Egyptian Treasury bills are near the highest
levels in almost three years after the revolt that toppled
President  Hosni Mubarak  in February.  The government was able to bring down its borrowing costs
briefly last month after cancelling a Treasury bill sale in June
because investors were demanding high returns, before rates
resumed gains this month.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond due
April 2020 advanced 1 basis point to 5.57 percent on Aug. 28.
The pound was little changed at 5.9591 per dollar.  Egypt’s central bank, which holds weekly treasury bill
auctions on behalf of the  Finance Ministry , plans to raise 11
billion pounds at treasury bill sales by Sept. 5. It will seek
bids for a combined 5 billion pounds in three-month and nine-
month bills on Sept. 4 and a combined 6 billion pounds in six-
month and one-year notes on Sept. 5, according to data it posted
on Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
