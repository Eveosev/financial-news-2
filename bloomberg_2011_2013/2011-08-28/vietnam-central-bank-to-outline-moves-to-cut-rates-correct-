(Corrects attribution in the lead.)  Vietnam’s  central bank  will announce
policy moves to reduce  interest rates  at a meeting with the
country’s commercial banks in September, according to a
statement posted on the government’s website late yesterday.  A meeting between the central bank and 12 commercial banks
Aug. 26 concluded with an agreement that lending rates for the
manufacturing sector should be lowered to help address
difficulties faced by businesses trying to borrow capital,
according to the statement. Yesterday’s statement didn’t provide
a date for the September meeting.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
