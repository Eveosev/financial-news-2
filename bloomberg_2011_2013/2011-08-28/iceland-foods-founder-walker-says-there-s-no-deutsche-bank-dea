Malcolm Walker, founder of Iceland
Foods Ltd., said he hasn’t gained backing from Deutsche Bank AG
or any other lender for his planned bid to regain control of the
U.K.-based frozen-food chain.  A story in today’s Sunday Times saying Walker reached a
deal with Deutsche Bank is “complete rubbish,” he said today
in a phone interview.  “We talked to Deutsche Bank and we talked to lots of other
banks as well,” he said.  Walker, Iceland’s second-largest shareholder, is seeking to
thwart rival William Morrison Supermarkets Plc’s plan to take
over the company, the Sunday Times said in its story.  To contact the reporter on this story:
