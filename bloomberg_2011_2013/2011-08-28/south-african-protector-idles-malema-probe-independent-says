South Africa ’s Public Protector
suspended an investigation into a company linked to the leader
of the youth arm of South Africa’s ruling  African National
Congress  because of lack of funds, the  Sunday Independent 
reported.  The probe into On-Point Engineers, as well as other
corruption investigations were stalled, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said, citing the head of the Public Protector, Thuli
Madonsela. The protector is seeking 30 million rand ($4.2
million) of emergency funding from the national Treasury, it
added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
