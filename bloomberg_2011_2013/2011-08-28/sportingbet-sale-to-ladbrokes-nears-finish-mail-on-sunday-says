Sportingbet Plc (SBT) ’s planned takeover
by competing online-betting company  Ladbrokes Plc (LAD)  could be
completed by September, the Mail on Sunday reported, without
saying where it got the information.  The “key obstacle” to the deal has been Sportingbet’s
Turkish operation, which GVC Holdings Plc is now considering
buying, according to the newspaper. A price for the Ladbrokes
deal hasn’t been reached, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
