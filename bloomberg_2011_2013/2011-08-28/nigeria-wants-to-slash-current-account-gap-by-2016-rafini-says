(Corrects spelling of Niger in first paragraph of story
first published on Aug. 28.)  Niger’s government wants to reduce
the current-account deficit to less than less than 5 percent of
gross domestic product by 2016 by reducing the trade gap, Prime
Minister Brig Rafini said in a statement.  The premier also wants to implement “adequate” economic
measures to modernize the economy and diversify it from its
agricultural industrial base to reach annual average growth of 7
percent over the next five years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
