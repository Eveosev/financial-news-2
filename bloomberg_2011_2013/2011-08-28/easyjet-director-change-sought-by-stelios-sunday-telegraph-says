Stelios Haji-Ioannou,  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ’s
founder and biggest shareholder, plans to demand the removal of
at least one non-executive director in a dispute over a deal for
new aircraft, the Sunday Telegraph reported.  Haji-Ioannou’s call, expected this week, will accompany his
stipulation that EasyJet renegotiate a $1.1 billion deal for 145
Airbus SAS aircraft, according to the report. The expected
demand follows the resignation of the carrier’s senior
independent director, David Michels, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
