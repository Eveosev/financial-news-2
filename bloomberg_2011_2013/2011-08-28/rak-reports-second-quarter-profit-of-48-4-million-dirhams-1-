RAK Petroleum Plc, a United Arab
Emirates-based oil and gas producer, posted second-quarter net
income of 48.4 million dirhams ($13.17 million), after taking a
share of profit from associate company  DNO International ASA. (DNO)   The Norwegian operator, the first foreign company to pump
oil in  Iraq  since the 1970s, posted second-quarter net income of
216.1 million kroner ($40 million), it said on Aug. 17. RAK
Petroleum owns 30 percent of DNO.  “I am delighted to see our associate company DNO
International begin to make a contribution to the RAK Petroleum
bottom line,” said Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani, chairman of the
board of directors and chief executive officer of RAK Petroleum.
DNO returned to profit last quarter after a dispute over
payments in Iraq was resolved.  On a standalone basis RAK, based in the emirate of Ras  Al
Khaimah , posted a second-quarter operating profit of 4.6 million
dirhams, it said in an e-mailed statement today. The company
last year reported net profit of 9.6 million dirhams for the
quarter ended June 30.  DNO and RAK said last month they will combine their Middle
East and African businesses, in a transaction that will increase
RAK’s stage in the Norwegian company to about 40 percent. The
operations will be a unit of Oslo-based DNO.  To contact the reporters on this story:
