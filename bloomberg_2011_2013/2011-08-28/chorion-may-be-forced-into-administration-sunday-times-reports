Chorion Plc, owner of children’s
characters Mr. Men and Noddy, may be forced into administration
by its lenders after failing to raise funds, the Sunday Times
reported, without saying where it got the information.  Accounting firm Deloitte LLP has been lined up to handle
the administration, which could happen as soon as this week,
according to the report.  A telephone call and e-mail message to Chorion’s offices
outside of business hours weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
