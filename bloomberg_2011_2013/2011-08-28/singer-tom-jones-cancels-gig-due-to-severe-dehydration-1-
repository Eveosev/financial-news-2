Singer  Tom Jones  was ordered by
doctors not to perform in  Monte Carlo  yesterday due to “severe
dehydration” and not because of a reported heart problem, a
statement on his official website said.  “This was the last date of a very successful three month
tour, where many of the shows were in locations that were in the
throes of high summer heat,” the statement issued today said.
“There are no heart problems, as has been reported in the
press.”  The 71-year-old singer spent the night at the Princess
Grace Hospital in Monte Carlo, where he was said to be well, the
British Broadcasting Corp. reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
