(Corrects purpose of agency in first paragraph.)  The Brazilian securities regulatorâ€™s
president, Maria Helena Santana, urged banks to start operations
at an information center aimed at increasing transparency on
derivatives contracts between banks and companies.  The regulator, known as CVM, is also concerned about
surging volumes at so-called exchange-traded funds, which call
for increasing supervision, Santana said today at an event in
Campos do Jordao.  To contact the reporter on this story:
