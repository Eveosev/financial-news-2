European policy makers are
considering providing central guarantees over some types of debt
sold by banks to prevent a new credit crunch in the region,
Sunday Times reported.  The debt guarantee will allow cash from the 440 billion-
euro ($635 billion) European Financial Stability Fund to be used
temporarily to insure banks’ bonds, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
