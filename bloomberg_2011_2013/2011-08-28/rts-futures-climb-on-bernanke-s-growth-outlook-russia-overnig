Russia’s RTS stock-index futures
rose, indicating stocks may advance in Moscow, as Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said U.S. economic growth will
pick up and as  oil prices  climbed.  Futures on the dollar-denominated index expiring in
September gained 1.3 percent to 160,625 on Aug. 26, following
Moscow’s 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF) , which rose 1.1 percent to close
at 1,458.84, after falling as much as 1.1 percent earlier in the
day. The Micex may climb 2 percent at the start of trading
today, according to  Alfa Bank . Asian stocks rose for a third
day.  United Co. Rusal’s Hong Kong traded shares climbed 2.8
percent to HK$8.22 as of 9:32 a.m. in Moscow. The company
expects to complete debt refinancing talks in about four weeks,
allowing the world’s largest aluminum maker to start paying
dividends for the first time since it listed, said Oleg
Mukhamedshin, Rusal’s head of capital markets, on a conference
call today.  Futures contracts on OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil
producer, gained 0.9 percent and those for OAO Sberbank,
 Russia ’s largest lender, advanced the same amount. Contracts on
OAO Gazprom, the world’s largest gas producer, rose 0.8 percent.  Bernanke, speaking at the annual Fed symposium in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming , indicated the central bank still may take steps
to stimulate the economy, though didn’t provide details as to
when or whether policy makers may deploy them. The Fed chairman
didn’t rule out options including a third round of government
bond buying, known as quantitative easing.  ‘Sensitive’  Russian “indices, and investor sentiment, are very
sensitive to changes on  Wall Street ,”  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at Troika Dialog, Russia’s oldest investment bank,
said by e-mail from Moscow. “When the U.S. markets decided, on
reflection, that Bernanke’s comments were more encouraging than
initially thought, the relief was just as palpable on Moscow’s
bourses.”  Stocks in the U.S. rebounded, with the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index rising 1.5 percent after earlier falling as much as 2
percent.  Urals crude, Russia’s chief export blend, gained 0.7
percent to $111.41 on Aug. 26, while crude advanced 0.4 percent
to $85.67 a barrel in electronic trading today in  New York .
Energy sales contribute as much as 40 percent of Russian
government revenue and 17 percent of gross domestic product,
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said in June.  The Market Vectors Russia ETF, a U.S.-traded fund that
holds Russian shares, gained 2.6 percent to $31.65 while the
Bank of New York Mellon Russia ADR Index fell 0.1 percent.  The Micex has dropped 14 percent since the start of 2011
and trades at 5.8 times analysts’ earnings estimates. That
compares with the 23 percent slide in Brazil’s Bovespa Index,
which trades at 8.8 times earnings, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The Shanghai Composite Index trades at 12 times
estimated earnings, and  India ’s Sensex has a ratio of 13.2.  The euro was little changed at 1.4437 per dollar by 5:15
