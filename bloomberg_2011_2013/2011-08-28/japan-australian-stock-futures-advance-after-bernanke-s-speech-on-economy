Japanese stocks rose for a third day
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  indicated the  U.S.
economy  isn’t deteriorating fast enough to warrant additional
stimulus.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , which gets 75 percent of its sales outside of
Japan, rose 0.6 percent.  Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) ,
Japan’s biggest lender, advanced 0.6 percent, leading gains in
banks.  Softbank Corp. (9984) , Japan’s third-largest mobile-phone
operator by revenue, gained 1.7 percent.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average rose 0.2 percent to 8,816.99
as of 9:09 a.m. in Tokyo. The broader Topix index advanced 0.2
percent to 757.76.  “Bernanke’s speech fell into what people had expected, but
by extending the next meeting, it showed they are ready to
introduce a measure,” said  Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general
manager at Daiwa Securities Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo. “U.S.
stocks have stabilized, which is a plus for Japanese stocks.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
