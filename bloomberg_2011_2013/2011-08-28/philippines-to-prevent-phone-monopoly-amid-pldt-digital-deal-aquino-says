The  Philippines  will prevent
monopoly in the telecommunications sector as it is seeks to
“resolve” issues related to the plan of  Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. (TEL)  to acquire Digital Telecommunications
Phils. Inc., President  Benigno Aquino  told a local radio.  “Our interest here is to ensure that there is no
monopoly,” Aquino said in a radio interview aired today. “We
promised a level playing field,” the president said, adding the
nation with about 85 million mobile-phone users can’t be
“tied” to one provider. Philippine Long Distance, known as
PLDT, is waiting for the government to approve the deal, its
Chairman Manuel Pangilinan said on Aug. 26. PLDT announced the
plan on March 30.    To contact the reporter on this story:
