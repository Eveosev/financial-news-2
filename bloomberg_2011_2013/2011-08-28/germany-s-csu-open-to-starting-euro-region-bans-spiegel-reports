Germany ’s CSU party, which is in a
governing coalition with German Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s
party, wants to ban European countries from the euro region that
don’t comply with criteria,  Der Spiegel  reported.  There should be the possibility that a member country that
“notoriously” fails to fulfill debt criteria is banned, the
magazine reported, citing a policy paper written by CSU General
Secretary Alexander Dobrindt and Reinhold Bocklet, the vice
president of the Bavarian state parliament.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
