Nobel-prize winning economist  Joseph Stiglitz  said  Germany  should issue more debt to increase
spending to boost the euro regionâ€™s economy,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported.  Stiglitz said it would cost Germany more money if the euro
region falls apart, than it will to save the currency, the
newspaper reported, citing an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
