Klaus Regling, the chief executive
officer of the European Financial Stability Facility, said it is
possible that the euro-region crisis could be over in two to
three years,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an interview.  For that to happen, countries need to implement their
savings and reform plans, the magazine reported, according to
the e-mailed preview of an article that will appear in this
week’s edition.  Regling said the risk that the euro currency will be
abandoned is “zero” because both weak and strong countries
have an interest in retaining it,  Der Spiegel  said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
