A team from  California  beat their
Japanese opponents to win the Little League World Series
baseball title.  Ocean View Little League of  Huntington Beach , California,
beat Hamamatsu Minami Little League of Hamamatsu City 2-1 in the
championship game today.  The start time for the game at Lamade Stadium in
Williamsport, Pennsylvania, was moved back three hours to 3 p.m.
after Tropical Storm Irene battered the east coast.  Before the Edogawa Minami All-Stars from Tokyo won last
year’s title, the U.S. had produced five straight Little League
World Series champions. The 2010 title was Japan’s first since
2003, when the Musashi Fuchu All-Stars from Tokyo beat Boynton
Beach, Florida, 10-1.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
