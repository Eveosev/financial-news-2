United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  and  FedEx
Corp. (FDX) , the biggest package-delivery companies, said they intend
to resume normal operations tomorrow as damage from Tropical
Storm Irene permits.  “Our intent is to dispatch Monday everywhere we’re
allowed,”  Norman Black , a spokesman for Atlanta-based UPS, said
in an e-mail.  FedEx, which operates the world’s largest cargo airline, is
preparing to move aircraft back to airports that were in Irene’s
path as soon as the airports open and it can get employees in
position to handle the planes and packages, said Scott Fiedler,
a spokesman for the Memphis, Tennessee-based company.  Some customers may experience delays in pickups and
deliveries because of downed trees and power failures, said
Fiedler, who estimated that FedEx has more than 10,000 employees
in the Irene storm zone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
