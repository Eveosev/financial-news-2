Aero Inventory Plc, the aircraft
parts maker that entered administration in 2009, will be put up
for sale next month by its administrator KPMG, the Mail on
Sunday reported, without saying where it got the information.  The U.K.-based company, which supplies air-conditioning
units and engine parts to carriers including  EasyJet Plc (EZJ) ,
Ryanair Holdings Plc and Qantas Airways Ltd., is expected to
fetch bids of “hundreds of millions of pounds” from private-
equity firms or trade buyers, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
