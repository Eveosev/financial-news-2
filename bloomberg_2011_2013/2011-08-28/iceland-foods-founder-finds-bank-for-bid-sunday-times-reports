Malcolm Walker, founder of Iceland
Foods Ltd., gained backing from Deutsche Bank AG for his bid to
regain control of the retailer, according to Sunday Times.  Walker, the second-largest shareholder in Iceland, is
seeking to thwart rival William Morrison Supermarkets Plc’s plan
to take over the company, the newspaper said. It’s not known how
much financing the bank may offer Walker, according to the
