Citic Resources Holdings Ltd. (1205)  said
profit more than doubled in the first half of the year, boosted
by a 61 percent surge in sales of crude oil.  Net income climbed 135 percent to HK$393 million ($50
million) in the six months ended June 30, from HK$168 million in
the same period a year earlier, according to Hong Kong Stock
Exchange filing today. Revenue from selling crude climbed to
HK$2.8 billion. The company also booked a gain from the sale of
a stake in its Codrilla Deposit coal mine in Australia. Sales
climbed 43 percent to HK$18.4 billion.  “Post-recession economic growth particularly from emerging
markets such as the People’s Republic of  China  helped sustain
demand for energy and natural resources,” Citic Resources said
in the statement. “Global markets and economies may remain
volatile in the near term due to a rapidly changing
macroeconomic environment.”  Citic Resources has a 16.3 percent stake in Australia’s
 Macarthur Coal Ltd. (MCC) , according to the statement. The Chinese
company said July 11 it hasn’t decided whether to accept an
offer from Peabody Energy Corp. and ArcelorMittal to take over
Macarthur. Citic may join a counterbid, IG markets said this
month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
