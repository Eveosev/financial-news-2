Israel ’s 10-year government bonds
advanced, snapping a five-day decline, on speculation the
central bank will hold borrowing costs at its meeting tomorrow
to stimulate the economy.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 dropped 10 basis points, or 0.1 percentage point, to 4.58
percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel Aviv, the lowest since
Aug. 21. The  Bank of Israel  will maintain the benchmark interest
rate at 3.25 percent for a third month, according to 20 of 21
economists in a Bloomberg survey. One predicts Governor Stanley Fischer will cut the rate to 3 percent.  Economic growth slowed to an annualized 3.3 percent in the
second quarter from a revised 4.7 percent in the first quarter,
the  Central Bureau of Statistics  said Aug. 16. Israeli home
purchases declined 16 percent to 21,900 in the second quarter
from the previous three months, the  Finance Ministry  said in an
e-mailed report today.  “The risk of a slowdown in the economy and lower inflation
expectations support preemptive action in form of an interest
rate cut in the coming months or as early as tomorrow,” said
Alex Zabezhinsky, chief economist at DS Securities & Investments
Ltd. in Tel Aviv. He expects the Bank of Israel to hold rates
tomorrow and sees them declining to 2.75 percent in the next 12
months.  Consumer Prices  Two-year interest-rate swaps, an indicator of investor
expectations for  interest rates  in the next two years, dropped
11 basis points to 2.99 percent on Aug. 26, the lowest in more
than a week, according to Bloomberg data. The yield on the 5.5
percent bond due in January 2022 declined nine basis points to
4.75 percent.  Consumer prices dropped for the first time in more than a
year in July, retreating 0.3 percent from June, the statistics
bureau said Aug. 15. The annual inflation rate fell to 3.4
percent from 4.2 percent. The two-year breakeven rate, which
reflects market expectations for inflation over the time period,
dropped to 208, implying an average annual inflation rate of
2.08 percent.  “Ongoing social protests against high living costs are
already showing signs of an impact on private consumption,”
Zabezhinsky said. “Government efforts to deal with rising
housing prices are expected to bring down prices.”  Cottage Cheese  Food sales at chain stores dropped a seasonally adjusted
6.6 percent in July from June, the statistics bureau said Aug.
22, as Israelis reduced purchases amid protests. Citizens are
demonstrating against the prices of items ranging from cottage
cheese, a local staple, to housing, prompting the government to
set up a committee to address economic and social welfare
issues.  The yield on the CPI-linked bond due in June 2013 fell two
basis points to 0.94 percent. The  Tel Aviv  Bond 40 Index, which
measures inflation-linked and fixed-rate corporate bonds, rose
for the first time in four days, gaining 0.3 percent. The shekel
strengthened 0.7 percent to 3.5989 against the dollar on Aug.
26. The currency weakened 0.6 percent last week.  Investors withdrew 900 million shekels ($250 million) from
Israeli funds in the week ended Aug. 25, bringing redemptions
this month to 6.6 billion shekels, Meitav Investment House Ltd.
said today. The weekly redemptions included 600 million shekels
from corporate-bond funds and 50 million shekels from stock
funds, while  money market funds  raised about 650 million
shekels.  To contact the reporter on this story:
