Argentine oil workers last night
paralyzed operations at  YPF SA (YPFD) ’s Canadon Seco storage and
pumping installation as part of strike that started Aug. 26,
newspaper  Clarin  reported today, citing company officials it
didn’t identify by name.  The installation in southern  Argentina  is responsible for
supplying pipelines with 20 percent of the country’s crude oil
production, the newspaper  reported  on its website.  Workers, who are calling on the government to end a 120-day
intervention in union operations, are threatening to block oil
production and have taken over the Punto Loyola seaport operated
by the local unit of  Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Clarin reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
