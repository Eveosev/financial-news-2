Irelandâ€™s government will seek to
use proceeds from state-asset sales to fund initiatives to
create employment, the  Sunday Times  reported, citing an
interview with Public Spending Minister Brendan Howlin.  Howlin said the government will seek approval from the so-
called troika, comprising the  International Monetary Fund , the
European Union and  European Central Bank , to use the money in
this way during the next round of negotiations, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
