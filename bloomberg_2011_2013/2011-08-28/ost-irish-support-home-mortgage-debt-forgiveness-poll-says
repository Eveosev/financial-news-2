A majority of 70 percent of people
in Ireland support the idea of debt forgiveness for home loan
borrowers unable to keep up with full payments, the  Sunday
Independent  reported, citing a poll.  The Sunday Independent/Quantum Research poll of 500 homes
also found that 73 percent of those questioned would not resent
debt relief for such borrowers while they themselves were
meeting payment commitments, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
