NATO hopes to be able to declare
“mission accomplished” in  Libya  and end operations in the
country once there are no further threats to the civilian
population, Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said,
according to an interview published in  Le Journal du Dimanche .  “We’ll soon be able to declare, I hope, that we’ve
accomplished our mission,” Rasmussen was quoted as saying.
“Our intention is to end our operations once the situation
allows it, which is to say when we’re certain that there is no
further threat to civilians.”  The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has been deploying
aircraft over Libya since the end of March, flying about 20,000
missions over the north African country.  Libyan rebel units are now closing in on the town of Beni
Walid, a holdout for loyalists to ousted leader  Muammar Qaddafi ,
100 miles south west of Misrata. The push has added urgency
because of the failure to find Qaddafi and the hope among
opposition forces that if he is found, alive or dead, the
battles still raging south and west of Misrata will stop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
