Gold futures climbed in  New York 
after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  held off from
offering more stimulus to help economic growth, boosting the
appeal of investments that can act as a protection of wealth.  December-delivery bullion on the Comex in New York rose as
much as 2.5 percent to $1,841.50 an ounce before trading up
$19.20, or 1.1 percent, at $1,816.50 by 8:51 a.m. Immediate-
delivery gold fell 0.8 percent to $1,813.25 an ounce. The metal
has fallen as much as 11 percent from its all-time high of
$1,917.90 on Aug. 23 as equities rebounded.  Bernanke said in a speech at  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , on Aug.
26 that the central bank still has tools to stimulate the
economy, without providing details or signaling when or whether
policy makers might deploy them. A report showed U.S. gross
domestic product grew 1 percent in the second quarter, less than
the 1.1 percent economists were expecting.  “Bernanke gave markets no hints that another liquidity
injection was imminent,” Ritesh Gandhi, an analyst at Mumbai-
based investment bank Anand Rathi Group, said in a report today.
Buyers were “returning to the gold market in search of a
refuge,” Gandhi said.  A second day has been added to the Federal Open Market
Committee meeting next month for “a fuller discussion” of the
economy and the Fed’s possible response, Bernanke said Aug. 26.  Exchange-traded product holdings fell for a sixth day on
Aug. 26 to 2,152.049 metric tons after reaching a record
2,216.756 tons on Aug. 8, Bloomberg data show.  Hedge funds  and
other money managers trimmed their net-long gold positions by 6
percent to 187,681 contracts in the week to Aug. 23, data from
the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed.  ‘Insurance’ Policy  “We believe gold is an insurance policy against a rising
probability of worsening global systemic risks and the recent
price decline provides a buying opportunity,” Morgan Stanley
analysts including  Hussein Allidina  wrote in a note today.  Hiring probably slowed in August and U.S. manufacturing
contracted for the first time in two years, economists said
before reports this week. U.S. gross domestic product climbed at
a 1 percent annual rate from April through June, down from a 1.3
percent prior estimate, revised Commerce Department figures
showed Aug. 26. Another report the same day showed consumer
sentiment this month fell to the lowest level since 2008.  Silver for December delivery rose 0.5 percent to $41.20 an
ounce and palladium gained 0.3 percent to $760.60 an ounce.
Platinum for October delivery advanced 0.7 percent to $1,839.80
an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
