Corn and soybeans may rise this week
on concern that dry weather in the U.S. Midwest will erode crop
yields.  Twenty-two of 27 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo 
to  Chicago  on Aug. 26 forecast that corn will rise for a fifth
straight week, and 23 of 28 respondents said soybeans will gain.  On the Chicago Board of Trade last week, corn futures for
December delivery rose 5.8 percent to $7.67 a bushel, after
touching an 11-week high, and soybean futures for November
delivery gained 4 percent to $14.235 a bushel, after reaching
the highest price since March.  Last weekâ€™s gains in corn and soybeans were expected by the
majority of analysts and traders surveyed on Aug. 19.  Bullish on corn: 22    Bullish on soybeans: 23
Bearish on corn:  5    Bearish on soybeans:  5  To contact the reporter on this story:
