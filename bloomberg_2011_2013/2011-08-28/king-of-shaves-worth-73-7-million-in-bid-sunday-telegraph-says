King of Shaves received takeover
offers valuing the Beaconsfield, England-based shaving company
at as much as 45 million pounds ($73.7 million), the Sunday
Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information.  King of Shaves, founded by Will King in the 1990s with a
15,000-pound investment, received bids from  Spectrum Brands
Holdings Inc. (SPB) â€™s Remington brand in the U.S. and Kai Industries,
which already has a 21 percent stake in the company, according
to the newspaper. King of Shaves hired Alpha Advisory to manage
the bidding process, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
