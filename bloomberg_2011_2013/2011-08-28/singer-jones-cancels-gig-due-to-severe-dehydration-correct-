(Corrects to insert dropped word in first paragraph.)  Singer  Tom Jones  was ordered by
doctors not to perform in Monte Carlo yesterday due to “severe
dehydration” and not because of a reported heart problem, a
statement on his official website said.  “This was the last date of a very successful three month
tour, where many of the shows were in locations that were in the
throes of high summer heat,” the statement said. “There are no
heart problems, as has been reported in the press.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
