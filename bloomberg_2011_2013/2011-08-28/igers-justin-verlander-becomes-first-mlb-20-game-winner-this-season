Justin Verlander  became the first
Major League Baseball pitcher to win 20 games this season as the
 Detroit Tigers  beat the Minnesota Twins 6-4.  “Name a pitch, I had trouble finding consistency with
anything,” Verlander (20-5) told reporters last night.  He gave up four runs on eight hits in six innings while
striking out six at Target Field in  Minneapolis . Verlander threw
his second career no-hitter in May and has taken two more games
into the eighth inning before giving up hits.  Miguel Cabrera  and Alex Avila led off the second inning
with home runs for a 2-0 lead, and the Tigers (73-59) added two
more runs in the fifth.  The Twins (55-77) tied the game in the sixth on a two-run
double by Luke Hughes, after Hughes and Jason Repko hit back-to-
back home runs in the fifth.  Delmon Young and Cabrera each hit run-scoring singles in
the seventh inning to clinch the win for the Tigers.  “Get the win and get the 20 so the 20 is out of the way
and he’s not searching for it anymore,” Young told reporters.
“Now he can just go out there and try to win every start he
goes out there because he’s already got the magic number.”  Twins pitcher Carl Pavano (6-11) surrendered nine hits and
six runs in 6 2/3 innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
