Lars Feld, a member of German
Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s council of economic advisers, sees no
“serious” crisis for the real economy, or an imminent collapse
of financial markets, WirtschaftWoche reported.  Feld said fears of a “Lehmann II” are “exaggerated,”
the magazine cited him as saying, according to the e-mailed
preview of an interview that will appear in tomorrow’s edition.  To contact the reporter on this story: Ragnhild Kjetland in
