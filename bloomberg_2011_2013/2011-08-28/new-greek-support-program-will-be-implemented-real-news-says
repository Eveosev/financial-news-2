The decisions taken at the July 21
European Union summit will be applied to support the  Greek
economy ,  Real News  reported, citing Greek Finance Minister
Evangelos Venizelos.  “In spite of those who are easily alarmed, the decisions
of July 21 will be applied and the new support program for the
Greek economy will be implemented as planned,” the Athens-based
newspaper today quoted Venizelos as saying in an interview.  “The problem of the markets is not  Greece , but to test the
limits of endurance and the responsiveness of the euro zone,”
Real News cited Venizelos as saying.  “There is nothing worse for the economy than continual
recycling of rumors and negative prophesies that seek to be
fulfilled,” the paper quoted Venizelos as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
