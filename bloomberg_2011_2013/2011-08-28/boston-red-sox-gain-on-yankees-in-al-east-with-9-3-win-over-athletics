The  Boston Red Sox  padded their
American League East lead by one game with a sweep of the
doubleheader against the Oakland Athletics as the  New York
Yankees  were rained out in Baltimore.  The Red Sox defeated the Athletics 4-0 in the night cap
after taking the earlier game 9-3 at Fenway Park in  Boston . Both
games were delayed by rain.  In the night game, David Ortiz hit a two-run homer in the
second inning, while Dustin Pedroia scored on Jarrod Saltalamacchia’s groundout in the fourth and Jed Lowrie reached
home on Saltalamacchia’s double in the sixth inning.  Alfredo Aceves (9-1) struck out three and walked one in
three innings for the win.  In the day game, Jason Varitek hit a two-run homer and
 Jacoby Ellsbury  hit a one-run double to give the  Red Sox  a 4-1
lead in the second inning. Boston scored five more runs by the
end of the fifth.  Jon Lester (14-6) allowed three hits and two runs and
struck out four in six innings for Boston.  The Red Sox moved up a game against Oakland originally
scheduled for tomorrow, when Irene is forecast to unleash
hurricane-strength winds and heavy rains on New England.  Boston is two games ahead of the Yankees, whose
doubleheader against the Baltimore Orioles was postponed
yesterday. One game was moved to today when the teams have a
doubleheader, and the other will be played Sept. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
