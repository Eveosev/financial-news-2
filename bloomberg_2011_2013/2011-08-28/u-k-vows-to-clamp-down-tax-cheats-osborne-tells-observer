The British government will take a
tough stance on  tax evasion , Chancellor  George Osborne  wrote in
the Observer newspaper.  The agreement the U.K. reached last week with Switzerland
to make it harder for people to hide money is just the start of
the governmentâ€™s efforts to reduce cheating, Osborne wrote.  The government has found 900 million pounds ($1.5 billion)
for HM Revenue & Customs to fight tax evasion, he said in the
commentary.  To contact the reporter on this story:
