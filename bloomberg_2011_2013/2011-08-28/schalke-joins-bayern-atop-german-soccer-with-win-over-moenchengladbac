leader  Bayern Munich  in German soccer’s Bundesliga with a 1-0
home win over Borussia Moenchengladbach.  Raul got the goal in the 64th minute yesterday as Schalke
took its points tally to nine from four games, behind Bayern and
ahead of Werder Bremen on goal difference.  Bayern won 3-0 at Kaiserslautern, while Bremen was a 2-1
victor at Hoffenheim.  Montpellier still leads the French league, even after a 2-1
loss at second-place Lyon two days ago.  In  Spain , Real  Madrid  yesterday eased to a 6-0 win at Real
Zaragoza, with three goals by  Cristiano Ronaldo . Real Sociedad
and Valencia were also among the winners as the league program

matches. Barcelona hosts Villarreal today.  FC Twente  leads the Dutch standings by two points from Ajax
after a 3-1 win over VVV-Venlo two days ago. Ajax beat Vitesse
