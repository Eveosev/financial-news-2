The Canadian dollar fell versus the
majority of its most-traded peers before July consumer price
index data that is forecast to remain below the Bank of Canadaâ€™s
2 percent inflation target.  Consumer prices rose 1.4 percent last month from a year
earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey.  The loonie, as the Canadian dollar is known for the image
of the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, weakened  0.4 percent at
C$1.0554 per U.S. dollar at 7:50 a.m. in Toronto. One loonie
buys 94.75 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
