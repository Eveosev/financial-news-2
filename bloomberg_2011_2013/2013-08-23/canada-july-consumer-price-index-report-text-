The following is the text of
Canada’s  consumer price index  report for July released
by  Statistics Canada .  The Consumer  Price Index  (CPI) rose 1.3% in the 12 months
to July, following a 1.2% increase in June.  The increase in the CPI in July was led by transportation
prices, which rose 2.7% on a year-over-year basis, following a
2.0% gain in June.  Compared with July last year, consumers paid 6.1% more for
gasoline. This followed a 4.6% increase in June. Gasoline prices
rose in all provinces, with Prince  Edward Island  (+13.9%)
recording the largest gain and Saskatchewan (+2.7%) posting the
smallest increase.  Prices for the purchase of passenger vehicles rose 2.0% in
the 12 months to July, matching the increase in June.  12-month change in the major components  In addition to transportation, the shelter component was a
main upward contributor to the increase in the CPI in July. At
the same time, the food index posted its smallest year-over-year
increase in over three years. The index for health and personal
care was the only major component to record a decline in July.  Shelter costs rose 1.3% in the 12 months to July, after
increasing 1.2% in June. Compared with July last year, natural
gas prices and rent increased, while mortgage interest cost
declined 3.8%.  Food prices rose 0.8% in the 12 months to July, following a
1.2% advance in June. The July increase was the smallest gain in
food prices since June 2010. The cost of food purchased from
stores rose 0.5% in the 12 months to July, a smaller increase
than in June (+1.3%). Prices for fresh fruit, fresh vegetables
and meat all increased less in July compared with June.  Conversely, prices for food purchased from restaurants
advanced 1.5% on a year-over-year basis in July, following a
1.1% increase in June.  The health and personal care component decreased on a year-over-year basis for the fourth consecutive month in July. These
declines followed more than a decade of price increases. The
recent declines are mainly attributable to falling prices for
prescribed medicines.  12-month change in the provinces  Consumer prices rose in nine provinces in the 12 months to
July with the largest increase occurring in Manitoba. The
exception was British Columbia, where prices posted no change on
a year-over-year basis in July.  In Manitoba, consumer prices rose 3.0% in the 12 months to
July, following a 2.7% gain in June. Manitoba posted larger
year-over-year price increases for gasoline, for passenger
vehicle registration fees and for cigarettes compared with the
national average. On July 1, 2013, the Provincial Sales Tax in
Manitoba rose from 7% to 8%.  Prices in British Columbia posted no change in the 12
months to July, after falling 0.5% in June. The province
continued to post year-over-year price decreases for food
purchased from restaurants and homeowners’ replacement cost.
Conversely, consumers in British Columbia paid 7.3% more for
gasoline in July compared with the same month a year ago.  Saskatchewan and Alberta were the only two provinces where
consumer prices rose at a slower year-over-year rate in July
compared with June. In both provinces, prices for gasoline, for
natural gas and for the purchase of passenger vehicles advanced
less in the 12 months to July than in the 12 months to June.  Seasonally adjusted monthly CPI increases  On a seasonally adjusted
( http://www23.statcan.gc.ca:81/imdb/p2SV_e.pl?Function=getSurvey 
&amp;SDDS=2301&amp;lang=en&amp;db=imdb&amp;adm=8&amp;dis=2#b10)
monthly basis, the CPI rose 0.2% in July, matching the increases
in May and June.  On a seasonally adjusted basis, four of the eight major
components posted increases in July. The largest gain was in the
household operations, furnishings and equipment component
(+0.4%).  The price indexes for clothing and footwear as well as
transportation posted no change in July. However, before
seasonal adjustment, these indexes decreased 0.9% and 0.3%
respectively. This indicates that the observed price declines
for these components were largely seasonal.  The seasonally adjusted indexes for food (-0.1%) and for
alcoholic beverages and tobacco products (-0.3%) were the only
components to post declines.  Bank of Canada’s core index  The Bank of  Canada ’s core index
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/62-001-x/2013007/technote-notetech2-eng.htm ) rose 1.4% in the 12 months to July, following
a 1.3% increase in June.  On a monthly basis, the seasonally adjusted core index
increased 0.1% in July, after rising 0.2% in the previous month.  Shrinking gaps between provincial gasoline price indexes and
between crude oil benchmarks  Starting in 2011, provincial gasoline price indexes began
to diverge. In general, gasoline price indexes increased at a
slightly faster pace in Central and Eastern Canada than in the
West, resulting in a spread between some provincial gasoline
indexes.  This observed spread in price indexes for gasoline is
largely associated with the dual crude oil market in Canada and
the price differential between the West Texas Intermediate (WTI)
and Brent crude oil benchmarks.  In recent months, the divergence between provincial
gasoline price indexes has disappeared. The closing of this gap
between gasoline price indexes has coincided with the shrinking
of the price differential between the two crude oil benchmarks.  For more information on the divergence between provincial
gasoline price indexes and the dual crude oil market in Canada
see “Study: Canada’s dual crude oil market and the influence on
changes in gasoline prices”. ( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/121123/dq121123b-eng.htm )  Note to readers  A seasonally adjusted series is one from which seasonal
movements have been eliminated. Users employing CPI data for
indexation purposes are advised to use the unadjusted indexes.

most volatile components (fruit, fruit preparations and nuts;
vegetables and vegetable preparations; mortgage interest cost;
natural gas;  fuel oil  and other fuels; gasoline; inter-city
transportation; and tobacco products and smokers’ supplies) as
well as the effects of changes in indirect taxes on the
remaining components.  To contact the reporter on this story:
