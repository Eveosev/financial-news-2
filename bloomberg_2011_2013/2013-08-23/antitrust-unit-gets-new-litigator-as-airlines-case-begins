A  Washington  lawyer with experience
in major antitrust cases has been named head of litigation for
the U.S. Justice Department’s antitrust division after the
government sued to block the merger of AMR Corp.’s American
Airlines and  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)   David Gelfand, a partner at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen &
Hamilton LLP in Washington, recently represented clients
including Henkel AG, ArcelorMittal SA and Sanofi in antitrust
litigation, according to the firm’s website.  Gelfand also represented Google Inc. before regulators in
its acquisitions of AdMob Inc. and DoubleClick Inc. and was
involved in transactions including  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ) ’s
purchase of Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc., and Molson
Coors Brewing Co.s merger with  SABMiller Plc (SAB) , according to the
firm.  Gelfand, 54, will replace  Joseph Wayland , who stepped down
in November after two years at the division. Wayland led the
department’s successful litigation to stop  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s takeover
of  T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS)  and  H&R Block Inc. (HRB) ’s attempt to buy a
smaller competitor, acting as the lead courtroom lawyer for the
government in both cases.  To contact the reporter on this story:
