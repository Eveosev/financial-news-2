from a sell equivalent.  “Renren makes a lot of profit from the deal, as its 41
percent stake in Nuomi also becomes more valuable based on
Baidu’s purchase price,” Ming Zhao, the founder of Hong Kong-based 86Research Ltd. said by e-mail yesterday. “The deal is
expensive to Baidu in math, but it has strategic long-term
meaning, and it can grow Nuomi bigger.”  The iShares China Large-Cap  ETF (FXI) , the largest Chinese
