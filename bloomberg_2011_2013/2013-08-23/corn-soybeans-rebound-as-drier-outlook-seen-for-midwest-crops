Corn rallied from the biggest loss
since June and soybeans climbed amid concerns that the weather
may turn dry and hurt crops in the Midwest, the largest U.S.
producing region.  Corn for December delivery gained as much as 0.9 percent to
$4.685 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $4.675
by 10:25 a.m. in  Singapore . Prices dropped 3.9 percent yesterday,
the most since June 28, amid wet weather in the Midwest, paring
a second weekly gain.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of eight agricultural
commodities slumped 19 percent this year with corn tumbling 33
percent as the U.S. Department of Agriculture predicts a record
13.76 billion-bushel national harvest. While heavier-than-expected rains in the Midwest overnight may help ease dryness
concerns, there will be little additional precipitation during
the next 7 days or more, DTN said in a report yesterday.  “It’s really just a weather market at the moment,” said
Graydon Chong, a grains and oilseed analyst at Rabobank
International in Sydney. “When it’s raining in the row-crop
areas we’re going to see markets come off and when it turns
drier again, we’ll see markets tick up.”  Soybeans for November delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
$12.9875 a bushel, set to gain for a third week. Wheat for
delivery in December lost 0.3 percent to $6.3875 a bushel, down
for a third week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
