Australia ’s bowlers restricted
 England  to 181-3 at tea to lead by 311 runs on day three of the
final Ashes cricket Test at the Oval in London.  England scored just 84 runs off 38 overs in the post-lunch
session.  Kevin Pietersen  and  Ian Bell  are unbeaten as the home
team seeks an unprecedented 4-0 series win against its oldest
rival.  Opener Joe Root hit two fours in the first over after the
break, before the visitors’ attack gave England’s batsmen few
chances to score. Root and Jonathan Trott crept to a 50-run
partnership before Root top-edged a sweep and was caught off the
bowling of spinner Nathan Lyon. His score of 68 was the 22-year-old’s second-highest of the series.  Pietersen joined Trott at the crease and found runs hard to
come by with his 29 coming off 82 balls.  Australia opted to take the second new ball at the earliest
opportunity, handing it to fast-bowler Mitchell Starc in the
last over before tea. The decision paid off as Trott was out
leg-before-wicket on Starc’s first delivery. Bell, who has
scored three centuries in the series, is not out on four.  An extra eight overs is scheduled today, and on the final
two days, making up for some of the play lost yesterday to rain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
