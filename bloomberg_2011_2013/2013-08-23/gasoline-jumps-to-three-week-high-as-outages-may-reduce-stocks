Gasoline jumped to a three-week high
as unscheduled refinery shutdowns from Canada to Texas will
crimp supplies before the Sept. 2 U.S. Labor Day holiday.  Futures rose as much as 1.6 percent after Irving Oil
Corp.’s Saint John  refinery  in  New Brunswick  shut a fluid
catalytic cracker, according to Genscape Inc., a Louisville,
Kentucky-based energy information provider. Motiva Enterprises
LLC reduced rates at its Convent, Louisiana, and  Port Arthur ,
Texas, plants after fires shut units.  “The market is very nervous going into the weekend because
of all these refinery issues,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market
analyst at Price Futures Group in Chicago.  Gasoline for September delivery rose 2.04 cents, or 0.7
percent, to $2.9852 a gallon at 10:09 a.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange on trading volume that was 70 percent above
100-day average. Prices are up 0.6 percent this week.  Total U.S. gasoline  inventories  fell 4.03 million barrels
last week, according to the Energy Information Administration.
Supplies on the East Coast, which includes New York Harbor, the
delivery point for gasoline and diesel contracts, slipped 2.74
million barrels to 58.5 million, the lowest since March 29.  “We saw a big draw in gasoline this week, there’s the idea
that some refineries are offline and next weekend is a
holiday,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford , Connecticut.  Crack Spreads  The motor fuel’s crack  spread  versus West Texas
Intermediate crude widened 93 cents to $15.11 a barrel. The
fuel’s  premium  over Brent rose 37 cents to $9.68.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, rose 0.2 cent to $3.536 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.
Prices are 18.2 cents below a year earlier.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for September delivery rose 1.2
cents, or 0.4 percent, to $3.0819 a gallon on trading volume
that was 14 percent below the 100-day average. Prices are little
changed this week.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI rose 84 cents to $24.91 a
barrel. The  premium over Brent  widened 26 cents to $19.46.  To contact the reporters on this story:
