Palm oil  headed for the first back-to-back weekly gains since June, trading near a six-week high,
on speculation that a weakening Malaysian currency would boost
exports from the world’s second-largest producer.  The contract for November delivery swung between gains and
losses before ending the morning session 5 ringgit lower at
2,351 ringgit ($711) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives. Futures earlier touched 2,362 ringgit to match
yesterday’s intraday peak, which was the highest level since
July 11. Prices are set for a 1.8 percent rise this week after a
4.6 percent advance in the previous five-day period.  Exports climbed 10 percent to 880,979 tons in the first 20
days of this month from the same period in July, surveyor
Intertek said Aug. 20. Shipments gained 12 percent, according to
SGS (Malaysia) Sdn. The ringgit, which touched its weakest level
against the  U.S. dollar  in three years yesterday, has
depreciated 7.5 percent this year.  “The ringgit is supporting palm oil,” said Vijay Mehta, a
director of Commodity Links Pte. in Singapore. Declining
reserves in India may boost purchases by the biggest buyer.  Imports by India will climb to a record 10.5 million tons
to 10.7 million tons in the year ending Oct. 31 from 10.2
million tons a year earlier, B.V. Mehta, executive director of
the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India said Aug. 20.
Purchases will rise even as the Indian rupee tumbled to a record
low against the dollar, he said.  Soybean oil  for delivery in December climbed 0.4 percent to
42.95 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybeans for
November delivery increased 0.9 percent to $12.9825 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery was little changed at
5,528  yuan  ($903) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
Soybean oil dropped 0.3 percent to 7,078 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
