Canadian  stocks  rose, closing at the
highest level in five months, as gold producers surged after a
plunge in U.S. new-home sales boosted speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain stimulus.  Alacer Gold Corp. and Iamgold Corp. rallied at least 5.9
percent as the metal traded at its highest in 11 weeks.  Maple
Leaf Foods Inc. (MFI)  jumped 7.8 percent as it agreed to sell a unit
for C$645 million ($614 million).  Penn West Petroleum (PWT)  Ltd. added
1.7 percent after cutting 25 percent of its workforce to reduce
costs.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  rose 87.95
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,762.30 at 4 p.m. in Toronto, the
highest level since March 20. The index erased losses from
earlier in the week to finish the five-day period 0.2 higher.  “We’re seeing a lot more volatility creep in, especially
in the U.S., and that’s pushing people back to gold as a safe
haven,” said  Andrew Pyle , a  fund manager  with ScotiaMcLeod Inc.
in Peterborough, Ontario. He manages about C$210 million. “When
we look forward, we’re still talking about the Fed tapering,
that’s why you’re seeing the gold producers in Canada mount a
gradual recovery.”  Sales of newly built homes in the U.S. plunged the most in
more than three years last month. The July minutes of the
 Federal Open Market Committee  showed policy makers are
“supportive” of Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plan to begin
scaling back the bank’s $85 billion a month bond purchases later
this year. Central-bank stimulus has helped propel global
equities higher.  ‘Reassessing Growth’  “The data may have markets reassessing U.S. growth and
when, or by how much, the Fed will taper quantitative easing,”
said Andrew Grantham, an economist with  CIBC World Markets  in a
note today.  The price of gold rallied on the housing data, briefly
topping $1,400 an ounce to its highest level since June 7. The
price of gold settled up 1.5 percent at $1,396.30.  The S&P/TSX Gold Index surged 2.7 percent to a four-month
high. While the index has rallied 42 percent since June 26, it
remains down 27 percent this year. Alacer Gold soared 7.2
percent to C$3.27 and Iamgold rallied 5.9 percent to C$7.06.  Raw-materials producers climbed 1.6 percent as a group for
the  biggest  gain in the S&P/TSX, with all 10 industry groups
advancing. Trading volume was 18 percent lower than the 30-day
average.  Bank Rally  Royal Bank of Canada , the nation’s largest lender, gained 1
percent to C$65.12 as Canada’s  banks  rose 0.8 percent to close
at the highest this month. Bank of Montreal, scheduled to report
earnings on Aug. 27, added 0.7 percent to C$65.20 for a fourth
day of gains.  Maple Leaf, the Canadian food processor, jumped 7.8
percent, the most in almost five years, to C$14.44, after
agreeing to sell its Rothsay animal-rendering business to
Darling International.  Suncor Energy Inc. (SU)  added 1.9 percent to C$36.06 as crude
erased earlier losses to advance 1.3 percent in New York on
signs of accelerating economic growth in Europe and unrest in
the  Middle East .  Penn West Petroleum, based in Calgary, rose 1.7 percent to
C$12.12. The company has cut 550 jobs from the beginning of the
year and expects to record an expense of about C$25 million in
the third quarter related to the move.  To contact the reporter on this story:
