JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is reviewing
its correspondent banking unit and not taking on new business
from foreign lenders after regulators identified deficiencies in
its anti-money-laundering procedures.  The bank said in a memo last week that its treasury
services unit won’t take on new correspondent clients or new
business from existing customers who use the bank to process
transactions, according to  Brian Marchiony , a spokesman. The
halt allows JPMorgan to review its existing relationships, he
said. The Wall Street Journal reported the memo yesterday.  “Serving financial institutions in correspondent banking
has been, and will continue to be, a core strength of ours,”
Marchiony said in an e-mailed statement. “It’s important for us
to pause and assess our business, particularly in select
markets, to ensure we are well-positioned to meet our
responsibilities for the long-term.”  The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued a
 consent order  in January after finding that the bank “has an
inadequate system of internal controls and independent testing”
for anti-money-laundering compliance. The firm “failed to
identify significant volumes of suspicious activity” and to
file reports alerting regulators, according to the order.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) , Europe’s biggest bank, last year agreed
to pay $1.92 billion to settle U.S. probes of  money laundering .  To contact the reporter on this story:
