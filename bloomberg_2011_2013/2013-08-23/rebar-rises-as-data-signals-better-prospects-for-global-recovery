Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
for the first time in four days, erasing a weekly loss, after
reports from  China  to  Europe  and the U.S. boosted confidence in
the prospects for global economic recovery.  Rebar for January delivery gained as much as 1.4 percent to
3,820  yuan  ($624) a metric ton before trading at 3,813 yuan at
10:30 a.m. local time. The contract fell by 1.1 percent this
week before today. Futures touched a four-month high at 3,848
yuan on Aug. 14.  Factory output in the euro area is improving more than
economists estimated and the fewest U.S. workers in more than
five years applied for jobless benefits, reports yesterday
showed. Chinese factory output rose more than estimated in July,
according to a report by the HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit
Economics yesterday.  “Rebar’s upward trend doesn’t seem to have run its course
yet with more positive economic indicators convincing everybody
of a recovery story,” said Wang Yongliang, an analyst at
Beijing Cifco Futures Co. in Tianjin.  The  average spot  price of rebar fell for the second day
yesterday, dropping 0.4 percent to 3,622 yuan a ton, according
to Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed at $137.70 a dry ton yesterday, according to a  price
index  compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
