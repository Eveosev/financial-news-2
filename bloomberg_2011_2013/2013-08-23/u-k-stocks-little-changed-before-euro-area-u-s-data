U.K. stocks  advanced as a report
showed economic growth accelerated in the second quarter more
than initially forecast.  Croda International Plc (CRDA)  climbed 4.3 percent after Deutsche
Bank AG raised its rating on the world’s second-largest maker of
cosmetic ingredients to buy from hold. Henry Boot Plc, the
property company that built Pinewood film studios, rose 6.4
percent after reporting its latest results.  The FTSE 100 added 45.23 points, or 0.7 percent, to 6,492.1
at the close of trading in London, paring its weekly loss to 0.1
percent. The index has traded between 6,386.72 and 6,516.71, a 2
percent range, for the past six sessions amid speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will taper bond buying as soon as next month.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index also rose 0.7 percent, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index increased 0.2 percent.  “The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  is stuck in a range and it is difficult to
see it popping out amid persistent tapering talk and
volatility,” Ishaq Siddiqi, a London-based market strategist at
ETX Capital in London, said in a phone interview. “All facets
of the U.K. economy have gathered steam, but the FTSE 100 will
need to break above 6,520 to carry on its rally.”  The volume of shares changing hands in FTSE-100 listed
companies was 20 percent lower than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gross domestic product  increased 0.7 percent from the first
quarter, when it rose 0.3 percent, the  Office for National
Statistics  said in  London  today. That compared with an initial
estimate of 0.6 percent. Exports rose the most in more than a
year and net trade contributed 0.3 percentage point to GDP.  Consumer Confidence  Euro-area  consumer confidence  increased more in August than
economists estimated. An index of household sentiment improved
for a ninth month to minus 15.6, the highest level since July
2011, from minus 17.4 in the previous month, the European
Commission said in a preliminary report today. Economists had
forecast an increase to minus 16.5, according to the median of
26 estimates in a  Bloomberg News survey .  Purchases of  new U.S. homes  plunged in July by the most in
more than three years and previous months were revised down.  Sales of newly built homes declined 13.4 percent to a
394,000 annualized pace, the weakest since October, following a
455,000 rate in the prior period that was lower than previously
estimated, Commerce Department figures showed today in
 Washington . The median estimate of 74 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a decrease to 487,000.  Croda Upgraded  Croda climbed 4.3 percent to 2,677 pence, its biggest gain
since October. Deutsche Bank upgraded its stance on the shares
to buy from hold.  “Top-line growth has slowed over the past year and lagged
some of its consumer-focused peers in chemicals,” analysts at
Deutsche Bank, led by Martin Dunwoodie, wrote in a report
distributed today. “We view this slowdown as cyclical rather
than structural and expect sales growth to accelerate.”  Henry Boot (BHY)  advanced 6.4 percent to 198.5 pence. The company
said business has been in line with forecasts and predicted an
improvement in the trading environment. First-half revenue
almost doubled from a year earlier to 81.8 million pounds ($123
million), while net income advanced to 4.7 million pounds from
2.9 million pounds, it said.  Afren Plc (AFR)  declined 0.2 percent, paring earlier losses of as
much as 5.8 percent, after reporting first-half results. The
U.K.-based oil and gas company focused on West Africa and  Iraq 
said profit after tax fell 39 percent in the period while
revenue rose 2 percent.  Carpetright Plc (CPR)  dropped 0.8 percent to 665 pence. The
U.K.’s largest carpet and flooring retailer and five other
domestic companies are misleading consumers by inflating prices
before offering discounts, the  Office of Fair Trading  said as it
asked the stores to stop the practice.  “There is no suggestion in the letter of Carpetright
having behaved in a manner which breaches competition law,” the
retailer said in a statement after receiving the OFT’s request.  To contact the reporters on this story:
