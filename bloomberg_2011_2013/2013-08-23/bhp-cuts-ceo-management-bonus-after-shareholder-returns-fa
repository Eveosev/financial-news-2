BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s
biggest mining company, said long-term bonus pay-outs to its
chief executive officer and management committee will be cut by
35 percent after shareholder returns fell.  CEO Andrew Mackenzie will receive 243,126 of the 450,964
bonus awards originally granted to him, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. He elected to forgo 50,000
awards on top of the 35 percent cut, BHP said.  According to the performance rules of a five-year incentive
plan, members of the group management including CEO, would have
received the award in full. Under the bonus plan granted in
2008, BHP had to deliver a shareholder return that exceeded a
group of peer companies by an average of 5.5 percent for the
five years ended June 30. BHP declined 9.4 percent in the
period, compared with the 44 percent slump of its peers.  “While the committee recognized that total shareholder
return performance was delivered in a difficult business
environment, it also felt that more closely aligning the
experience of shareholders and executives was important,” BHP
said. The bonuses also “reflect a more modest approach to
renumeration befitting the times,” it said.  BHP in April said Mackenzie will receive less pay than his
predecessor  Marius Kloppers  at a time of declining commodity
prices and revenue for the industry. Mackenzie, who took over in
May, will be paid a base salary of $1.7 million during fiscal
2014. Kloppers’ base salary in 2007, when he became CEO, was
$1.85 million, according to BHP’s annual report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
