Gasoline on the northeastern U.S.
spot market strengthened to the smallest discount to futures in
six months after Canada’s largest refinery shut a fuel
production unit.  Irving Oil Corp. halted a 70,000-barrel-a-day fluid
catalytic cracker at the  refinery  in Saint John,  New Brunswick ,
today, according to Genscape Inc., an energy information company
based in Louisville,  Kentucky .  Carolyn Van der Veen, a
spokeswoman for Irving, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment.  The spread for conventional, 83.5-octane gasoline, or CBOB,
in  New York  Harbor gained 0.5 cent to 9 cents below futures at
1:55 p.m., the narrowest since Feb. 28, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Reformulated, 84-octane gasoline, or
RBOB, rose 0.63 cent to 3.38 cents above futures.  “Irving tends to be a swing player in Northeast gasoline
markets,” said Tom Finlon, director of Jupiter, Florida-based
Energy Analytics Group LLC. “When they break down, there are
buyers.”  Finlon said the Irving shutdown amid the perception of a
shortage in U.S. gasoline supplies because imports from  Europe 
have been lower than normal.  Gasoline  stockpiles  in PADD 1, the U.S. Northeast, declined
by 2.74 million barrels, or 4.5 percent, to 58.5 million in the
week ended Aug. 16, according to the latest inventory data from
the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
