Indian (SENSEX)  equities advanced, with the
benchmark index paring a weekly loss, as the currency jumped by
the most in more than a year.  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , owner of Jaguar Land Rover, gained 3.1
percent.  HDFC Bank Ltd. (HDFCB) , the nation’s biggest lender by market
value, jumped the most in three weeks.  Bharat Heavy Electricals
Ltd. (BHEL) , the largest power-equipment maker, soared the most since
May 2009.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , operator of the world’s
largest refining complex, increased for the second day.  The S&P BSE Sensex surged 1.1 percent to 18,519.44 at the
close, with volume 53 percent more than the 30-day average. The
gauge surged 2.3 percent yesterday, rebounding from the biggest
four-day loss since July 2009. The measure still had its fifth
weekly decline amid concern steps to stem a record slide in the
rupee may curb economic growth. The currency, which fell to a
record 65.56 per dollar yesterday, rallied 2.1 percent.  “The biggest respite today is that the rupee hasn’t
weakened,”  Gajendra Nagpal , chief executive officer at New
Delhi-based Unicon Financial Intermediaries Ltd. said by phone.  Global funds pulled $12.2 billion from Indian shares and
bonds since the Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  first
flagged a possible cut in stimulus on May 22, leaving the rupee
vulnerable to the country’s record current-account deficit.  Tata Motors climbed 3.1 percent to 300.95 rupees.  Mahindra
& Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , the nation’s largest tractor maker, increased
2.6 percent to 813.8 rupees. HDFC Bank climbed 3.2 percent to
607.55 rupees, the most since Aug. 1.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC)  rose 2.6
percent to 853.05 rupees, helping the 13-member S&P BSE Bankex
add 1.9 percent.  Excessive Pessimism  Bharat Heavy rallied 8.1 percent to 116.1 rupees, paring
this year’s loss to 49 percent. The stock touched an eight-year
low on Aug. 20. BEML Ltd., a producer of earthmoving equipment,
soared 12 percent to 147.05 rupees, the most since Sept. 17.
Reliance Industries climbed 1.7 percent to 819.5 rupees.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram and  Reserve Bank 
of India Governor Duvvuri Subbarao held coordinated briefings in
 New Delhi  yesterday to try to soothe investors’ nerves.
Excessive pessimism is unwarranted, economic growth will pick up
as the year progresses and the currency’s drop has overshot
appropriate levels, Chidambaram said.  The rupee closed at 63.33, posting the biggest gain since
June 2012.  Asia’s third-largest economy may expand 5.5 percent in the
year to March 2014, according to RBI estimates. That compares
with the 10-year average of about 8 percent. Data due Aug. 30
may show the economy expanded 4.6 percent in the quarter ended
June, slower than 4.8 percent in the previous period, according
to the median estimate of 21 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  ‘More Pain’  Combined profits for the 30 companies in the Sensex rose
1.4 percent in the three months ended June, compared with an
estimate of 5.8 percent before the reporting season, Bank of
America Corp. said in a report dated Aug. 19. India follows
April-to-March financial year.  “There’s more pain to come and that will be reflected in
the second-quarter company earnings,” Jigar Shah, senior vice-president and head of research at Kim Eng Securities India Pvt.,
said in an interview on Bloomberg TV India.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies that posted earnings
for the June quarter missed analyst estimates. That compares
with 27 percent for the March quarter, and 43 percent in the
three months ended December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex has lost 4.7 percent this year and  trades  at
13.2 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
Emerging Markets Index’s 9.9 times.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  index on the National Stock Exchange added
1.2 percent to 5,471.75. India VIX, which measures the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, slumped 11 percent,
ending a five-day 55 percent rally.  International investors  sold a net $118 million of local
shares on Aug. 21, data from the regulator show. That reduced
this year’s inflow to $12.1 billion, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
