Japanese  shares  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index halting three days of losses, as exporters advanced after
the yen weakened against the dollar.  Toyota Motor Corp., Asia’s largest carmaker, climbed 2.8
percent as auto companies and electronics makers provided the
biggest support to the Topix.  Amada Co. (6113) , the third-biggest maker
of metalwork machines by market value, jumped 5.3 percent after
a report that its operating profit in the six months through
September will rise 150 percent.  Tokyo  Electric Power Co. sank
4.9 percent after the government demanded it improve irradiated
water storage after a spill escalated into the biggest crisis at
its Fukushima plant since the March 2011 disaster.  The Topix gained 2 percent to 1,141.63 at the close of
trading in Tokyo, its biggest daily advance since Aug. 13, after
yesterday closing at the lowest in eight weeks. All 33 industry
groups on the gauge rose. The Nikkei 225 jumped 2.2 percent to
13,660.55.  “The currency is showing that investors are moving away
from their previous risk-averse positions, and that’s breeding a
sense of security in the equity markets,” said  Naoki Fujiwara ,
Tokyo-based chief fund manager at Shinkin Asset Management Co.,
which oversees the equivalent of $6.5 billion. “If the  Federal
Reserve  begins tapering amid global economic strength, then the
markets are going to take it positively. Japanese shares aren’t
extremely cheap, but the Nikkei 225 in the 13,000 range is a
good price to buy.”  Yen Weakens  The yen weakened today to touch 99.14 per dollar, which put
it on course for the lowest close since Aug. 1, before  Bank of
Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda speaks tomorrow at the Federal
Reserve’s annual monetary conference in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .  Toyota, which gets 75 percent of its sales outside of
 Japan , advanced 2.8 percent to 6,220 yen today, the most since
Aug. 2.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , which counts  North America  as its
biggest sales market, rose 2.5 percent to 3,730 yen. Sony Corp.,
which gets 68 percent of its sales abroad, jumped 3.2 percent to
1,966 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.2 percent
today. The measure rose 0.9 percent yesterday after data showed
improvement in global manufacturing and the American labor
market. The Nasdaq Composite Index gained 1.1 percent following
a three-hour trading halt on the Nasdaq Stock Market after a
computer error.  Manufacturing Improvements  Manufacturing data yesterday from China to  Germany  added to
signs of a global economic recovery.  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics’ flash purchasing
managers’ index of preliminary China manufacturing data
unexpectedly rose to 50.1 for August, from 47.7 in July.  A
measure of German manufacturing compiled by  Markit Economics 
climbed to 52 in August from 50.7 in July, beating the 51.1
estimate of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Among other shares that rose, Amada advanced 5.3 percent to
769 yen, the third-biggest advance on the Nikkei 225 and closing
at its highest level since May 29. The company may see its half-yearly operating profit surge 150 percent from the same period a
year earlier to 4.5 billion yen amid a recovery in the U.S.
manufacturing industry, the Nikkei newspaper reported today,
without citing anyone.  The Topix yesterday declined below its 50-day and 100-day
 moving average . It traded at 1.19 times book value today,
compared with 2.44 for the S&P 500 and 1.71 for the Stoxx Europe
600 Index yesterday.  Technical Rebound  “Investors are buying with an eye on a technical rebound
after the recent weakness,” said Hiroaki Hiwada, a strategist
at Toyo Securities Co. in Tokyo. “The market’s focus remains on
the details of tapering of stimulus from the U.S. and will
likely remain within a limited trading range for the time
being.”  Among stocks that fell, Tokyo Electric Power dropped 4.9
percent to 508 yen, the biggest drop on the  Nikkei 225  and its
lowest close since June 6. The government demanded stronger
tanks for storing the more than 300,000 tons of contaminated
water on its Fukushima site, an amount that is growing by 400
tons a day.  Just 2.3 billion shares  traded hands  on the first section
of Japan’s stock exchange today, below the 3.5 billion average
for 2013 as investors take summer vacations. The measure’s 30-day historic volatility was at 26.6 today, compared with its
five-year median of 19.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
