J Trust Co. (8508) , the Japanese financial
services firm that completed a record stock rights offer last
month, plunged 11 percent to the lowest in six months after its
shares fell below the offer’s strike price.  The  shares  closed at 1,627 yen today, the lowest since Feb.
27, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange after slipping as much as 22
percent. That’s the biggest intraday drop since July 22, 2010.
The benchmark Topix  Index (TPX)  gained 2 percent.  J Trust, on May 14 said it planned to issue 63.1 million
shares at 1,800 yen apiece, giving shareholders one new share
for each share owned. Last month, it raised 97.7 billion yen
($988 million) selling the securities to finance  takeover  bids
in  Japan ’s biggest-ever rights offer.  “The shares’ dip below the strike price of 1,800 yen for
the rights offering likely prompted investors to cut losses and
fueled the selloff,” said Masamitsu Ohki, a  fund manager  at
Stats Investment Management Co.  Tokyo-based J Trust acquired bankrupt consumer lender
Takefuji Corp. last year, beating Seoul-based A&P Financial Co.
The Korean consumer finance company is seeking 2.13 billion yen
in damages from J Trust related to its takeover of Takefuji,
according to Japan Finance Ministry filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
