Billionaire Roman Abramovich’s
Ervington Investments Ltd. bought a stake in  Clean Air Power
Ltd. (CAP) , a U.K.-based developer of technology that allows diesel
truck engines to run on cheaper, cleaner natural gas.  Ervington and Zara Shvidler, the wife of Abramovich’s
friend Eugene Shvidler, each bought about 1.5 percent in Clean
Air Power, the company said today in a statement. Clean Air
raised about 5 million pounds ($7.8 million) before expenses
with the sale of 51.9 million shares at 9.625 pence a piece,
representing about 22.7 percent of the Lancashire, northern
England-based company.  John Mann , a spokesman for Abramovich’s Moscow-based
investment company Millhouse LLC, confirmed the acquisition
today by phone.  Clean Air makes systems that allow heavy-duty  diesel
engines  to operate mainly on natural gas, which produces less
pollution. Clean Air will use proceeds from the sale to boost
business in the U.S. and Russia, where demand for natural gas
vehicles is increasing, driven by industry plans to expand gas
refueling networks, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
