President James Bullard, who has backed the Fed’s $85 billion in
monthly bond buying, said the central bank should take time to
assess the U.S. economy and inflation before reducing the pace
of bond purchases.  “I don’t think we have to be in any hurry,” Bullard said
today in a CNBC interview from Jackson Hole,  Wyoming .
“Inflation is running low and we have got mixed data on the
economy.”  “So I’d be cautious,” said Bullard, who votes on
monetary policy this year. “We want to take our time and assess
what’s going on before we make a move.”  Treasury yields hit two-year highs this week amid
speculation the Federal Open Market Committee will slow its bond
buying starting next month. Policy makers are debating when to
begin reducing large-scale asset purchases, which they have
pledged to maintain until the job market improves substantially.  “We can afford to be very deliberate in our decision
making,” Bullard said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
