Ethanol gained the most in more than
two years, narrowing its discount to gasoline and pushing the
corn crush spread to the highest level this year.  Gasoline’s premium to ethanol tightened 9.26 cents to 57.12
cents a gallon, the smallest since July 11, as prices in  New
York  Harbor jumped to a one-month high on speculation that
production won’t expand enough to replenish East Coast supplies.
The crush spread to corn rose by 10 cents.  “Ethanol plants are struggling to get corn, and supply in
New York Harbor is tight,” said Michael Slider, director of
business development at Fauser Energy Resources in  Oregon ,
 Illinois . “New York Harbor is pulling everything to the
right.”  Denatured ethanol for September delivery rose 13.5 cents,
or 5.9 percent, to $2.436 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the steepest gain since March 31, 2011, and the highest
price since July 19. Futures have gained 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for September delivery climbed 4.24 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.0072 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol stockpiles in PADD 1, which includes New York, were
6.22 million barrels as of Aug. 16, according to the Energy
Information Administration. That’s the lowest for this time of
year since the EIA began keeping weekly data in 2010. Total
 supply  was 16.5 million, also a record seasonal low.  “Ethanol was off to the races today with September
continuing to lead the charge as the tightness in the nearby is
looking more and more dire,” SCB & Associates LLC wrote in a
note to clients today.  Production Declining  Production has averaged 836,000 barrels this year, down 5.5
percent from a year earlier, according to data from the EIA, the
Energy Department’s statistical unit.  The corn crush spread, or the difference between a gallon
of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, rose to 63 cents, the
highest level this year based on front-month contracts. One
bushel of corn makes 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Corn for September delivery added 8 cents, or 1.6 percent,
to $4.955 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively traded December
contract advanced 5.5 cents to $4.70.  The government uses tracking certificates, known as
Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, to determine
compliance with mandates to use the fuel.  Corn-based ethanol
RINs  were unchanged at 72 cents while  advanced RINs , which cover
biodiesel and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, held at 80
cents, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol gained 3.5 cents to $2.685
a gallon in New York, 14 cents to $2.56 in Chicago, 13 cents to
$2.635 on the  Gulf Coast  and 3.5 cents to $2.66 on the West
Coast, data compiled by Bloomberg show. All the prices were one-month highs.  New York Harbor’s premium to Chicago dwindled 10.5 cents to
12.5 cents, while the Gulf’s discount to the West Coast
decreased 9.5 cents to 2.5 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
