Russian stocks  climbed for a second
day, headed for their first weekly gain in five, as crude prices
advanced and Chinese data boosted mining companies.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  rose 0.1 percent to 1,398.01 rubles as of
1:25 p.m. in Moscow. The gauge is set for five-day increase of
1.3 percent. OAO Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer, added
1.2 percent, while OAO Raspadskaya, a coal producer, traded up
2.8 percent.  Brent crude  increased 0.1 percent to $110 a barrel in
London. The oil and gas industries contribute about 50 percent
of Russia’s state revenue. Chinese foreign direct investment
rose 24 percent year-on-year to $9.41 billion in July, data
showed today.  “Russia is still bolstered by the relatively high price of
oil,” Julian Rimmer, an equities trader at CF Global Trading in
London, said by e-mail. Chinese data have “improved sentiment
among metal and mining plays and so, along with $110 Brent, this
underpins a decent chunk of the Russian market,” he said.  Companies on the Micex trade at 5.3 times average 12-month
estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 9.9 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index. The volume of shares traded on the Micex
was 30 percent below the 30-day average, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Rosneft, which has a 4.8 percent weighting in the stock
measure, advanced for a third day. The company’s Chief Executive
Officer  Igor Sechin  has acquired shares in the company and has a
0.0075 percent holding in the state-run company, according to a
regulatory filing today.  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity gauge gained 1.3 percent to
92.05 yesterday. The  Market Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest
exchange-traded fund dedicated to Russian equities, increased
1.9 percent to $26.58. The  RTS volatility index , which measures
expected swings in the  stock futures , retreated 0.9 percent
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
