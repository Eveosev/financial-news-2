Natural gas futures fell in  New York 
on speculation that waning summer heat will reduce demand for
the power plant fuel.  Gas dropped as much as 1.3 percent as parts of the East
Coast will turn cooler in early September while the Midwest will
see above-normal temperatures from Aug. 28 through Sept. 6,
Commodity Weather Group LLC said. Hot weather helped prices jump
5.3 percent in the first four days of this week.  “We saw a pretty dramatic run-up through the week,” said
Eric Bickel, an analyst at  Schneider Electric  in Louisville,
Kentucky. “While it is warmer than expected over the next
couple of weeks, we are in the back half of the summer peak.”  Natural gas for September delivery slid 3.3 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.511 per million British thermal units at 9:39
a.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Trading volume was 19
percent below the 100-day average. Prices are up 4.8 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
