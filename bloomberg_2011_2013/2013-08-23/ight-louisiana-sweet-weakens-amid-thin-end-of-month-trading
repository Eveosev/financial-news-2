Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to
domestic benchmark West Texas Intermediate fell with the arrival
of the spot trading deadline for September.  Today was the last of three days that cash-market
participants have to close their books for September, a period
typically characterized by light volume and erratic pricing.  The premium for LLS fell 50 cents to $3 a barrel over WTI
at 4:03 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium weakened 35 cents to
$2.90 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon narrowed 15 cents to $2.75 a barrel
below WTI. The discount for Mars Blend to WTI slipped by 10
cents to $2.10, while Thunder Horse dropped 25 cents to a $1-a-barrel premium to the U.S. benchmark.  The premium for West Texas Sour to WTI widened 10 cents to
15 cents a barrel.  Alaska North Slope crude and Bakken shale crude both fell
50 cents a barrel against WTI, to a $5 premium and a $5
discount, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
