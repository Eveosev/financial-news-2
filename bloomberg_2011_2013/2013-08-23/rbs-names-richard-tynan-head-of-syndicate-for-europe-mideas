Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ,
Britain’s largest government-controlled bank, named Richard Tynan as head of syndicate for Europe, the Middle East and
 Africa  to replace Myles Clarke.  Tynan will report to Richard Bartlett, head of corporate
debt capital markets and risk solutions, Edinburgh-based RBS
said today in an statement. Clarke was named chief operating
officer of the lender’s markets client board, which was formed
to help with marketing and governance in June.  RBS said in February it would further shrink its investment
bank, exiting its equity derivatives and structured retail
products businesses, amid pressure from the government and
regulators to bolster capital. The bank said last year it would
cut about 3,800 jobs at the investment bank, and sell or close
its unprofitable cash equities, mergers advisory and equity-capital markets divisions.  -- Editors: Jon Menon, Steve Bailey  To contact the reporter on this story:
