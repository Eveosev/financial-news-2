Rubber climbed to the highest level
in almost three months as a weaker Japanese currency boosted the
appeal of yen-denominated futures, and after improved data from
the U.S. to  China  improved the outlook for demand.  Rubber for delivery in January on  Tokyo  Commodity Exchange
gained as much as 2.0 percent to 271.2 yen a kilogram ($2,741 a
metric ton), the highest level for a most-active since May 29.
Futures traded at 270.8 yen at 11:40 a.m., heading for the third
weekly advance.  The yen declined to 99.1 per dollar, the lowest level since
Aug. 5, amid speculation the Federal Reserve will reduce
stimulus next month. American jobless claims fell to a five-year
low over the past month and euro zone and Chinese factory output
rose more than estimated, adding to signs of global recovery.  “Rubber drew support from the currency market and
improvement in China’s economic data,” said Takaki Shigemoto,
an analyst at research company JSC Corp. in Tokyo.  Rubber for delivery in January added 1.5 percent to 20,155
 yuan  ($3,292) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board gained 2.2 percent to 82.70 baht ($2.59) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
