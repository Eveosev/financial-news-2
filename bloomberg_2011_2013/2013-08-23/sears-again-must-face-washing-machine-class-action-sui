Sears Holdings Corp. (SHLD)  must face
consumer class-action litigation over alleged washing machine
defects, a federal appeals court in Chicago ruled after being
asked to reconsider the issue by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Consumers accused the suburban-Chicago based retailer of
selling appliances with faulty computer control systems. They
also alleged that the front-loading machines, made by  Whirlpool
Corp. (WHR)  and sold under Sears’s Kenmore brand, accumulate mold.  After the appeals court last year said consumers in six
states could pursue their claims collectively, Sears gained
Supreme Court review. The high court, having earlier rejected
class status in a case against Comcast Corp. for a lack of
common damages, asked the Chicago panel to reconsider its
ruling.  “There is a single, central, common issue of liability:
whether the Sears washing machine was defective,” U.S. Circuit
Judge  Richard Posner  said in a ruling released late yesterday
reiterating that two classes be recognized.  “It would drive a stake through the heart of the class
action device, in cases in which damages were sought,” Posner
said, “to require that every member of the class have identical
damages.”  Sears and Whirlpool “respectfully disagree,” with the
appeals court decision, Chris Brathwaite, a spokesman for
Hoffman Estates, Illinois-based Sears, said in an e-mailed
statement. The companies will again seek Supreme Court review,
he said.  The case is Butler v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 11-8029,
12-8030,  U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Seventh Circuit
(Chicago).  To contact the reporter on this story:
