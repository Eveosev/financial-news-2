A team from Westport,  Connecticut ,
advanced to today’s U.S. final at the  Little League World Series 
with an extra-inning win against Sammamish,  Washington .  Chad Knight’s run-scoring single in the seventh inning gave
Connecticut the 14-13 win and a spot in the U.S. title game
against Chula Vista, California.  Connecticut hit five home runs as it rallied from a seven-run fifth-inning deficit and forced the game into extra innings
tied 13-13. Little League games are six innings.  “We were trying just to keep our heads high,” Knight said
in a television interview. “I think that was the deepest hole
we’ve been in all year.”  The game, originally set for two days ago, was delayed
until yesterday in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, by rain.  The winner of the U.S. title contest will play either
Mexico or Japan in tomorrow’s championship game.  To contact the reporter on this story:
