Thailand ’s baht had its worst week
since December 2006 on speculation outflows from  emerging
markets  will quicken as the  Federal Reserve  prepares to cut
monetary stimulus.  Government bonds  dropped.  The currency touched a three-year low of 32.17 yesterday.
Global funds sold $917 million more of Thai bonds than they
bought this month through yesterday, and pulled a net $903
million from equities, official data show. Thailand’s National
Economic and Social Development Board cut its 2013 growth
forecast on Aug. 19 as the nation entered recession for the
first time since 2009. Policy makers were “comfortable” with a
plan to pare stimulus, minutes of the Fed’s July meeting showed.  “Funds are flowing out from emerging markets, weighing on
the regional currencies,” said  Koji Fukaya , chief executive
officer and foreign-exchange strategist at FPG Securities Co. in
 Tokyo . “The contrast is becoming clearer between the U.S.,
where the economy is recovering, and slowing growth in emerging
countries.”  The baht slumped 2.2 percent this week, the most since the
period ended Dec. 22, 2006, to 31.98 per dollar as of 3:10 p.m.
in Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency rose 0.4 percent today after the dollar’s 14-day
relative strength index versus the baht stayed above 70 since
Aug. 20. The threshold suggests to some traders the baht’s
depreciation was excessive.  “A recovery in the world’s largest economy means recovery
in external demand for emerging nations,” FPG’s Fukaya said.
“When you think about that, then recent declines probably offer
a good opportunity to buy on dips.”  Fed Minutes  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 129 basis
points, or 1.29 percentage point, this week to 7.28 percent. The
gauge rose five basis points today.  The number of American jobless claims in the month ended
Aug. 17 declined to 330,500 a week  on average , the least since
November 2007, a Labor Department report showed yesterday. Fed
officials backed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s plans to start
reducing bond buying later this year should the  U.S. economy 
improve, with a few saying tapering may be needed soon, minutes
of the July meeting showed this week.  Thailand’s gross domestic product unexpectedly decreased
0.3 percent in the three months through June from the previous
quarter, when it contracted 1.7 percent, the National Economic
and Social Development Board said Aug. 19. The agency cut its
2013 expansion forecast to between 3.8 percent and 4.3 percent
from an earlier estimate of 4.2 percent-5.2 percent.  Overseas Sales  A government report next week will show exports rose 1
percent in July after declines of 3.4 percent in June and 5.3
percent in May, according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of economists. Thailand posted a current-account deficit
every month in the second quarter, central bank data show.  Morgan Stanley is bearish on the baht’s outlook and
Citigroup Inc. is underweight on the currency, according to
research reports published yesterday. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.
cut the currency’s three-month forecast to 33 per dollar from
31.3, the bank said in a note today.  The yield on the 3.625 percent sovereign notes due June
2023 jumped 22 basis points from a week ago to 4.2 percent, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s the biggest increase since
the five days ended June 21. The rate declined three basis
points from yesterday’s close that was the highest since the
securities were issued in 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
