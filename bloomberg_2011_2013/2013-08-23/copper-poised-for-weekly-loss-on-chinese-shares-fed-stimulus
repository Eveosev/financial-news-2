Copper headed for the first weekly
decline since July after shares in  China  retreated and as
economic data supported the case for the U.S. Federal Reserve to
reduce stimulus as early as next month.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange was little changed at $7,322.50 a metric ton at 3:55
p.m. in  Tokyo  after swinging between a gain of 0.2 percent and a
0.6 percent drop. It’s down 1.1 percent this week.  Industrial metals followed the Shanghai Stock Exchange
Composite  Index (SHCOMP)  lower as the gauge slid as much as 1.8 percent.
U.S. jobless claims over the past month dropped to the lowest
since November 2007 and the Fed is likely to begin to reduce
bond buying next month, according to 65 percent of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug. 9-13. China and the U.S. are the
biggest metals consumers.  “Copper gave up its earlier gain after China’s stock
market dropped in afternoon trading,” said Hwang Il Doo, a
trader at Korea Exchange Bank Futures Co. in Seoul. Concern that
the U.S. central bank will soon taper stimulus also put pressure
on the market, he said.  Futures for delivery in December on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange declined 0.1 percent to 52,690  yuan  ($8,608) a ton.
Metal for delivery in December was little changed at $3.337 a
pound on the Comex in  New York .  On the LME, aluminum, nickel, zinc, lead and tin all
declined.  To contact the reporter on this story:
