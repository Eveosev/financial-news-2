The investigation of an alleged
conflict of interest by a U.S. State Department contractor
reviewing the proposed Keystone XL pipeline won’t be complete
until January.  The State Department’s Office on the Inspector General
announced today that it was reviewing whether recommendations it
made in a separate February 2012 report into conflict questions
about another Keystone contractor are being followed as the
department conducts an environmental review of the $5.3 billion
project.  That review won’t be completed until January, Douglas
Welty, a spokesman for the watchdog agency, said in an e-mail.
The inspector general’s office earlier this month said it opened
an inquiry into allegations made by Friends of the Earth and
other Keystone critics that ERM Group Inc., which is writing the
supplemental impact statement, has financial ties to  TransCanada
Corp. (TRP) , Keystone’s sponsor.  The results of this inquiry and the review on whether
recommendations regarding the transparency of the permitting
process will be released in one report, Welty said in an
interview.  He referred questions about whether the review would delay
a decision on the Keystone project to the State Department,
which issued a statement saying it is “committed to a rigorous,
transparent and efficient federal review” of the project.  The agency has jurisdiction over the proposed pipeline to
link Canadian  oil sands  to refineries on the U.S. Gulf of  Mexico 
because it crosses an international border.  To contact the reporter on this story:
