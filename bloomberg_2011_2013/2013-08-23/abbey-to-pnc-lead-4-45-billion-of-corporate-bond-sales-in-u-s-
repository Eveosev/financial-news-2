Sales of corporate bonds in the U.S.
fell to $4.45 billion this week, the slowest period in more than
a month, as relative yields widened.  Abbey National Treasury Services Plc, a U.K. unit of  Banco
Santander SA (SAN) , issued $1 billion in its largest dollar offering
in more than two years, and Pittsburgh-based  PNC Financial
Services Group Inc. (PNC)  raised $750 million, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offerings fell from  $19.3 billion  last
week and were the least since $1.3 billion in the five days
ended July 5.  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds
rather than government debentures rose to 223 basis points
yesterday from 221 basis points on Aug. 16, according to the
Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate & High Yield Index.
Yields increased to 4.28 percent from 4.19 percent, and compare
with a record low 3.35 percent on May 2.  Abbey National issued 3.05 percent securities due August
2018 with a spread of 155 basis points, Bloomberg data show. The
sale was its biggest dollar offering since April 2011.  The debt traded at 99.6 cents on the dollar to yield 3.15
percent at 8:49 a.m. in  New York  today, according to Trace, the
bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority.  PNC, the second-largest U.S. regional bank, sold 1.3
percent notes due October 2016 to pay a relative yield of 62
basis points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded yesterday at
par, Trace data show.  Sales of investment-grade debentures, which account for the
entire portion of bonds sold this week, compare with $14.6
billion last week and a 2013 weekly average of  $22.2 billion ,
Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
