Afren Plc (AFR) , a U.K.-based oil and gas
company focused on West Africa and  Iraq , will increase output in
Kurdistan once a pipeline export route to Turkey is completed by
the end of this year.  “The pipeline is a positive step and we’ve agreed a tie-in,” Chief Executive Officer Osman Shahenshah said in a
telephone interview. “The plan is to increase production
substantially.”  Afren is selling 2,500 barrels of crude a day into the
domestic market on trucks in the semi-autonomous northern Iraqi
region, Shahenshah said. It maintained its guidance for full-year production for the whole company at 40,000 to 47,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day.  Output in the first half was 47,653 barrels a day, up 13
percent from a year earlier. The company will have to install a
new platform in  Nigeria , probably in the fourth quarter, and
that will temper production, Shahenshah said. The timing of the
shutdown still isn’t certain and may be pushed back into next
year. The company declined to give guidance on production in
2014.  Profit after tax from continuing operations fell 39 percent
in the first half to $62 million. The Shares dropped 2.8 percent
in London to 141.8 pence as of 8:50 a.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
