Corn futures in South Africa fell
following a drop in the U.S. price yesterday on speculation that
wet weather is increasing the chances for bumper crops in the
North American country, the world’s biggest producer.  White corn for delivery in December, the most active
contract, fell 0.6 percent to 2,350 rand ($230) a metric ton,
the most since Aug. 14, by the midday close on the South African
Futures Exchange. The yellow variety for delivery in the same
period, dropped 0.7 percent to 2,212 rand a ton.  As much as 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain will fall
in parts of Iowa and  Illinois , the largest U.S. producers of
corn and soybeans, National Weather Service data show. U.S.
farmers probably will harvest a record 13.8 billion bushels of
corn this year, according to government forecasts.  “Corn in the U.S. was down a little as the Pro Farmer crop
tour indicated very good corn yields for the top producing
states of Iowa and Illinois,” Brink Van Wyk, a trader at
Trademar Futures (Pty) Ltd., said in an e-mailed response to
questions. “Some rain fell in their corn area.”  Corn futures for December delivery fell 3.9 percent to
settle at $4.6450 a bushel by yesterday’s close on the Chicago
Board of Trade, the biggest decline since June 28.  South Africa is the continent’s largest producer of the
grain. Meal made from white corn is used as one of the nation’s
staple foods, while the yellow variety is mainly used as animal
feed.  Wheat for December delivery, lost 0.3 percent to 3,366 rand
a ton, the most since Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
