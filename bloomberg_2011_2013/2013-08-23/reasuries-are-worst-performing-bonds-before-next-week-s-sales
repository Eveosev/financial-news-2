Treasuries rose, pushing yields down
from two-year highs, after a report showed purchases of new U.S.
homes plunged in July, tempering speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will slow its bond-buying program as soon as next month.  Benchmark  10-year yields  had touched the highest level
since July 2011 after Fed minutes released this week showed most
officials are comfortable with a plan to start reducing bond
purchases if the economy improves. Three Fed regional bank
presidents differ over the timing for reducing the Fed’s $85
billion in monthly bond buying as the U.S. prepares to sell $98
billion of notes next week.  “We haven’t had a lot of weak news,” said  Brian Edmonds ,
the head of interest-rates trading in  New York  at  Cantor
Fitzgerald , one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed.
“Post the big trade-off, I’m not surprised we’ll see some kind
of a bounce.”  The U.S.  10-year yield  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 2.82 percent at 5 p.m. in New York, after
touching 2.92 percent, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader
prices. The benchmark 2.5 percent note due in August 2023 rose
19/32, or $5.94 per $1,000 face value, to 97 8/32.  The yield climbed to 2.93 percent yesterday, the highest
since July 2011. It is still below its average of 3.54 percent
in the past decade.  U.S. securities due in 10 years and longer tumbled 3.7
percent this month through yesterday, the biggest decline among
G-7 nations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies.  Short Positions  Treasury trading volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , dropped 9.6 percent to
$334.6 billion from $370 billion yesterday. The figure is down
from a 2013 high of $662 billion reached on May 22 and up from a
low of $148 billion on Aug. 9. The 2013 average is $313.5
billion.  Volatility as measured by the Merrill Lynch Option
Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was at 99.79, after touching 103
yesterday, the most since July 8. The average for 2013 is 68.9.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators decreased
their  net-short position  in 10-year note futures in the week
ending Aug. 20, after raising short bets the previous week to
the most since July 2012, according to U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data.  Bond Reversal  Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 24,840 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade, down from 66,432 contracts in the week ending
Aug. 13. Net-short positions fell by 41,592 contracts, or 63
percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report.  In 30-year bond  futures , traders reversed from a net-short
position to a net-long position, after holding a net short
position since June. Long positions, or bets prices will rise,
outnumbered short positions by 15,934 contracts.  Treasuries rose today after  sales  of newly built homes
declined 13.4 percent to a 394,000 annualized pace, the weakest
since October, following a 455,000 rate in the prior period that
was lower than previously estimated, Commerce Department figures
showed. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg
called for a decrease to 487,000. The drop was the biggest since
May 2010.  “There was complacency in the market and the housing
number was a catalyst that shook that complacency out at a time
when a lot of long-term investors were already seeing value at
the higher yield levels,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and
head of Treasury trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp.  Fed Presidents  Three Fed presidents differed over the Fed’s stimulus
program, with one backing a tapering next month if the economy
remains strong, and two others saying policy makers should take
time to assess economic data.  “We can take our time” on slowing purchases, St. Louis
Fed President  James Bullard , who holds a vote on policy this
year, said in a Bloomberg Radio interview from  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming .  San Francisco ’s  John Williams  told CNBC he wants to
“taper our purchases later this year” if the economy doesn’t
flag, while Atlanta’s  Dennis Lockhart  said he “would be
supportive” of slowing purchases next month if the expansion
holds up.  Market Expectations  The Fed’s debate over when to taper $85 billion in monthly
bond buying has roiled financial markets around the world and
sparked a selloff in fixed-income assets. The central bank is
buying $45 billion of Treasuries and $40 billion in mortgage
bonds each month. U.S. policy makers next meet on Sept. 17-18.  Primary dealers, those companies that underwrite the  U.S.
debt , predict the Fed will reduce the pace of its asset
purchases in September by $15 billion, to $70 billion a month, a
July survey showed.  “The Fed has been the largest distorter of yield levels
and you’ve had a few years of the market not wanting to fight
the Fed,” said Guy Haselmann, an interest-rate strategist in
New York at primary dealer  Bank of Nova Scotia. (BNS)   The U.S. central bank has kept its target for overnight
lending between banks at  almost zero  since December 2008.  Fed Vice Chairman  Janet Yellen  will moderate a discussion
at a Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, tomorrow.  Ben S.
Bernanke  will be the first Fed chairman since 1988 to pass up
attending the meeting.  Debt Auctions  The U.S. government is scheduled to sell $34 billion of
two-year notes on Aug. 27, $35 billion of five-year securities
the following day and $29 billion of seven-year debt on Aug. 29.  The U.S. is cutting the two-year auction by $1 billion, the
first reduction after selling $35 billion of the securities each
month since October 2010. The five- and seven-year auctions have
been unchanged since 2010.  The Treasury said on July 31 it expects to gradually
decrease coupon auction sizes during the coming quarter as the
nation’s fiscal health improves. The  federal budget   deficit  for
July was $97.6 billion, bringing the total for fiscal 2013,
which ends Sept. 30, to $607.4 billion. It was the lowest figure
for that stage of a fiscal year since 2008.  To contact the reporters on this story:
