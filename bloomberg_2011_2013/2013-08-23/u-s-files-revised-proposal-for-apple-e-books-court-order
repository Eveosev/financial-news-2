The U.S.  Justice Department  agreed
to reduce the duration of a court order aimed at stopping Apple
Inc. from engaging in anticompetitive conduct in the e-book
publishing industry to five years from 10.  In a filing today in federal court in New York, the Justice
Department also insisted on an external monitor and a ban on
similar conduct in other markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
