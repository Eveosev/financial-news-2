General Motors Co. (GM) , which opted
against advertising during the  Super Bowl  this year, will return
to marketing the Chevrolet brand during the  National Football
League ’s championship game in February.  The automaker is planning a new Super Bowl ad push on Fox,
which will air the game, as it introduces 18 new or refreshed
vehicles this year, including 13 Chevrolets.  “The timing of Super Bowl XLVIII lines up perfectly with
our aggressive car and truck launch plans,” Tim Mahoney,
Chevrolet global chief marketing officer, said in an e-mailed
statement today. “The Super Bowl is a great stage for
showcasing the Chevrolet brand and our newest cars and trucks.”  GM’s return to the Super Bowl marks another reversal of
advertising strategy created under ousted former Chief Marketing
Officer  Joel Ewanick . The executive, who left the Detroit-based
automaker in July 2012, had also eschewed advertising on
Facebook, the world’s most popular social-networking website.  Ewanick was ousted over the cost of a sponsorship deal with
the Manchester United soccer team, people familiar with the move
said at the time. Once he was gone, GM began undoing many of his
decisions, including advertising during the Super Bowl pre-game
programming this year and announcing in April a return to paid
Facebook ads, using the social network’s mobile applications and
website.  -- Editors: Niamh Ring, James Callan  To contact the reporters on this story:
