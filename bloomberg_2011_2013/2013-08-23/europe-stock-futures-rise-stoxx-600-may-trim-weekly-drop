European stocks  advanced for a
second day, trimming the biggest weekly decline in two months,
as euro-area  consumer confidence  and U.K. economic growth
exceeded forecasts.  Glencore Xstrata Plc and Rio Tinto Group led gains in
mining companies. FLSmidth & Co. A/S rallied the most in more
than 2 1/2 years as the maker of cement production lines
announced job cuts. Croda International Plc rose 4.3 percent as
Deutsche Bank AG upgraded the maker of cosmetics ingredients.  The Stoxx  Europe  600 Index climbed 0.4 percent to 304.71 at
the close of trading in  London , as a European Central Bank
official said the euro area’s improving economy has removed the
need to cut  interest rates  further. The equity benchmark has
still lost 0.5 percent this week, the most since June 21, amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will start paring its bond-buying program as soon as next month.  “We’re seeing a more risk-on attitude at the moment,
although volumes are still thin,” said Espen Furnes, who helps
oversee $75 billion as a  fund manager  at Storebrand Asset
Management in Oslo. “The resurrection of Europe is a theme that
is getting more and more attention. You see that most clearly in
the increasing optimism towards the periphery.”  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 was 12 percent lower than the 30-day average, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Consumer Sentiment  Euro-area  consumer sentiment  rose to the highest level in
two years in August, European Commission data showed today. The
index of household confidence increased to minus 15.6 from minus
17.4 in July. The  median forecast  of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had called for minus 16.5.  U.K.  gross domestic product  increased 0.7 percent in the
second quarter from the previous period, when it rose 0.3
percent, the  Office for National Statistics  said in London. That
compared with an initial estimate of 0.6 percent.  ECB Governing Council Member Ewald Nowotny said late
yesterday that good economic reports from the  euro zone  mean the
central bank has no reason to lower  interest rates  further from
their record low of 0.5 percent.  Releases this month have shown German manufacturing
expanded at a faster-than-expected pace in July, while the  gross
domestic product  of the 17 countries in the euro area increased
in the three months through June, following six quarters of
contraction.  FTSE, DAX  National benchmark indexes advanced in 15 of the 18 western
European markets today. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 climbed 0.7 percent,
 Germany ’s DAX increased 0.2 percent and  France ’s CAC 40 added
0.3 percent.  A gauge of mining companies was among the  best performers 
in the 19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600. Glencore rose 1
percent to 317 pence and  Rio Tinto , the world’s second-biggest
mining company, added 0.8 percent to 3,069 pence. Anglo American
Plc advanced 1.3 percent to 1,524.5 pence.  FLSmidth surged 9.8 percent to 320.80 kroner, the biggest
jump since November 2010. The company said it will cut 1,100
jobs and close down more than 20 global locations in an effort
to reduce costs, after second-quarter earnings trailed analysts’
projections.  “The cost-cutting programme is more aggressive than we
expected,” Nordea Bank AB analyst Patrik Setterberg wrote in a
report.  Croda climbed 4.3 percent to 2,677 pence after Deutsche
Bank raised its recommendation on the world’s second-biggest
maker of cosmetic ingredients to buy from hold, saying it
expects sales growth to improve in the second half of the year
and 2014.  ING Gains  ING Groep NV rose 2.4 percent to 8.78 euros after Morgan
Stanley raised its rating on the shares to overweight, similar
to buy, from equal weight, saying the Dutch lender’s net-interest margin is likely to increase.  Bachem Holding AG (BANB)  rallied 3.4 percent to 46.95 Swiss francs
after the maker of pharmaceutical ingredients reported first-half net income of 10.4 million francs ($11.3 million), from 7.3
million francs a year earlier.  Yara International ASA (YAR) , the largest publicly traded maker
of nitrogen fertilizer, slipped 2.8 percent to 250.60 kroner.
Deutsche Bank AG cut its rating on the shares to sell from hold,
saying it expects supply and demand in the global urea market to
weaken in the second half of the year and beyond.  To contact the reporter on this story:
