Taiwan dollar  forwards declined this
week after overseas investors pulled money from the island on
concern the  Federal Reserve  will soon cut stimulus that has
buoyed emerging-market assets.  Global funds sold $333 million more Taiwanese shares than
they bought this week, taking net sales this month to $1.9
billion, according to exchange data. Fed policy makers were
“comfortable” with a plan to scale back asset purchases this
year as the world’s largest economy improves, according to
minutes of their July meeting released on Aug. 21.  One-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.1 percent this
week to NT$29.895 per dollar as of 4:38 p.m. in Taipei, after
advancing in the previous two periods, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The contracts gained 0.2 percent today.  “So much money is leaving  Asia ,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
currency trader at  Union Bank of Taiwan (2838)  in Taipei. Should the
island see more fund outflows, “the Taiwan dollar can weaken
beyond $30. But the central bank won’t let it weaken too much
because it may affect inflation.”  Industrial production  rose 2.1 percent in July from a year
earlier, beating all 16 economists’ estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  In the  spot market , the local dollar weakened 0.2 percent
since Aug. 16 to NT$30.053 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei
Forex Inc. prices show. It was trading 0.5 percent stronger 18
minutes before the 4 p.m. close today, and closed up 0.3 percent.
The central bank has sold the currency in the run-up to the
close on most days since March 2012, according to traders who
asked not to be identified.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 was
little changed this week and today at 1.17 percent in Taipei,
according to Gretai Security Market prices.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, climbed 51 basis points
since Aug. 16 to 3.98 percent. The  overnight interbank lending
rate  was unchanged from a week ago at 0.385 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
