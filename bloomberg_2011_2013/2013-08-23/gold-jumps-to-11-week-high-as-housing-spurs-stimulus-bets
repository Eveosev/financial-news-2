Gold jumped to a 11-week high,
topping $1,400 an ounce in spot trading, as sales of new U.S.
homes fell more than forecast, boosting speculation that the
 Federal Reserve  will maintain economic stimulus.  Sales of newly built homes in July plunged more than 13
percent, the most in more than three years, government data
showed today. The 394,000 annualized pace compared with a drop
to 487,000 forecast by analysts in a Bloomberg survey. Fed
policy makers said they are “broadly comfortable” in scaling
back debt purchase if the economy strengthens.  “The new home-sales data tells us that all is not well
with the economy, and the Fed needs to continue to support
growth,” Tom Power, a senior commodity broker at R.J. O’Brien &
Associates in   Chicago , said in a telephone interview. “The
housing recovery is an important thing that the Fed will be
looking at when it makes its decision on the timing of the
tapering.”  Gold for immediate delivery rose 1.5 percent to $1,396.30
at 3:55 p.m.  New York  time. Earlier, the price reached
$1,400.38, the highest since June 7.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for December
delivery reached $1,399.90 after settling at $1,395.80, up 1.8
percent.  Asian Demand  This week, futures advanced 1.8 percent, the third straight
gain, partly on signs that demand for jewelry, bars and coins is
increasing in  Asia . The World Gold Council estimates that sales
will reach as much as 1,000 metric tons this year in both China
and  India , the world’s largest buyers.  Gold futures have dropped 17 percent this year, entering a
 bear market  in April, as some investors lost faith in the metal
amid an equity rally and low  interest rates .  Gold climbed every year since 2001. The metal rose 70
percent from December 2008 to June 2011 as the Fed pumped more
than $2 trillion into the financial system by purchasing debt.  Platinum futures for October delivery rose 0.1 percent to
$1,541.60 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Earlier,
the price reached $1,548.50, the highest since April 10.  In 2013, demand will outpace supplies for the second
straight year, partly as strikes by workers in  South Africa , the
biggest producer, and rising costs curb output, according to
Barclays Plc.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 3 percent to
$23.781 an ounce on the Comex. After the settlement, the price
reached $24.145, the highest since May 9. Trading was 50 percent
above the average for the past 100 days for this time, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  This week, the metal advanced 1.8 percent, the fifth
straight gain and the longest rally since September.  Palladium futures for September delivery fell 0.6 percent
to $750.85 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
