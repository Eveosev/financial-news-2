American Homes 4 Rent (AMH)  yesterday
fired a group of workers, with a focus on acquisition and
construction staff, after the housing landlord reported a fiscal
second-quarter loss, according to a person with knowledge of the
terminations.  The company, owner of almost 20,000 single-family homes,
has cut about 15 percent of its workforce this year, including
an earlier round of terminations before its initial public
offering last month, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. The Malibu,
California-based company, which raised $705.9 million in the
IPO, had a net loss of $14 million, or 15 cents a share, on
revenue of $18.1 million in the quarter ended June 30, according
to a statement this week.  Single-family landlords have struggled to turn a profit
while acquiring homes faster than they can fill them with
tenants.  Hedge funds , private-equity firms and real estate
investment trusts have raised more than $18 billion to purchase
more than 100,000 rental houses in the past two years. American
Homes 4 Rent, founded by B. Wayne Hughes, is the largest single-family landlord after Blackstone Group LP’s Invitation Homes,
which has spent more than $5 billion on 32,000 homes.  American Homes 4 Rent executives Peter Nelson, Jack
Corrigan, Sara Vogt-Lowell and Janice Stack didn’t respond to e-mails and telephone messages seeking comment on the firings.  The company’s  shares  fell as low as $15.97 after the
firings were reported, and were at $16 at 1:43 p.m. in  New York .
Trading began July 31 at $16 a share.  ‘Complete Shock’  Craig Smith , 55, a property-compliance inspector from
Columbus,  Ohio , said he received a termination notice after nine
months with American Homes 4 Rent. Smith, who earned about
$50,000 a year, said he saved the company money by finding more
than $7,000 in invoice errors last month alone.  “It’s a complete shock,” he said in a phone interview.
“I was out working and they called me to the office and told me
I was cut.”  Single-family landlords are seeking to take advantage of
prices that fell as much as 35 percent from their 2006 peak and
increased demand for rentals. The U.S. homeownership rate is at
its lowest level in 18 years, and more than 7 million homes have
been sold for a loss or lost to foreclosure since 2007,
according to RealtyTrac.  American Homes 4 Rent had 684 employees, according to a
July filing. That included 244 employees dedicated to property
management, marketing, leasing, financial and administrative
functions; 262 people overseeing renovations; and 178 people
working to identify, inspect and acquire homes.  ‘Capital Available’  The landlord is slowing its property purchases, with plans
to spend as much as $100 million a month on 800 to 1,000
additional homes, Corrigan, the company’s chief operating
officer, said on an Aug. 21  earnings  conference call.  “As far as being able to put money to work, I mean we
could easily ramp back up to $300 million-a-month pace if we
have clarity that we would have that capital available,” he
said. “But we don’t want to get too far out over our skis.”  American Homes 4 Rent owned 19,825 properties for an
investment of $3.4 billion as of July 31, according to its
earnings statement. About 56 percent of the company’s homes were
leased as of June 30.  The company had $921.4 million of cash and cash equivalents
as of the end of June.  American Homes 4 Rent raised $75 million in additional
stock sales along with last month’s IPO. The IPO’s underwriters
also plan to exercise an option to buy 6.6 million more shares
for $106 million, Chief Executive Officer David Singelyn said on
the earnings call. The company had planned to raise $1.25
billion in its IPO, according to an initial prospectus in June.  To contact the reporters on this story:
