Xing AG (O1BC)  rose to a record on
speculation that  LinkedIn Corp. (LNKD)  may buy the German provider of
online business-networking services.  The shares gained as much as 13 percent, the steepest
intraday increase since the stock started trading in December
2006. Xing traded 7.9 percent higher at 76.75 euros as of 2:47
p.m. in Frankfurt, valuing the company at 419 million euros
($559 million). Xing and LinkedIn declined to comment.  “There are rumors that LinkedIn is preparing a bid to
acquire Xing,” Alexander Braun, a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Montega AG, said by phone today.  A takeover would require Mountain View, California-based
LinkedIn to persuade Hubert Burda Media Holding GmbH to reduce
its  52.6 percent  stake in Hamburg-based Xing. The German
company, which traditionally managed print publications, is
focusing more on digital businesses and Xing is a strategic
investment for them, Braun said.  “It is unrealistic that Burda will sell unless the sum of
the bid is absurdly high,” the analyst said.  Burda first acquired 29.4 percent of Xing’s stock in 2009
and raised its stake to 59.2 percent in December 2012, prompting
speculation among analysts about a possible bid by LinkedIn.
Burda sold a 6.6 percent stake to an institutional investor in
February.  “The share price of Xing is extremely expensive for
LinkedIn to step in right now,” Marcus Silbe, a Frankfurt-based
analyst at Close Brothers Seydler Research AG said by phone
today.  Xing shares have doubled in the past year. Trading volume
today was more than quadruple the three-month daily average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
