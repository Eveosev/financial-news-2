Cotton  imports  by  Pakistan , the
world’s fourth-biggest grower, may tumble this year as a jump in
stockpiles help counter a potential drop in local output.  Inbound shipments may drop 40 percent to 1.5 million bales
of 170 kilograms (375 pounds) each in the year that began on
July 1, Khalid Abdullah, the nation’s cotton commissioner, said
in an interview in Karachi. Inventories have almost doubled to
1.5 million bales from 800,000 bales a year earlier, he said.  Cotton climbed 12 percent this year in New York, the
second-best performer among the 24 commodities tracked by the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, as farmers from the U.S. to
 Australia  reduced plantings after prices plunged from a record
in 2011, while mills boosted purchases in  China , the world’s
biggest user and importer. The contract for delivery in December
rose 0.2 percent to 84.37 cents a pound on Ice Futures U.S. at
1:28 p.m. in  Singapore .  Pakistan may miss a target to harvest 13.26 million bales
this year after excessive monsoon rains flooded some fields,
Abdullah said. “Achieving the target for the year seems
challenging now because of the rains,” he said.  Monsoon flooding has killed 165 people, while also
destroying crops on 634,200 acres (256,652 hectares ) as of
yesterday, according to the country’s  National Disaster
Management Authority .  To contact the reporter on this story:
