The U.S. Federal Trade Commission
said it will examine allegations that  oil companies  may be
undermining efforts to distribute renewable fuels.  The FTC will “evaluate” concerns that oil companies are
blocking the distribution of renewable fuels by requiring
retailers to carry premium gasoline, commission chairwoman Edith Ramirez said in  a letter  released today by two U.S. lawmakers
who had called for an inquiry.  Senators  Charles Grassley , an Iowa Republican, and  Amy Klobuchar , a Minnesota Democrat, earlier this month asked the
 Justice Department  and the FTC to investigate whether oil
companies are violating federal antitrust law by blocking the
introduction of higher ethanol blends of gasoline.  “We have heard allegations that the oil industry is
mandating retailers to carry and sell premium gasoline, thereby
blocking the use of the current retail infrastructure to sell
renewable fuel,” the senators said in an Aug. 2 letter calling
for the FTC to investigate.  Ramirez said her agency would “make every effort to
identify, prevent and prosecute practices in petroleum and other
markets that violate any statute or rule that the agency
enforces,” according to the Aug. 19 letter released by the
senators.  “The allegations are a distraction from the fact that the
renewable fuels standard is broken,” Reid Porter, a spokesman
for the American Petroleum Institute, the Washington-based group
that represents oil and gas producers, said in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
