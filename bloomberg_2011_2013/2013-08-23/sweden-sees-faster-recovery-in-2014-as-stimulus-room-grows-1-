Sweden ’s government said the largest
Nordic economy will expand faster than previously estimated next
year as it steps up stimulus plans ahead of 2014 elections.  The $540 billion economy will grow 1.2 percent this year
and 2.5 percent in 2014, compared with July forecasts of 1.3
percent and 2.1 percent, respectively, the  Finance Ministry  said
today in a statement handed out in Harpsund, south of  Stockholm .  “We will use the strength of our public finances to
energize and support a recovery,” Finance Minister  Anders Borg 
said. “We’ll maintain safety margins. Laying a firm foundation
for recovery is key to driving unemployment down.”  Prime Minister  Fredrik Reinfeldt  last week pledged his
fifth round of income-tax cuts since taking power in 2006. The
 economy  shrank 0.1 percent in the second quarter, the first
contraction in more than a year, as Sweden’s exporters struggled
with falling demand from the debt-laden euro area.  Borg said today that the government in total has 25 billion
kronor ($3.8 billion) for tax cuts and other measures next year.  The government is forecasting a weaker recovery than the
Riksbank, which in July predicted growth of 1.5 percent this
year and 2.8 percent in 2014. First Deputy Governor Kerstin af
Jochnick said yesterday the economy is “heading in the right
direction” amid “bright spots” in  Europe  and the U.S.  Rates Hold  Sweden’s central bank last month kept its benchmark rate
unchanged at 1 percent and predicted it would remain here until
the second half of next year to allow the recovery to unfold.  The euro zone surfaced from a record-long recession last
quarter, expanding for the first time since 2011. Data in
Sweden, home to Volvo AB, the world’s second-biggest truckmaker,
has sent mixed signals, with  consumer confidence  rising to a
two-year high last month as unemployment slid to 7.8 percent,
the lowest since June last year.  Unemployment will rise to 8.2 percent this year from 8
percent in 2012 and then decline to 8.1 percent next year, the
government predicted.  Inflation (SWCPYOY)  will slow to 0.1 percent this
year and accelerate to 0.9 percent in 2014.  The  budget deficit  will be 1.5 percent of  gross domestic
product  in 2013, compared with July estimates for 1.3 percent,
the government said. Both are within the European Union’s 3
percent threshold. State debt will rise to 42.2 percent of GDP
this year and to 42.7 percent in 2014, the government said.  Sweden, which is AAA rated, is tapping into its fiscal
strength this year with about 25 billion kronor ($3.9 billion),
or about 0.7 percent of GDP, in extra stimulus measures.
Initiatives include investments in infrastructure, education,
research and a cut in corporate taxes to 22 percent from 26.3
percent.  Krona Gains  Reinfeldt last week outlined 16 billion kronor in tax cuts
for income earners and pensioners next year.  Exporters have also struggled with a surge in the krona,
which last year emerged as a haven from Europe’s debt crisis.
The krona traded little changed at 8.7079 against the euro,
paring some earlier gains, as of 3:45 p.m. in Stockholm after
rising 25 percent since the start of 2009.  Sweden’s government came to power in 2006 in a bid to
reduce unemployment mainly through tax cuts. It’s trailing the
three-party opposition, led by the  Social Democrats , in polls
ahead of the country’s next parliamentary elections in September
next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
