West Texas Intermediate crude was
little changed in New York after climbing the most in almost two
weeks as signs of an improving U.S. jobs market bolstered the
economic outlook in the world’s biggest oil user.  Futures gained as much as 19 cents in New York, trimming
the biggest weekly decline in four weeks.  Jobless claims  in the
month ended Aug. 17 fell to 330,500 a week on average, the least
since November 2007, the Labor Department said yesterday. Libya
said it will resume oil exports from Brega, one of four ports
where it declared force majeure this week, as protests that shut
the facilities since end-July eased.  WTI for October delivery was unchanged at $105.03 a barrel
in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange at
9:54 a.m. Sydney time. The volume of all futures traded was
about 70 percent below the 100-day average. The contract rose
$1.18, or 1.1 percent yesterday, the biggest gain since Aug. 9.
Prices are down 2.3 percent this week.  Brent for October settlement advanced 2 cents to $109.92 a
barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
European benchmark crude was at a premium of $4.87 to WTI
futures, unchanged from yesterday.  Libya produced 800,000 barrels a day of crude last month,
half the rate a year earlier, according to a Bloomberg survey of
output from the 12-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries. It holds  Africa ’s largest oil reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
