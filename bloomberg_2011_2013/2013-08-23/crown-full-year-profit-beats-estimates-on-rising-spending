Crown Ltd. (CWN) , the Australian casino
company controlled by billionaire  James Packer , reported profit
that beat analyst estimates as high rollers placed more bets at
its domestic gaming tables. The shares rose to a record.  Net income  fell 23 percent from a year earlier to A$396
million ($357 million) in the 12 months ended June, the
Melbourne-based company said in a statement today. The result
beat the A$386 million average of  six analyst estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg.  Crown has expanded its main gaming floor in the Western
Australian state capital of Perth and is advancing plans to
build a A$1.3 billion casino on the shores of Sydney Harbour.
The market value of its Macau venture,  Melco Crown Entertainment
Ltd. (MPEL) , has  more than doubled  over the past 12 months amid a  16
percent increase  in gaming revenue in the territory in the year
through June.  Crown’s Melbourne and Perth casinos are “premium assets
that can deliver solid earnings growth,” Sam Theodore, an
analyst at UBS AG in Sydney, wrote in a note to clients last
month. There’s “potential upside” from the Sydney resort that
is expected to be ready in 2018, he wrote.  Crown rose 6.9 percent to A$14.52 as of 10:42 a.m. in
Sydney trading, headed for the highest level since its listing
in December 2007. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200 index gained 1
percent.  Crown’s board is also proposing to change the company’s
name to Crown Resorts Ltd., it said in a statement. It will seek
approval from shareholders for the name change in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
