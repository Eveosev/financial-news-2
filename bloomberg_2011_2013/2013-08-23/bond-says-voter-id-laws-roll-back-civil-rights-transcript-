Civil rights leader Julian Bond, who
participated in the March on  Washington  50 years ago and is a
chairman emeritus of the NAACP, said in an interview on
Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with  Al Hunt ,”
airing this weekend, that Republican-enacted voter-identification laws are rolling back  voting rights  for blacks
and other minorities that the late  Martin Luther King Jr . fought
so hard to achieve.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot

pioneers, Julian Bond. Julian, 50 years ago, you were here for
Dr. King’s famous “I Have a Dream” speech. Did you know then
that you were - you were at one of the most historic moments and
speeches in American history?  JULIAN BOND: I don’t think the people who drove from
Atlanta with me up here had any idea that this was going to be
what it turned out to be. We knew this was important. We knew
there were hundreds of thousands of people here. We had no idea
how many, until the newspapers told us the next day. But we had
some inkling this was going to be a big deal.  HUNT: So it also was different than some expected. First of
all, it wasn’t just a black march on Washington. It was a very
interracial crowd.  BOND: Right.  HUNT: There was a lot of apprehension beforehand.  BOND: Enormous apprehension. The government of the  District
of Columbia  at the time took - went to extraordinary ways to
make sure nothing happened. They expected riots. They expected
mayhem. They turned out the Army. They turned out the Navy. They
turned out - in five of the military bases surrounding
Washington, they had the troops on alert. They canceled elective
surgery in D.C. They -  HUNT: And then it went off without a -  BOND: Not a hitch. As I understand it, two people were
arrested that day, for rather minor things.  HUNT: August 28, 1963, what effect did that day, did that
seat, did that moment have on the turbulent and historic ensuing
years?  BOND: Well, I think for the people who came here and who
heard Dr. King firsthand and who experienced the whole day, it
was a great lift for them. And they felt, yes, what we’re doing
in the movement is right. We’re going to keep on it. We’re going
to keep on this path.  But I think for the larger countries that heard Dr. King,
it was the first time they had heard a black person give a
rationale for why the  civil rights  movement existed, why we
march, why we protest, why we picket. And it was an explanation
for that for what has been going on.  HUNT: So it set the predicate for the civil rights bills to
pass and other things -  BOND: Absolutely. It said to the nation: This is why these
people are doing this thing. Look at them. They’re white people;
they’re black people. This is an American thing. And it’s
something you ought to be involved with.  HUNT: Fifty years later, how much of Dr. King’s dream has
been realized? And what is left?  BOND: Well, it’s sort of part yes and part no. Some of it
is realized; some of it’s not. If you look at the laws
prohibiting racial discrimination, they’re in place and they’re
not likely to go away. If you look at the voting-rights
provisions, which we know the  Supreme Court  just gutted a couple
of months ago, that’s a real downer. But it’s sort of a half-full, half-empty way to look at what happens from those days to
now.  HUNT: You knew Dr. King. What do you think he would think
about the first African-American president? And how would he
assess Barack Obama’s performance?  BOND: I think he’d be tremendously overjoyed that Obama is
president and a president who was re-elected. I think he’d even
be happier with that than just the fact he was elected in the
first time. I think he’d have some mild disappointments with his
performance, not because of things he’s not done, but things
he’s not been able to do, because of the intransigence of the
Congress.  So I think it’d be, again, I love what he’s doing, I
wish he’d do more.  HUNT: Well, there are those who say he - he hesitates,
except in moments like Trayvon Martin, from talking about racial
issues. Is that a fair - is that a fair rap?  BOND: I think it’s a fair rap. But I also think he’s
constrained by conditions. And the country doesn’t want, I
think, race to be talked about a great deal, and so he’s
sensitive to that.  HUNT: But can you deal with the racial issues that still
remain without talking about them?  BOND: No, you can’t. You have to talk about it. And you
have to talk about it in an effective way, as he - he does. He -  HUNT: When he does do it.  BOND: - yes, he does very well. But I think he’s fearful of
just saying it over and over and over again. He thinks that part
of the people who elected him president don’t like that.  HUNT: He is going to speak next Wednesday at this great
site. What would you like to hear  Barack Obama  say on the 50th
anniversary of Dr. King’s speech?  BOND: I’d like to hear him say that the job is not done,
that though some things have been achieved, we ought to be proud
of those things, but we ought to realize what’s not been done,
and we ought to be on guard about the curtailment of our rights,
which we can see in these voting rights laws that are being
passed across the country to prohibit people from voting. So I
think he’d say, again, it’s a half-full, half-empty picture.  HUNT: Speaking of things that have changed, I was reading
the speeches from 50 years ago, and one of your predecessors as
the head of the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, that day - this was in 1963,
middle of - you know, the South was still in racial turmoil - he
singled out for praise the governor of  North Carolina , Terry
Sanford. It’s unlikely we’ll hear that next Wednesday.  BOND: Yes, North Carolina has become the new  Mississippi .
They’ve just taken an enormous step backward in voting rights
and a series of things because of the domination of Republicans
in the House and the Senate and in the governor’s chair. It’s
regrettable.  HUNT: And what - what places do you see that are making
progress, really? I mean, North Carolina is you say the new
Mississippi. How’s Mississippi doing? Or how are other places
doing?  BOND: Mississippi is doing better than it was back then.
But, you know, you can’t say anybody’s doing a great, great job.
A lot of states have passed these voting laws which are just
outlandish, and they suspect that there’s a level of fraud going
on in the country which no one can see. No one knows anything
(inaudible) about.  So it’s -  HUNT: Do you think they’re targeted at black voters?  BOND: Absolutely. There’s no doubt they are. You can’t
imagine that they’re targeted at anybody else. Black voters,
Hispanic voters, elderly voters, the people least likely to have
voter ID, those are the targets for these - the laws. And these
are people who are most likely to vote for the  Democratic Party .  HUNT: Yeah. You know, we in the media love to focus on
leaders and who speaks for this group. And I know we exaggerate
it always, whether it’s African-Americans or Latinos or gays.
But with that caveat, who are a couple of more important voices
today - after the president, of course - who speaks for African-American causes?  BOND: Well, I’m partial. I think Benjamin Jealous of the
NAACP is a bright new voice and young guy, Rhodes Scholar, who
speaks not only for the NAACP, I think he speaks for Americans
who are worried about the direction our country’s taking. And
there are many, many others, too numerous to mention, but they
are out there, and we’re going to hear some of them when they
gather at this podium in the future.  HUNT: Are you going to be emotional next Wednesday when you
come back here?  BOND: Oh, I’m sure so. I’m sure so. I’ll see old friends.
I’ll see people I haven’t seen in a long time. It’ll be great.  HUNT: Well, it’ll be an extraordinary moment. And you were
only 23 years old then, and I guess you’re only about 40 or 50
now, since you haven’t aged at all.  BOND: Exactly right. Exactly right.  HUNT: Julian Bond, thank you so much.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
