The Tampa Bay Buccaneers said
they’ve treated their training complex in an effort to eradicate
a staph infection that affected Pro Bowl offensive lineman Carl Nicks and kicker Lawrence Tynes.  Nicks, 28, and Tynes, 35, were both diagnosed with MRSA,
which is caused by a strain of bacteria resistant to antibiotics
commonly used to treat ordinary staph infections, such as
penicillin.  “Our primary concern is always the health and safety of
our players and staff,” Buccaneers General Manager Mark Dominik
said last night in an e-mailed statement. “Our players were
informed of the situation and we sought the advice of experts,
including the NFL’s medical adviser, who provided counsel and
approved of our comprehensive measures including the treatment
of our practice facility.”  Nicks will need five to seven days to let the medicine work
for his foot infection before he’s re-evaluated to determine how
much time he might miss, the Buccaneers said on their Twitter
feed. Tynes, the former  New York  Giants kicker who signed with
Tampa Bay last month, had surgery earlier this week on an
infected toe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
