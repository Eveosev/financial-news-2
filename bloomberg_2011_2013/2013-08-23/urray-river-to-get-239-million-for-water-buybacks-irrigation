Communities along the Murray River,
 Australia ’s longest at 2,500 kilometers (1,550 miles), will
receive A$265 million ($239 million) in government funding for
water buybacks and to help irrigation farmers adapt to using
less water to produce food.  Federal Water Minister Mark Butler and South Australia
Premier Jay Weatherill said today during a Riverland visit that
the funding would be under a Kevin Rudd Labor government for
investments over six years in more efficient crop irrigation, to
fund the river’s water recovery and sustainability measures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
