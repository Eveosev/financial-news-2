South Korea’s won headed for a
second weekly loss on signs the U.S. may cut stimulus as early
as next month. Government bonds were little changed.  Policymakers were “broadly comfortable” with a plan to
start trimming bond purchases, which have boosted the supply of
dollars, later this year if the U.S. economy improves, according
to minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee’s July meeting
released Aug. 21. Overseas funds sold $102 million more local
shares than they bought the following day, exchange data show.
South Korea’s household debt rose to a record in June, an
official report showed yesterday.  The won declined 0.5 percent this week to 1,118.98 per
dollar as of 10:02 a.m. in Seoul, the most since the period
ended Aug. 2, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency gained 0.3 percent today. One-month implied volatility,
a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price
options, rose 159 basis points, or 1.59 percentage points, to
8.42 percent this week and fell 24 basis points today.  “The FOMC minutes affirmed the market consensus that the
tapering will start as early as next month,” said Jude Noh,
chief currency trader at Suhyup Bank in Seoul. “The won and
bonds are faring better compared with other  emerging markets ,
although investor sentiment is still cautious on the possible
spillover effect.”  Foreign funds pulled $1.5 billion from Asian equities in
the week ended Aug. 21, with South Korea the only market seeing
net purchases, according to a research note today from Citigroup
Inc. analysts Markus Rosgen and Yue Hin Pong in Hong Kong.  Home loans and credit extended to households rose 1.8
percent to 980 trillion won ($875 bilion) at the end of June
from the previous quarter. Three interest-rate cuts since July
2012 have fueled the increase.  The yield on the 2.75 percent government bonds due June
2016 was steady this week and dropped one basis point today to
2.98 percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
