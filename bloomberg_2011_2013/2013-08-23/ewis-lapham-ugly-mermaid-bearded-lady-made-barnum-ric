She was not a beauty, the Feejee
mermaid, but millions paid 25 cents to enter Phineas Taylor
Barnum’s American Museum to see her.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  In fact, the mermaid consisted of a monkey’s head sewn to
the tail end of a fish. Other Barnum exhibits included Joice
Heth, a blind, paralyzed black woman, said to be the 160-year-old former nurse to  George Washington ; and General Tom Thumb,
“the smallest person that ever walked alone,” a tiny boy of
five who drank wine for the public’s amusement,  There were also bearded ladies, albinos, four-legged
chickens, educated dogs and new-fangled knitting machines.  The showman started publishing his autobiography in 1855,
and by the final revision, it was the second-most-read book in
the U.S. after the Bible.  For Barnum, people who paid for his beguiling lies got
their money’s worth. When he died in 1891, he was likely the
most famous American in the world.  I spoke with Brenda Wineapple, author of “Ecstatic Nation:
Confidence, Crisis and Compromise, 1848-1877,” on the following
topics:  1. Unsung Heroes.  2. Showmanship.  3. Civil War.  4. Age of Greed.  5. Appeasement.  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the

Time” interview series for  Bloomberg News .)  Muse highlights include Zinta Lundborg’s NYC  Weekend  and
 Greg Evans  on  movies .  To contact the writer on the story:
