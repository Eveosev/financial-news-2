Andy Pettitte  allowed one run in six
innings and the New York Yankees completed a four-game series
sweep of the Toronto Blue Jays with a 5-3 win for their 10th
victory in 12 games.  Curtis Granderson hit a solo home run in yesterdayâ€™s game,
whose start was delayed three hours, 32 minutes by rain, as the
Yankees won their fifth straight to move within 3 1/2 games of
an American League wild-card slot.  Pettitte (9-9) allowed four hits and three walks for his
254th career win. That ties the 41-year-old left-hander with
Jack Morris and Red Faber for 42nd place on the Major League
Baseball career list.  To contact the reporter on this story:
