  Xinjiang Goldwind Science &
Technology Co. (2208) ,  China ’s biggest maker of wind turbines, said
first-half profit gained 29 percent on newly installed capacity.  Net income increased to 92.7 million  yuan  ($15.1 million)
from 72.1 million yuan a year earlier, Goldwind said today in a
filing to the Hong Kong stock exchange. Sales fell 6.5 percent
to 3.23 billion yuan.  “The extensive industry experience and unique diversified
profit model provided strong support for our profitability,”
according to the statement. “Backed by strong policy support
from the government for new energy, there continues to be plenty
of room for the future development of the domestic wind power
industry.”  Goldwind joined producers including  Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) 
of Denmark in reducing expenses to counter slower growth that
has slashed margins across the industry. China may install 13
gigawatts of wind power this year, 6 percent less than a year
earlier, Bloomberg New Energy Finance estimates.  Orders under contract totaled 4,550.25 megawatts at the end
of June, and deliveries for international projects climbed to a
record 162.50 megawatts of capacity, the company said.  Goldwind fell 0.5 percent to close at HK$4.06 in Hong Kong
trading today before the earnings were announced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
