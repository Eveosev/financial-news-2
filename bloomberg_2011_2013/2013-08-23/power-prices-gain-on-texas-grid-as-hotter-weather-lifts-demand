Spot wholesale electricity gained in
 Texas  as the hottest weather in more than week bolstered demand.  The high temperature in Dallas today may be 103 degrees
Fahrenheit (39 Celsius), 7 above normal, while Houston’s reading
will climb to 100, 8 above the average, according to AccuWeather
Inc. in  State College , Pennsylvania.  Power demand  on the main state grid operated by the
Electric Reliability Council of Texas Inc. was 63,228 megawatts
at 3:32 p.m. local time, topping the  day-ahead outlook  for the
hour by 4.1 percent, according to its website.  “We are seeing some higher prices today,” Robbie Searcy,
a spokeswoman for Ercot in Austin, said in an e-mail. “With the
resources we currently have available, we don’t expect any
problems at peak today. If we lost a lot of generation, that
could change. But Friday peaks tend to drop very quickly.”  Spot prices at the Ercot North hub, which includes
deliveries to  Dallas , rose $2.23, or 4.8 percent, to $48.79 a
megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 3 p.m. local time from
the same time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Ercot expects demand to peak at 64,201 megawatts today, up
from yesterday’s high of 61,770 megawatts.  New England prices slipped as demand fell below forecasts.
 Boston  power fell $6.50, or 17 percent, to $31.27 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 4 p.m. from a day earlier.  New York  prices were up $5.29, or 16 percent, at $38.86 at
4 p.m. from the same time yesterday.  On-peak power for Boston traded at a premium of 72 cents to
 New York City , up from a discount of $1.62 yesterday, based on
full-day average prices.  Prices were little changed on the 13-state PJM
Interconnection LLC serving more than 60 million people from
Washington to  Chicago . Spot power at its benchmark Western hub
was down 58 cents, or 1.6 percent, at $36.18.  Spot power also declined in California and the Midwest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
