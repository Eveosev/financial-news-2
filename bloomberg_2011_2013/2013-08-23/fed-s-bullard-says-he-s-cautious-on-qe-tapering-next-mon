President  James Bullard , who has backed the Fed’s $85 billion in
monthly bond buying, said he would be wary of slowing asset
purchases next month.  “I wouldn’t rule it out,” Bullard told Fox Business
Network, according to excerpts released by the network. “If it
was just me, and I was dictator, I’d probably be for quite a bit
of caution here.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
