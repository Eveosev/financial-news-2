Czech President Milos Zeman is
meeting party leaders in Prague Castle as he prepares to
dissolve parliament and call early elections that could end
months of political gridlock.  Zeman said last week he would call a snap poll for Oct.
25-26 after lawmakers voted against an interim cabinet he picked
to replace Prime Minister Petr Necas’s pro-austerity government.
Necas was toppled in June by an illegal spying and graft
scandal. Parliament voted to dissolve itself on Aug. 20.  “I will tell my decision to the leaders of parliamentary
parties and ask their opinion, but I think that they will
probably not have any significant objections,” Zeman told news
website ParlamentniListy.cz yesterday.  The former opposition  Social Democrats , who have a big lead
in opinion polls, say they will increase spending to ensure the
$136 billion economy does not repeat the record-long recession
it emerged from in the second quarter. Their support fell to 21
percent this month, compared with 29 percent in June, according
to results from a PPM Factum poll released on Aug. 19.  The pro-austerity TOP09 party was in second place with 10
percent. The Communists, boosted by voter frustration at the
former governnment’s focus on cutting the  budget deficit , fell
to third place with 9 percent, from 16 percent in June.  Necas’s Civic Democrats and their ruling partners TOP09
were in fourth place with 6 percent., according to the poll
conducted among 1,002 respondents from Aug. 12-16. A margin of
error was not provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
