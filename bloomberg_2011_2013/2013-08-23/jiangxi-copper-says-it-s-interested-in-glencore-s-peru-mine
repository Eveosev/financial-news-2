Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) , China’s largest
producer of the metal, is interested in  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN) ’s
copper mine in  Peru , company secretary Pan Qifang said.  “We are collecting information about the project,” Pan
said today in a phone interview. “The study is in early stages.
We are still in internal discussion whether we’ll bid for it.”  MMG Ltd. (1208) , the Hong Kong-listed unit of China Minmetals
Corp. and Chinalco Mining Corp. International are among other
groups considering bidding for the Las Bambas copper mine,
people with knowledge of the matter have said. Glencore is
selling the project as part of an agreement to obtain Chinese
regulatory approval for its $29 billion takeover of Xstrata Plc
this year.  Pan declined to comment on whether Guixi, Jiangxi province-based Jiangxi Copper may team up with another company to bid for
the project. The possible bid was reported earlier by Reuters.  The Las Bambas mine is scheduled to produce 400,000 metric
tons of copper a year starting in 2015 for at least the first
five years. Xstrata said in January it was building the mine at
a cost of $5.2 billion.  The agreement with China requires Glencore to pursue the
sale of Las Bambas to a buyer approved by the country’s Commerce
Ministry by Sept. 30 next year. The sale price will be the
higher of two scenarios -- either an evaluation by two
independent investment banks, or the total of all costs incurred
by Glencore and Xstrata at the project, according to Glencore.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
