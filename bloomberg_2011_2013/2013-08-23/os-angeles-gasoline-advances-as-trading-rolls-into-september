Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles  gained
against futures for the first time in seven days after trading
on the prompt-month contract rolled into September delivery.  The discount for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles narrowed 21.75 cents against futures traded on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  to 3.25 cents a gallon at 4:08
p.m., data compiled by Bloomberg show. Prompt delivery jumped
12.34 cents to $2.8382 a gallon, a one-week high.  The delivery month for spot Carbob in Los Angeles rolled
into September today and is now trading against October Nymex
gasoline futures, which settled more than 13 cents a gallon
below the September contract today.  The discount for Los Angeles Carbob widened to a record
against September futures yesterday after supplies of the fuel
climbed to 5.81 million barrels last week, the most for the
period since at least 2004, according to data compiled by the
 California Energy Commission .  Retail gasoline  in California fell 1.2 cents to average
$3.819 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA, the nationâ€™s
largest motoring organization, said on its website.  Carbob in  San Francisco  widened its discount to futures by
2 cents to 3.5 cents a gallon. The contract in the Northern
California city rolled into September yesterday.  Conventional gasoline in  Portland , Oregon, a benchmark for
the U.S. Pacific Northwest, strengthened 4 cents against futures
to a discount of 13 cents a gallon.  The  3-2-1 crack spread  of Alaska North Slope crude, Carbob
in Los Angeles and California-grade diesel in Los Angeles,
widened for the first time in three days, broadening $2.69 to
$11.50 a barrel at 4:12 p.m.  New York  time. The spread, a rough
indicator of refinery profitability, shrunk to a 2013 low
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
