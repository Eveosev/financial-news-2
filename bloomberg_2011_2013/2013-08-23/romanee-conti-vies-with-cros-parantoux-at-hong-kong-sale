Three magnums of Romanee-Conti Grand
Cru 1969 and 10 bottles of Henri Jayer’s Vosne-Romanee Premier
Cru 2001 Cros Parantoux are among top Burgundies up for sale at
a Christie’s International Plc auction in  Hong Kong  this month.  The Romanee-Conti magnums carry a top estimate of
HK$450,000 ($58,000) and the Cros Parantoux HK$380,000, while a
12-bottle case of La Tache Grand Cru 2005 is priced to fetch as
much as HK$300,000, according to Christie’s online catalog.  The auction on Aug. 31 comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50
Index of top Bordeaux vintages has risen 4 percent this year,
with a drop since mid-March erasing half of its gain of 8
percent in the first 10 weeks of the year. As the index heads
for its fifth straight month of declines, investor appetite at
auctions has been driven by older Burgundy vintages while demand
for Bordeaux has been inconsistent.  “Bordeaux may not be back in fashion with buyers just yet,
but it would seem that beyond the Gironde, the wine market is
thriving,” the Liv-ex wine exchange wrote in its market
commentary blog this week.  Other leading Burgundies in the sale include three bottles
of Romanee-Conti Grand Cru 2003 estimated to fetch as much as
HK$300,000, two bottles of the same producer’s 2007 vintage with
a top estimate of HK$160,000 and eight bottles of Montrachet
Grand Cru 1990 priced to sell for as much as HK$280,000.  Cheval Blanc  Top Bordeaux in the auction include a case each of Chateau
Petrus Pomerol from the 1990 and 1989 vintages, estimated to
sell for as much as HK$350,000 and HK$280,000 respectively, and
a three-bottle lot of Chateau Cheval Blanc 1947 Saint-Emilion,
with a top estimate of HK$300,000, according to the Christie’s
catalog.  The Romanee-Conti vineyard in Vosne-Romanee is slightly
smaller than 2 hectares (5 acres) and has its own appellation as
a Burgundy grand cru wine. The rarity of its wines regularly
makes them the highest-priced lots at auctions.  Jayer’s Cros Parantoux, from a 2.5-acre premier cru
vineyard that was an artichoke field in World War II, has also
acquired trophy status, with a case of the 1985 vintage fetching
as much as HK$2.06 million at a Christie’s sale in Hong Kong in
February 2012. Jayer, who died in 2006, has become one of
Burgundy’s most sought-after wine-makers.  Here is a list of global wine auctions scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
