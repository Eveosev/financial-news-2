EverBank Financial Corp. (EVER)  will make
$37 million in cash payments to past mortgage borrowers to
settle claims it improperly handled foreclosures, the Office of
the Comptroller of the Currency said in a statement.  With the agreement, EverBank joins 14 other loan servicers
that struck similar deals with the OCC and Federal Reserve this
year, including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Bank of America  Corp. and
 Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) â€™s GMAC Mortgage, which settled last month.
EverBank will send payments ranging from $1,050 to $125,000 to
32,000 eligible borrowers, the OCC said in the statement today.  Settlements reached since January with 15 of the largest
U.S. mortgage servicers, totaling more than $3.8 billion, will
close the books on complaints over mishandled foreclosures after
the 2008 credit crisis. The deal with Jacksonville, Florida-based EverBank ends a process the company agreed to in 2011 to
have individual foreclosures reviewed for harm.  The company also agreed to pay about $6.3 million to groups
that provide help with affordable-housing and foreclosure
assistance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
