Moody’s Corp. (MCO)  won dismissal of a
lawsuit by a pension fund claiming the credit ratings firm made
false statements about its independence and objectivity.  U.S. District Judge George B. Daniels in Manhattan found
that the Teamsters Local 282 Pension Trust Fund failed to
establish that Moody’s violated securities laws, according to a
ruling issued today.  The pension fund, an investor in New York-based Moody’s,
argued the company succumbed to conflicts of interest when it
assigned faulty ratings to structured securities products before
the financial crisis.  The fund alleged that Moody’s stock dropped after questions
arose about the mortgage-backed securities and other products
the firm had rated highly. In about 2007, Moody’s and other
ratings companies began downgrading those securities.  “Plaintiffs must proffer some evidence demonstrating that
Moody’s specific alleged misrepresentations caused the
materialization of the risk that Moody’s rating practices were
unsustainable,” Daniels wrote. “They fail to do so.”  The case is In re Moody’s Corporation Securities Litigation,
07-8375, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
