Hong Kong   stocks  rose, with the
benchmark index paring its biggest weekly loss in two months, as
stronger economic data from the U.S., Europe and China bolstered
the global outlook.  The  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  gained 0.6 percent to 22,025.55 as of
9:33 a.m. in Hong Kong. The equity benchmark is heading for a
2.2 percent drop this week as outflows from  emerging markets 
accelerated and the  Federal Reserve  signaled in the minutes of
its July meeting that it will start tapering asset purchases
this year if the world’s biggest economy continues to improve.  The  Hang Seng Index  retreated 3.4 percent this year through
yesterday, the worst performer among developed markets tracked
by Bloomberg, on concern China’s growth is slowing. The gauge
traded at 10.4 times estimated earnings yesterday, compared with
14.9 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Futures on the  S&P 500  rose 0.2 percent today. The gauge
gained 0.9 percent yesterday in New York as U.S. jobless claims
fell to a five-year low over the past month and factory output
in China and Europe expanded more than estimated.  The number of jobless claims in the month ended Aug. 17
declined to 330,500 a week on average, the least since November
2007, a Labor Department report showed yesterday in Washington.
The Fed will begin to curtail bond buying next month, according
to 65 percent of economists surveyed by Bloomberg from Aug.
9-13.  Deutsche Bank AG raised China’s second-half growth forecast
to 7.7 percent from 7.6 percent after HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics yesterday released preliminary data indicating
unexpected manufacturing growth. Their purchasing manager’s
index for Germany increased to 52 this month from 50.7 in July.  China Shares  The Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index, also known as the  H-share index , climbed 1.2 percent to 10,083.64 today. The gauge
fell 18 percent from a Feb. 1 high through yesterday and traded
at 1.2 times book value, compared with a five-year average of
1.8.  Materials and energy producers led declines this year on
the Hang Seng Composite Index amid concern weaker expansion in
China will sap demand. Information-technology, services and
utility companies were the biggest gainers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
