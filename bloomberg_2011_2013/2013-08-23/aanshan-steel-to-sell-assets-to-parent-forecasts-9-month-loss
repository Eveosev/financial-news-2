Maanshan Iron & Steel (600808)  Co., Hong
Kong’s second-largest listed steelmaker, said it will sell
stakes in some assets to its parent for 3.84 billion  yuan  ($627
million) and forecast a nine-month loss.  The sale of port, international trading, transportation and
machinery units and land, will “help boost liquidity and reduce
financial costs,” the Maanshan, Anhui province-based company
said in a statement. The company expects to book a 918.2 million
yuan gain from the sale, it said.  Maanshan yesterday reported a narrowed first-half loss of
332.8 million yuan, compared with a loss of 1.89 billion yuan a
year ago. The steelmaker is  on course  for its second annual loss
as industry overcapacity weighs on prices.  The first-half result “was better than our expectation,”
Barclays Plc analyst Ephrem Ravi said in an e-mailed note today.  Maanshan Steel jumped 3.9 percent to HK$2.16 at 10:36 a.m.
in  Hong Kong , set for the highest since March 13. Earlier it
advanced as much as 7.2 percent.  The company will incur losses for the first nine months of
this year as the cost of raw materials increased faster than
steel prices, it said in a separate statement, without
elaborating. Maanshan may have a loss of 390.6 million yuan in
2013, according to the average of 16 analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
