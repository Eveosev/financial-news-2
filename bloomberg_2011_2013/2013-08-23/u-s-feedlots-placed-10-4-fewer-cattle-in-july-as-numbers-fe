U.S. feedlots reduced the number of
cattle added to their herds by 10.4 percent in July amid tight
animal supplies after the worst drought since the 1930s spurred
higher feed costs.  About 1.722 million  head  of cattle were moved into feedlots
last month, down from 1.922 million in July 2012, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a report. Thirteen
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a 1.6 percent
drop, on average. The feedlot herd totaled about 10 million as
of Aug. 1, down 5.9 percent from a year earlier. Analysts
expected a 4.2 percent slump.  The cattle industry still hasn’t recovered from last year’s
drought. The cattle herd on July 1 was the smallest for that
date since at least 1973, according to the average of four
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. imports of Mexican
feeder cattle as of Aug. 10 are down 46 percent this year
compared to a year earlier, USDA  data  show. Lower placements are
the result of these tighter numbers, according to Vetterkind
Cattle Brokerage.  “I just don’t think the cattle are out there,” Steve Wagner, a market analyst for CHS Hedging Inc. in St. Paul,
 Minnesota , said in a telephone interview before the report.
“Producers are a little bit leery about putting in expensive
cattle.”  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old cattle that weigh
about 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders.
The animals are fattened on corn until they weigh about 1,300
pounds, when they are sold to meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 2 million animals to meatpackers last
month, up 4.5 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected a 4.4 percent gain, on average.  Cattle futures for October delivery rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.27225 a pound at 9:06 a.m. on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. The price was down 3.9 percent this year
through yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement fell 0.3
percent to $1.57275 a pound, and the commodity gained 2.2
percent this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
