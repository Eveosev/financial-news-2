D.E Master Blenders 1753 NV (DE) , the
Dutch coffee company being acquired by Joh. A. Benckiser,
reported 12-month sales growth at the bottom of its forecast
range as demand declined in western Europe.  Sales in the period through June were unchanged at 2.65
billion euros ($3.54 billion), excluding acquisitions,
disposals, green-coffee exports and currency shifts, the
Amsterdam-based company said in a statement today. Master
Blenders predicted an increase in February of 0 percent to 2
percent, a reduction from a previous forecast range of 3 percent
to 5 percent growth.  JAB, the investment arm of the billionaire Reimann family,
said April 12 that it agreed to buy Master Blenders, the maker
of Douwe Egberts, for about 7.5 billion euros to build a coffee
conglomerate in the industry’s biggest deal ever. The
transaction was initially subject to shareholders who control 95
percent of the company tendering their stock. The minimum
acceptance was lowered to 80 percent after an investor vote.  Oak Leaf BV, a company owned by a JAB-led investor group,
said Aug. 16 that shareholders acceptance was 89.7 percent and
extended the offer period by four weeks to Sept. 17.  The 12-month  underlying operating margin  at Master Blenders
widened by 180 basis points to 13.8 percent, the company said
today. That exceeded the coffee producer’s forecast of a 100- to
150-point improvement. Net income increased 48 percent to 196
million euros.  Master Blenders reduced its 2013 sales and profitability
forecasts in February amid increasing pressure on prices in
Europe. The company is in the final phase of an 18-month fiscal
year as it shifts to a January-to-December reporting period
starting in 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
