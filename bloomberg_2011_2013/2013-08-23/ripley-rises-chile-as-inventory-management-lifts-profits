Ripley Corp SA (RIPLEY)  advanced for the
first time in five days after the company reported a 40 percent
increase in second-quarter profit, citing inventory management
improvements at its stores.  Ripley,  Chile ’s third-largest department store operator,
 advanced  3 percent to 422.5 pesos at 1:26 p.m. in Santiago. A
close at that level would be the highest since July 4. The
country’s benchmark IPSA index gained 0.7 percent.  The company, which also has stores in Peru and  Colombia ,
posted second-quarter net income of 9.61 billion pesos ($13.5
million), compared with 6.9 billion pesos in the same period
last year, according to a regulatory  filing  after the close of
trading yesterday. Better inventory management and a focus on
selling its own clothing brands helped boost the margin on
earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization to
8 percent from 6.9 percent, Ripley said.  “The strong growth was chiefly attributable to a more
efficient company,” Banco Santander analysts Cristian Jadue,
Reinaldo Santana and Tobias Stingelin, wrote in an e-mailed note
to clients today. “We expect a favorable market, as results
surpassed expectations, thus supporting our positive view of the
stock.”  Banco Penta, BICE Inversiones, BTG Pactual and Corp
Research SA, also said that results surpassed expectations.
Banchile-Citi, the joint research department of  Banco de Chile (CHILE) 
and Citigroup Inc., raised its recommendation on Ripley to buy
from the equivalent of hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
