Stanford economist Robert Hall presented the  first paper  at this morning's monetary policy confab in Jackson, Wyoming, and while he touched on a number of topics, one stood out because it reflects deep misunderstandings about the banking system. Hall writes: This startling argument has two parts, both of which are wrong. First, banks don't lend reserves. Reserves aren't needed for lending, and creating additional reserves doesn't make banks more likely to extend credit to households and businesses. But don't take my word for it. James Tobin, the legendary Yale economist,  explained  all this half a century ago. William Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York,  made the case  even more forcefully back in May: The second problem with Hall's argument is that he ascribes too much importance to the minimal 0.25 percent interest rate that the Fed pays on reserves held by commercial banks. I'll defer to Paul Krugman, who  demolished  a similar argument a few weeks ago. Krugman notes that the Bank of Japan paid no interest on reserves during its asset-purchase programs yet was as incapable of increasing the quantity of broad money as the Fed. Moreover, the amount of  currency in circulation  has increased sharply over the past five years, even though the Fed pays no interest on pieces of paper with pictures of old white men on them. One might think that Hall would recommend liquidating those darned interest-bearing reserves so that they could stop retarding the recovery. Yet at the end of the paper, he concludes by warning that the Fed must resist "the intensifying pressure to raise interest rates and contract its portfolio well before the economy is back to normal." Maybe if I could make sense of all those contradictions I, too, could be a tenured professor. (Matthew C. Klein is a writer for Bloomberg View.  Follow  him on Twitter.)
