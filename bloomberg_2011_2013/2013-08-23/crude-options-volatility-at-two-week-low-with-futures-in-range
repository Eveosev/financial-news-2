Crude oil options volatility fell to
a two-week low as crude futures remained within a seven-dollar
trading range that has lasted seven weeks.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
October was 20.65 percent on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at
4 p.m., down from 21.51 percent yesterday. Itâ€™s the lowest level
since Aug. 7.  West Texas Intermediate crude for October delivery gained
$1.39 to settle at $106.42 a barrel on the Nymex. Prices climbed
the most in two weeks on housing data that led to speculation
the  Federal Reserve  may defer stimulus tapering. Front-month
futures have traded between $102.22 and $109.32 since July 9.  The most active options in electronic trading today were
October $95 puts, which fell 10 cents to 12 cents on volume of
5,160 lots as of 4:07 p.m. October $96 puts were second-most
active, declining 13 cents to 15 cents on 3,722 contracts.  Puts made up 61 percent of electronic trading volume. In
the prior session, bearish bets accounted for 59 percent of the
94,147 contracts exchanged.  June $80 puts were the most-active options yesterday with
6,578 lots exchanging hands as they fell 8 cents to $1.76 a
barrel. June $90 puts fell 18 cents to $3.96 on volume of 4,000
contracts.  Open interest was highest for December $80 puts, with
40,030 contracts. Next were December $90 puts with 36,220 lots
and December $105 calls with 34,839.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  To contact the reporter on this story:
