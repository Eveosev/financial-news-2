Bank of America Corp. (BAC)  said it began
a review after 21-year-old intern Moritz Erhardt died one week
before completing a summer program in  London .  The bank has “convened a formal senior working group to
consider the facts as they become known, to review all aspects
of this tragedy,” John McIvor, a bank spokesman in London, said
in an e-mailed statement today. Erhardt “was popular among his
peers and was a highly diligent intern at our company with a
bright future.”  Erhardt, who was on a seven-week pre-graduate program, died
last week, Bank of America said earlier this week. The death is
being treated as non-suspicious, a spokesman for the
Metropolitan Police in London said then.  Erhardt was found unconscious at  Claredale House , a student
residential facility in East London. He was pronounced dead at
the scene after being treated by paramedics, said the police
spokesman, who asked not to be identified, citing agency policy.  In addition to  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America’s investment-banking division, Erhardt also had work
experience at KPMG Consulting, Morgan Stanley and  Deutsche Bank
AG’s (DBK)  corporate-finance division, according to his biography page
on social-network site seelio.com.  He was a former exchange student at the  University of
Michigan ’s Stephen M. Ross School of Business and attended WHU -
- Otto Beisheim School of Management in Vallendar, Germany,
according to his profile page.  To contact the reporter on this story:
