The  European Central Bank ’s pledge
to keep its benchmark  interest rate  on hold for an “extended
period” isn’t aimed at driving up inflation, said Frank Smets,
the ECB’s director general for research.  “This is not a promise to be irresponsible, not a promise
to generate higher inflation,” Smets told the  Federal Reserve 
Bank of Kansas City’s annual symposium in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.
“Instead, the forward guidance is really meant to clarify both
the assessment of the ECB of the current subdued outlook for
inflation” and inform investors about what it’s looking for to
guide its decision making.  President  Mario Draghi  began issuing guidance in July to
quell an increase in financial-market borrowing costs and
protect an economic recovery that only began in the last
quarter.  On whether European rates can decouple from the U.S. when
the Federal Reserve unwinds stimulus, Smets said he believed the
ECB could steer long-term interest rates through standard policy
and keep them “relatively low” when adjusted for inflation,
even if the equivalent rates are climbing in the U.S.  He said forward guidance may prove more effective in the
euro area than U.S.-style asset purchases given banks have
greater influence than markets in the European economy.  When it comes time to exit its stimulus, Smets said the
ECB’s “exit is almost endogenous” because banks will return
emergency funds they received and the balance sheet will narrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
