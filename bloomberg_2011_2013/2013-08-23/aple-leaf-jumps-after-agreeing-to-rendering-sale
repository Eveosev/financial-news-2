Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (MFI) , the Canadian
food processor, rose the most in almost five years after the
company agreed to sell its animal-rendering business to  Darling
International Inc. (DAR)  for about C$645 million ($613 million).  Maple Leaf climbed 7.8 percent to C$14.44 in Toronto, the
biggest gain since October 2008.  Maple Leaf will use the sale proceeds to pay down debt, and
may use additional excess cash to reinvest in its packaged food
business or return capital to shareholders in the future, the
Toronto-based company said in a statement today. The Rothsay
rendering and biodiesel business had earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of about $85 million in
2012, according to the statement.  Darling will fund the transaction through new debt
financing, the Irving, Texas-based company said in a separate
statement.  The sale, which is expected to close by year-end, is Maple
Leafâ€™s third disposal announced this quarter, after the company
agreed to sell its commercial turkey farms and hatchery
operations to Ernald Enterprises Ltd. and Cuddy Farms Ltd.
respectively, for undisclosed sums.  Maple Leaf is in the midst of a five-year overhaul, which
began in 2010, that includes closing eight plants and cutting
1,550 jobs by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
