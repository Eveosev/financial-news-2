The  Federal Reserve  is working with
law enforcement authorities to investigate the posting of
employee data on a website today. The central bank’s critical
operations weren’t affected, the Fed said.  Individuals claiming to be part of the hacker group known
as Anonymous posted what they said were “full details of every
single employee at Federal  Reserve Bank  of America,” adding
central banks have “systematically defrauded the planet.” The
post included a spreadsheet containing phone numbers, e-mails
and other employee information that  the Fed  said today was
probably accessed more than six months ago.  The information “appears to have been obtained during an
incident first made public in February,” Jim Strader, a Fed
spokesman, said in a statement. “That vulnerability was
remediated shortly after discovery and we are confident that the
Fed’s critical operations were not affected.”  The central bank is working with  law enforcement 
authorities “to evaluate the release of names and other non-sensitive information about some employees,” according to the
statement from Strader at the Richmond Fed, which runs the
central bank’s information-technology office.  In February the Fed said it found a security breach on a
website it uses to stay in touch with banks during emergencies.
The central bank’s Emergency Communications System was accessed
by hackers, the Richmond Fed said after the breach. Banks use
the site to designate their emergency contacts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
