Azerbaijan’s united opposition named
a new candidate to challenge President  Ilham Aliyev  in Oct. 9
elections should its previous choice, Oscar-winning screenwriter
Rustam Ibrahimbayov, be barred from the race.  Camil Hasanli, a prominent historian and professor at Baku
State University, was picked as a “reserve” candidate of the
National Council of Democratic Forces, the alliance of
opposition parties said following a vote today in the Azeri
capital, Baku. The group voted 72 to 1, with one abstention, in
favor of his candidacy.  The Central Electoral Commission will probably announce
next week that Ibrahimbayov is disqualified from standing in the
election because he failed to relinquish his Russian citizenship
on time. Azeri nationals holding dual citizenship are ineligible
for the presidency. Ibrahimbayov was picked as the
representative of the country’s secular opposition last month.  Aliyev, who succeeded his father in disputed presidential
elections 10 years ago, was nominated by the ruling New
Azerbaijan Party, or YAP, last month to compete for a third term
in office. The Azeri leader’s family has run the oil-rich
 Caspian Sea  state for more than four decades.  Ibrahimbayov, also known as Ibragimbekov in the Russian
transliteration of his name, co-wrote with Nikita Mikhalkov the
1994 film “Burnt by the Sun” that won an Oscar for best
foreign language movie.  To contact the reporter on this story:
