Alistair Darling, the former U.K.
chancellor of the exchequer and transport secretary, said he now
opposes building a high-speed rail line linking  London  to
northern England, a project he approved while in office.  “Politicians are always excited by ‘visionary’ schemes,”
Darling wrote in an article for the Times newspaper today. “One
thing I have learnt is that transport, rather like banking, is
at its best when it is boring.”  Darling cited reports of rising costs and doubts about the
economic case for the line, known as HS2, which will cut journey
times and increase capacity on existing lines for freight. The
government estimates the cost of the line and trains at 50
billion pounds ($78 billion), including a 16 billion-pound
allowance for contingencies.  The Conservative and Liberal Democrat coalition partners
are committed to the project, which began under the previous
Labour government, of which Darling was a member. Labour has
said it remains committed to HS2. Andrew Adonis, the
transport secretary who drew up the plans, is advising Labour
leader Ed Miliband on economic policy.  Interviewed on BBC Radio 4 today, Darling said there are
better ways to boost the economy outside southeast  England  and
that high-speed rail risks starving the existing network of
much-needed investment.  “I’m an enthusiast for the railways but my fear is that if
you build this visionary project you’ll have a nightmare on the
rest of the network because you won’t have the money to spend on
it,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
