Ford Motor Co. (F)  overcharged
commercial truck dealers for 11 years, a lawyer said in the
retrial in a lawsuit that initially resulted in a $2 billion
judgment against the company.  “This case is about Ford breaking a contract promise it
made to treat all of its dealers equally,” Dennis Mulvihill, a
lawyer for the dealers, said today in his opening statement in
the trial in  Cleveland  state court.  Ford engaged in “a secret pricing scheme” that allowed
the company to take retail profits from dealers, he said. “They
charged dealers too much money for these trucks.”  The dealers sued Ford in 2002, claiming the company broke
an agreement to sell trucks at published prices, which forced
them to pay more from 1987 through 1998. Cuyahoga County Judge
Peter J. Corrigan in 2011 awarded $2 billion, including about
$1.2 billion in interest, to a class of about 3,000 dealers.  A state appeals court ordered a new trial last year,
finding Corrigan improperly excluded evidence that might have
helped the company. The dealers will be seeking $2 billion
again, plus additional interest, James Lowe, another lawyer for
the dealers, said in an interview before trial.  Lower Prices  The liability is “pretty clear,” Lowe said. “The
contract was breached and if not for that breach the dealers
would have gotten lower prices.”  Ford has denied any breaches or overcharging. The company
has also asked Corrigan, who will be conducting the new trial,
to reverse his 2005 decision allowing the dealers to pursue the
claims as a group.  The case is Westgate Ford Truck Sales Inc. v. Ford Motor
Co., CV 02-483526, Court of Common Pleas, Cuyahoga County,  Ohio 
(Cleveland). The appellate case is Westgate Ford Truck Sales
Inc. v. Ford Motor Co., 2012-Ohio-1942, Court of Appeals of
Ohio, Eighth Appellate District, County of Cuyahoga (Cleveland).
