Renren Inc. (RENN) , the owner of a social
media website in  China , jumped to the highest level in a week in
 New York  after selling a majority stake in its group-buying
online unit to  Baidu Inc. (BIDU)   American depositary receipts of Renren increased 6.2
percent to $3.61 at 10:29 a.m. The ADRs gained as much as 12
percent earlier. Shares of Baidu slipped 0.7 percent to $138.51,
the biggest drop in a week.  Baidu, China’s most-used online search engine, will buy
about 59 percent of social commerce website Nuomi.com from
Renren for about $160 million, according to a PR Newswire
statement. Nuomi had merchandise sales of about $120 million in
the second quarter, the companies said. The acquisition is
expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, according to the
statement.  “This divestiture is beneficial to Renren’s financial
positioning as it exits the cash-burning group buy business,”
Cynthia Meng, an analyst at Jefferies Group LLC, wrote in an e-mailed note today. “We see no fundamental change in Renren’s
core social network services business.”  Jefferies upgraded Renren to hold from a sell equivalent,
maintaining a price target of $3.3.  “The deal is expensive and will be dilutive to Baidu,”
Beijing-based 86Research Ltd. said in a note, adding it values
Nuomi at an estimated price-to-sales ratio of about 10, more
than three times  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) ’s multiple. Nuomi is unlikely to
“break even in the foreseeable future,” the note said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
