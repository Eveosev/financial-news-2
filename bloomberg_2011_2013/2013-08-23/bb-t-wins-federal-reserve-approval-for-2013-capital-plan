BB&T Corp. (BBT) , North Carolina’s second-biggest bank, won the Federal Reserve’s approval for a new 2013
capital plan after its original proposal was rejected, the Fed
said in a statement today.  BB&T’s initial capital plan was rejected in March based on
a qualitative assessment, the central bank said at the time. The
Fed’s statement today didn’t provide any information on how the
new plan differed from the earlier one.  BB&T, led by Chief Executive Officer Kelly King, 64, said
on March 4 that it had reevaluated how to calculate risk-weighted assets and determined changes were needed to meet
regulatory guidance, the Fed said when it rejected the plan on
March 14. The adjustments increased those assets and triggered a
drop in BB&T’s risk-based capital ratios, according to the Fed.  The Winston-Salem-based bank’s shares have  climbed  23
percent this year through yesterday, compared with a 27 percent
jump in the 24-company KBW Bank Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
