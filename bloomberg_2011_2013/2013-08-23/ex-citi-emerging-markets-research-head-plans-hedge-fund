Citigroup Inc. (C) ’s former global head
of emerging markets equity research, Rhys Summerton, plans to
start his own hedge fund in September with at least $20 million
of assets.  Milkwood Capital Ltd.  will be a global equity long and
short fund, taking bets on rising and falling stocks, according
to a letter to potential investors obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Summerton, 36, is putting $20 million of his own money in
the pool, while other investors have given “indications of
interest” to invest $50 million or more, he said by e-mail.  The opening comes as hedge fund startups in Europe are at a
record low, according to a study by  Bank of America Corp.  About
34 new hedge funds started in the region in the first half of
this year, down from 37 in the year-earlier period, according to
the report.  Summerton worked for more than a decade at Citigroup in
London and was head of research for central and eastern Europe,
the  Middle East  and Africa before becoming global head of the
emerging market equity research team in 2010. He left in May.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  is prime broker to Milkwood Capital, which
will be based in Ascot, England.  To contact the reporter on this story:
