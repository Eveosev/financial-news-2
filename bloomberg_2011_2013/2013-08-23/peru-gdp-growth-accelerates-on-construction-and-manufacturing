Peru ’s economic growth accelerated
in the second quarter from the slowest pace in three years in
the previous three months as construction picked up and
manufacturing rebounded.  Gross domestic product rose 5.6 percent from a year
earlier, the statistics agency said in an e-mailed statement, in
line with the  median forecast  of 13 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey and up from a revised 4.6 percent in the first quarter.
The agency had originally calculated growth in the first three
months of the year at 4.8 percent.  Slowing growth in  China  has curbed demand for Peru’s
exports and damped investor confidence in the world’s third
biggest copper producer this year. The central bank cut reserve
requirements last month to boost lending, while the government
plans to award $8.7 billion in infrastructure contracts by year-end to shore up private investment.  Peru’s construction industry expanded 15 percent in the
second quarter from a year ago, while retail rose 6.4 percent
and manufacturing climbed 3.1 percent, the agency said. Fixed
asset investment expanded 8.6 percent, compared with 6.6 percent
in the first quarter.  GDP rose 1.1 percent from the first quarter on a
seasonally-adjusted basis.  The Andean nation’s exports fell 12 percent in the first
half of 2013 from a year earlier, creating a $847 million trade
deficit, according to the central bank.  Peru’s sol was unchanged at 2.8120 per U.S. dollar at 12:54
p.m. in  Lima . The currency depreciated to a three-year low of
2.84 on Aug. 19, leading the central bank to step up sales of
greenbacks to support the local currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
