Kevin Stadler holds a one-shot lead
in the second round of the U.S. PGA Tour’s opening playoff-series event, where Tiger Woods trails by three strokes.  The first round of the Barclays tournament at Liberty
National Golf Club in  Jersey City ,  New Jersey , concluded this
morning after play was delayed twice yesterday by thunderstorms.
Of the 123 golfers in the field, 63 were unable to finish their
first rounds due to six hours of weather delays.  With the final second-round group not scheduled to tee off
until 4:39 p.m. New York time today, the opening 36 holes won’t
be concluded until tomorrow morning. Woods, in a group with
fellow Americans  Matt Kuchar  and defending FedEx Cup champion
Brandt Snedeker, has a 4:06 p.m. tee time.  Stadler had a bogey-free 7-under-par 64 yesterday that left
him one shot ahead of American  Ryan Palmer ,  Henrik Stenson  of
 Sweden  and Camilo Villegas of Colombia. Villegas was 8 under
yesterday before making back-to-back bogeys late in the round.  Kuchar finished his first round at 5 under along with Jason Day of  Australia . Woods had a 4-under 67, which included birdies
on Nos. 14, 15 and 16.  British Open winner  Phil Mickelson  was among yesterday’s
delayed afternoon starters and returned to the course this
morning with 12 holes still to play. He bogeyed the 18th hole of
his first round to be at even par, with four birdies and four
bogeys. He remained at even par through nine holes of his second
round.  Stadler’s Progress  Stadler, 33, made birdies on seven of the first 13 holes
yesterday as he seeks to continue his upward swing at the
Barclays, which rotates among a group of courses in New York and
New Jersey. Stadler, who is winless in 230 PGA Tour starts,
missed the cut for weekend play in his first four appearances at
the tournament before tying for 64th in 2011 and finishing in a
tie for 10th last year.  Woods, who’s won five  PGA Tour  events this season, leads
the FedEx Cup point standings and won the season-ending title in
2007 and 2009.  The top 125 players in the standings qualified for the
Barclays. Woods entered the tournament with a  766-point lead 
over Kuchar in the competition for the series title and its $10
million bonus.  The top 100 players on the points list following the
Barclays qualify for the  Deutsche Bank Championship  at TPC
Boston from Aug. 30 to Sept. 2. After that, the top 70 move on
to the BMW Championship outside Chicago from Sept. 12 to 15.  The top 30 in the standings then compete for the FedEx Cup
title and the $10 million bonus at the Tour Championship in
Atlanta from Sept. 19 to 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
