Ireland’s National Asset Management
Agency is preparing to sell three office buildings in central
Dublin with a combined valued of more than 100 million euros
($134 million), two people with knowledge of the plan said.  The properties are the  Bloodstone Building  in the docklands
district, Grand Mill Quay near Google Inc.’s European
headquarters and Hume House, a property in the affluent
Ballsbridge neighborhood that’s likely to be redeveloped, said
the people, who asked not to be identified because the
information is private. NAMA hasn’t decided whether to proceed
with the sale, which would be its biggest divestment in Ireland
since it was set up in 2009  Ray Gordon , a NAMA spokesman who works for Gordon MRM,
declined to comment.  The real estate market is emerging from the biggest slump
in western  Europe , led by Dublin. Income returns from office
buildings in the capital are more than 10.5 percent a year, the
highest among the cities covered by research firm Investment
Property Databank Ltd.  Downtown office values increased for the first time in six
years in the first quarter, gaining 0.3 percent from the
previous three months, IPD said in April. The average value of
properties in the docklands rose 2.2 percent, the London-based
firm said.  NAMA was set up to take on and sell real estate mortgages
purged from Ireland’s lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
