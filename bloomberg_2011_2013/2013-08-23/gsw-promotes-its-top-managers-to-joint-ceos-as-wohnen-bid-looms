GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) , the German
residential landlord that lost its chief executive officer in
July, will promote its two most senior managers to fill the
position.  Chief Operating Officer Joerg Schwagenscheidt and Chief
Financial Officer Andreas Segal will become co-CEOs, the company
said in a statement today. GSW received a takeover bid from
 Deutsche Wohnen AG (DWN)  on Tuesday that values the company at 1.8
billion euros ($2.3 billion).  Bernd Kottmann resigned as GSW’s chief in June following
investor complaints about the way he was hired. Deutsche Wohnen
CEO Michael Zahn said this week that the company took advantage
of the vacuum to make a bid for a competitor it has considered
buying since before  GSW’s initial public offering  in 2011.  The acquisition would create  Germany ’s largest property
company. Both landlords are based in Berlin, where price and
rent gains have outpaced the rest of the country. Deutsche
Wohnen owns about 90,000 apartments in large German cities
including Berlin and  Frankfurt , and GSW owns 60,000 homes in the
German capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
