NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the largest
independent U.S. electricity generator, may further expand its
clean-energy portfolio after its purchase of Energy Curtailment
Specialists Inc., an analyst said.  “We see the transaction as among a series of other
potential moves for NRG,” Julien Dumoulin-Smith, an analyst
with UBS Securities LLC in New York, wrote in a research note
today. “Other potential ‘alternative energy’ investments to
complement NRG’s retail offerings could include distributed
solar generation.”  NRG, based in Princeton, New Jersey, announced the purchase
of Energy Curtailment in a statement yesterday without giving a
price. Energy Curtailment manages more than 2 gigawatts of
demand response for at least 5,000 customers.  The deal “represents a global trend of large energy
companies adopting demand-side management business,” Brian Warshay, a Bloomberg New Energy Finance analyst in New York,
said in an interview today. Demand-response providers help power
companies better manage demand for electricity and reduce strain
on the electrical grid.  The deal follows Constellation Energy Group Inc.’s purchase
of CPower Inc. and Honeywell International Inc.’s deal
forAkuacom, both in 2010, and Johnson Controls Inc.’s 2011
acquisition of EnergyConnect Group Inc.  Avoiding peak electricity usage conserves resources for
power producers, Warshay said. “Instead of a utility flipping
on generation at a gas power plant for 200 hours a year, demand
management is almost always cheaper, and there’s lower
emissions.’”  To contact the reporter on this story:
