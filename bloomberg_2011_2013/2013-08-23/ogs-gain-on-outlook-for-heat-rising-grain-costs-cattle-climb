Hog futures rallied the most in a
week on speculation that a Midwest heat wave and higher feed-grain costs will slow U.S. pork production. Cattle prices also
rose.  Temperatures are expected to increase in the Midwest over
the next five days, according to MDA EarthSat Weather. Hot
weather tends to make hogs eat less, delaying production because
it takes longer to reach slaughter weights. The price of corn,
the main ingredient in livestock feed, is headed for its second
straight weekly gain on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  The heat “should slow the weight gains,” Doug Houghton, a
commodity analyst at Brock Associates, said in a telephone
interview from  Milwaukee . “It could to some extent slow hog
movement.”  Hog futures for October settlement climbed 0.7 percent to
85 cents a pound at 10:46 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. A close at that price would be the biggest gain since
Aug. 14.  Cattle futures for October delivery added 0.1 percent to
$1.273 a pound in Chicago.  Feeder-cattle futures for September settlement slid 0.1
percent to $1.5755 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
