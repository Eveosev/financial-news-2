Gold was little changed near a two-month high in  New York  as investors weighed expectations the
U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus against more physical
demand. Platinum reached a four-month high.  Bullion futures rose to a two-month high of $1,384.10 an
ounce on Aug. 19 and are up 0.1 percent this week. Minutes
released Aug. 21 of the Fed’s July 30-31 meeting showed policy
makers were “broadly comfortable” in slowing debt buying if
the economy strengthens.  Gold slid 18 percent this year as some investors lost faith
in the metal as a store of value. The Fed will reduce its
monthly purchases of $85 billion in bonds at its next meeting on
Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent economists in an Aug. 9-13
Bloomberg survey. The median estimate is a cut to $75 billion
each month. Bullion futures rebounded from a 34-month low of
$1,179.40 set in June as lower prices boosted demand for
jewelry, coins and bars, particularly in  Asia .  “The Fed minutes have increased expectations that stimulus
will be scaled back and that has certainly weighed on gold,”
said Lv Jie, an analyst at Cinda Futures Co., a unit of one of
four funds in  China  created to buy bad debt from banks. “Gold
remains well-bid in Asia, which should support prices.”  Gold for December delivery added 0.1 percent to $1,372.70
an ounce by 7:47 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Futures trading
volume was 48 percent below the average for the past 100 days
for this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. Gold
for immediate delivery in  London  lost 0.2 percent to $1,373.30.  ETP Holdings  Gold  exchange-traded product  holdings fell 1 metric ton to
1,947.3 tons yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Assets,
which are down 26 percent this year, reached a record in
December as central-bank stimulus increased investors’ concern
about currency debasement and accelerating inflation.  “The U.S. labor market remains the key element to the
quantitative-easing tapering future,”  Andrey Kryuchenkov , a
commodity strategist in London at VTB Capital, wrote in a
report. “Until we have some clarity on this issue, there is set
to be jittery and nervous gold trading.”  Silver for December delivery added 0.1 percent to $23.10 an
ounce in New York. Palladium for September delivery fell 0.4
percent to $752.35 an ounce.  Platinum for October delivery reached $1,546.90 an ounce,
the highest since April 10, and was last up 0.1 percent at
$1,542.30. It’s set for a fourth straight weekly gain, the best
run since January. Demand for the metal will outpace supply for
a second year in 2013, partly as labor strikes and rising mining
costs in top producer  South Africa  curb output, according to
Barclays Plc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
