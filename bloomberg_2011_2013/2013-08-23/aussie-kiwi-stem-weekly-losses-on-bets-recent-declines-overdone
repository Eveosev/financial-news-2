Australia ’s dollar maintained a gain
from yesterday against the greenback on speculation its loss
this week was excessive.  The Aussie held its climb above 90 U.S. cents after dipping
to 89.32 yesterday, the lowest in two weeks. Declines have been
fueled by increasing bets the U.S. Federal Reserve will next
month start paring back stimulus that has supported asset prices
around the world. The  New Zealand dollar  halted a four-day slide
that pushed it to a two-week low yesterday.  “I would say fair value is around these levels, and I
expect Aussie to trade between 88 and 92 U.S. cents for the next
little while,” said  Chris Weston , chief market strategist at IG
Markets Ltd. in  Melbourne . “We could see a bit of upside as
people cover shorts. Positioning is still extreme in the
Australian dollar.” A short position is a wager an asset’s
price will fall.  Australia’s currency was little changed at 90.12 U.S. cents
as of 10:12 a.m. in Sydney from yesterday. The currency has
fallen 2 percent this week. One-month volatility rose two basis
points to 12.52 percent, after reaching 12.71 percent on Aug.
21, the most since Aug. 5.  New Zealand’s dollar was unchanged at 78.30 U.S. cents from
yesterday, when it touched 78.04, the weakest since Aug. 5. It
has dropped 3.4 percent since Aug. 16, set for the biggest
weekly loss since June.  Traders trimmed record positions betting on declines in the
Aussie versus the  U.S. dollar , figures from the Washington-based
Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. The difference in
the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and other large speculators
on a drop compared with those on a gain -- so-called  net shorts 
-- was 62,721 as of Aug. 13, compared with an all-time high of
76,779 a week earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
