Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk
was reappointed as chairman of the country’s ruling party as he
seeks to reassert his leadership and tackle slumping popular
support two years before general elections.  Tusk won 79.6 percent of  Civic Platform  members’ votes,
Krystyna Skowronska, head of the party’s electoral committee,
said today at a conference in Warsaw. Turnout in the first
direct elections for party leader was 51.1 percent, she said.  Civic Platform has fallen behind the opposition Law and
Justice in opinion polls for the first time since September 2007
as the European Union’s largest eastern economy battles its
worst economic slowdown in more than a decade. Tusk became the
first Polish premier to win re-election since the fall of
communism and has led his party since 2003.  Jaroslaw Gowin, an ex-justice minister, won 20.4 percent of
party members’ votes, Skowronska said. Civic Platform has 206
deputies in the 460-seat lower chamber of parliament and runs a
majority government with the Peasant’s Party.  To contact the reporter on this story:
