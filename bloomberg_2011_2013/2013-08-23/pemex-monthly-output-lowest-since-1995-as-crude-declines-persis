Petroleos Mexicanos’ July oil
production fell to its lowest monthly level in almost 18 years
as the world’s fifth-largest crude oil producer heads toward a
ninth straight year of declining output.  Crude production dropped to 2.482 million barrels a day in
July from 2.519 million the previous month, state-owned Pemex
said today. July production was the smallest monthly output by
Pemex since October 1995, when it produced 1.898 million barrels
a day. Crude exports rose to 1.21 million barrels from 1.09
million in June.  The diminished production comes on the heels of President
Enrique Pena Nieto and his  Institutional Revolutionary Party ’s
congressional proposal on Aug. 8 to allow for private investment
in the oil sector. The proposed bill calls for the end of the
government’s monopoly on production and would allow private
companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  to pump
crude for the first time since 1938.  Pemex, the third-largest crude oil exporter to the U.S.,
has seen production plummet as output from the Cantarell field
has plunged more than 80 percent since 2004. Pemex lowered its
year-end 2013 output goal last month to an average of 2.541
million barrels a day, 0.6 percent below the company’s goal to
produce more than 2.55 million barrels this year, according to
 Carlos Morales , head of production and exploration.  Pemex reported July 26 that its second-quarter net loss
widened to 49 billion pesos ($3.87 billion) from the year-ago
period. Sales slid 3.2 percent to 393 billion pesos on lower
fuel prices and declining exports, the company said in a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
