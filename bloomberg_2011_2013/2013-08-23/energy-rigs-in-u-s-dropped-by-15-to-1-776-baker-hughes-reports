Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S.
declined by 15 to 1,776, according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  fell 15 to 1,382, the Houston-based field services
company said on its website. Gas  rigs  dropped one to 387.
Miscellaneous rigs increased by one to seven.  The  total rig count  has advanced six out of eight weeks as
producers boost their drilling programs in response to a surge
in crude prices this year and a rebound in gas futures. The
increase in output helped the U.S. meet 87 percent of its energy
needs in the first four months of 2013, on pace to be the
highest annual rate since 1985.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 5.6 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.489 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , up 25 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 57 billion cubic feet last week
to 3.063 trillion, bigger than the five-year average gain for
the week of 56 billion cubic feet, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday. Supplies were 7.2 percent below year-earlier
inventories.  U.S. oil output slipped 53,000 barrels a day to 7.52
million after hitting the highest level since December 1989 a
week earlier. Stockpiles fell a third week, losing 1.43 million
barrels to 359.1 million.  Crude for October delivery rose $1.67, or 1.6 percent, to
$106.70 a barrel today on the Nymex, up 16 percent in the past
year.  Oil production in  Texas ’s Eagle Ford shale formation rose
60 percent in June from a year earlier to 617,884 barrels of
crude a day, preliminary data released by the Texas Railroad
Commission, show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
