German  government bonds  fell for a
third day after a report showed  Europe ’s biggest economy
expanded in the second quarter, curtailing demand for the
region’s safest securities.  Ten-year bund yields rose to the  highest  in 17 months
as European Central Bank policy maker Ewald Nowotny said the
recent “stream of good news” in the euro area removed the need
to cut  interest rates . Dutch 10-year rates climbed to the most
since April 2012, while  Austria ’s reached the highest since
July 2012. Spanish and Italian bonds fell this week as Federal
Reserve minutes showed policy makers were “comfortable” with
slowing stimulus that has boosted higher-yielding assets.  “The  bond market  is moving in one direction,” said
 Michael Markovich , head of global interest-rate research at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich. “It has taken the Fed minutes
to mean that tapering is on the way. The market is being overly-optimistic on a normalization of interest rates in Europe.”  Germany’s 10-year yield rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.93 percent at 4:52 p.m. London time after
climbing to 1.98 percent, the highest since March 2012. The 1.5
percent bund due in May 2023 fell 0.105, or 1.05 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,335) face amount, to 96.20. The yield has
increased five basis points  this week .  Growth Signs  German  gross domestic product  grew 0.7 percent last quarter
after stagnating during the previous three months, the Federal
Statistics Office said, confirming a preliminary estimate
released Aug. 14. An index of euro-area  consumer confidence  rose
to minus 15.6 this month, the highest since July 2011, the
European Commission said in Brussels.  “The data confirms that the European economy is recovering
and  Germany  is the country that will be in the lead,” said
Allan von Mehren, chief analyst at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in
Copenhagen. “Nowotny has said that rate cuts are off the table
and while this shouldn’t be too controversial given the economic
improvement, at the margin it could put a little bit of pressure
on the bond market.”  Dutch  10-year yields  were little changed at 2.32 percent
after rising to 2.37 percent, the highest since April 25, 2012.
Austria’s were little changed at 2.33 percent after reaching
2.38 percent, the most since July 2, 2012.  `Good News'  ``I would not see many arguments now for a rate cut,''
Nowotny said in an interview yesterday with Bloomberg Television
in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming .   Spain’s 10-year yield fell three basis points to 4.46
percent, having risen 10 basis points this week. Similar-maturity Italian yields climbed two basis points to 4.33
percent, extending this week’s increase to 14 basis points.
Rates on both securities are headed for their first weekly
increase since the period ending July 12.  A few U.S. policy makers said ``it might soon be time to
slow somewhat the pace of purchases,'' according to the minutes
of the Federal Open Market Committee's July 30-31 meeting
released Aug. 21.  The Fed will reduce its monthly bond purchases from $85
billion at its next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65
percent of economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey. The
median estimate is for a cut to $75 billion each month.  Volatility on Dutch bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Austria and Germany,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  To contact the reporters on this story:
