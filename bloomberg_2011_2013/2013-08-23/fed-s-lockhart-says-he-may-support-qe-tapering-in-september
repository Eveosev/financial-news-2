President  Dennis Lockhart , who has backed the Fed’s $85 billion
in monthly bond purchases, said he will support a slowing in
bond purchases as long as economic reports remain strong.  “I would be supportive in September as long as the data
between now and then basically confirm the path we’re on,”
Lockhart, who doesn’t vote on monetary policy this year, said
today in a CNBC interview from  Jackson Hole , Wyoming. “I am
confident in a continuation of this sort of moderate growth
path.”  Treasury yields hit a two-year high this week amid
speculation the  Federal Open Market Committee  will slow its bond
buying starting next month. Policy makers are weighing when to
begin reducing large-scale  asset purchases , which they have
pledged to maintain until the job market improves substantially.  The  U.S. economy  will probably expand this year at a rate
ranging from 2 percent to 2.5 percent, Lockhart said.
Unemployment by the end of 2013 will probably be between 7.2
percent and 7.4 percent, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
