Carlyle Group LP (CG) , the world’s
second-largest manager of alternative assets such as private
equity, agreed to purchase German wood products manufacturer
Klenk Holz AG for an undisclosed fee.  Carlyle Strategic Partners, which manages more than $2
billion across three funds and focuses on investments in
distressed companies, will provide the capital for the purchase,
Washington-based Carlyle said in an e-mailed statement today,
without disclosing details of the transaction.  “Klenk has a firm footprint in the European building-materials market, combining strong management expertise with a
wide distribution network and well-located manufacturing,” Ian Jackson, managing director at Carlyle Strategic Partners, said
in the statement. It’s “ideally placed to benefit from the
growth in a number of European and international economies.”  Founded in 1904 by the Klenk family and headquartered in
Oberrot,  Germany , Klenk Holz employs more than 1,200 people at
three sites across its home market. The company’s products
include construction timber, laminated timber and form-work
beams and panels, according to the statement.  Carlyle Group said it had $180 billion of assets under
management across 118 funds at the end of June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
