Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , seeking a successor to Chief Executive Officer  Steve Ballmer , doesnâ€™t plan to consider co-founder Bill Gates for the role, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Gates, who is on the committee in charge of finding a new CEO, plans to stay on in his role at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, a philanthropic organization, said one of the people, who asked not to be identified because the search is private.
