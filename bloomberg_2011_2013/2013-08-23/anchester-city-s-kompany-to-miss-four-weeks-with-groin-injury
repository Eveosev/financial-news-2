Manchester City captain  Vincent
Kompany  will miss at least four weeks with a groin injury,
manager Manuel Pellegrini said on the Premier League soccer
club’s website.  The central defender limped off the field in the 71st
minute of City’s season-opening 4-0 win over Newcastle four days
ago.  “I prefer the doctor has the final word on this but I
think he will be out for at least one month,” Pellegrini said.
“Today or tomorrow we will know exactly how long Vincent will
be out for.”  City plays at Cardiff in its next Premier League match in
two days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
