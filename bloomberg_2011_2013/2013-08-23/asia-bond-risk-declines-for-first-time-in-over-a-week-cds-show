The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
dropped for the first time in more than a week, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 4 basis points to 162 basis points
as of 8:32 a.m. in Hong Kong, Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. prices show. The gauge is set for its first decline
since Aug. 14 after touching a two-month high yesterday,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 5 basis points to
123 as of 10:30 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac Banking
Corp. prices. The benchmark is poised for its biggest decrease
since July 22, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 3.5 basis points to
98 basis points as of 9:34 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The last time the measure dropped by more was on
July 12, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
