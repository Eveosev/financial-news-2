Cia. Hering (HGTX3) , Brazil’s second-biggest
clothing chain, led retailers higher as a gain in the real after
the announcement of an intervention program spurred speculation
that inflation won’t run out of control.  The shares climbed 4.1 percent to 31.54 reais at 2:22 p.m.
in Sao Paulo, the steepest advance on a closing basis since
April 23. The rally was the biggest on the MSCI Brazil/Consumer
Discretionary Index, which rose 6 percent, the most among 10
industry groups.  “It’s good news for retailers if the currency strengthens
a bit,” Sandro Fernandes, a trader at brokerage firm Geraldo
Correa, said by phone from  Belo Horizonte , Brazil. “Investors
were concerned because we already saw prices of some products
increasing as the real weakened this year. The government
intervention in the currency market fuels hope that policy
makers won’t have to raise  interest rates  too much.”  The real surged 2.7 percent to 2.3685 per dollar after the
central bank stepped up efforts to stem the worst three-month
decline among 31 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg,
announcing a $60 billion intervention program involving foreign-exchange swaps and loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
