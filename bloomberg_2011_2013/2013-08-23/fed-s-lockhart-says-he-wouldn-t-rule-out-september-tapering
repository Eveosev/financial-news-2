Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta
President  Dennis Lockhart  said he wouldn’t rule out a September
move by the central bank to start tapering its bond-buying
program as long as the economy’s performance justifies it.  “I’m looking at the data as whether they are denying or
undermining the outlook I have in my head” for moderate growth,
Lockhart said in an interview today on Bloomberg Television with
 Michael McKee  from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, where the Kansas City
Fed is hosting a conference. “You can take a cautious first
step,” which the Fed could conceivably do, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
