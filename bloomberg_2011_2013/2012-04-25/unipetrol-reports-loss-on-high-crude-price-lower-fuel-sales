Unipetrol AS (UNIP) , the biggest Czech oil
refiner, reported a first-quarter net loss as the economic
slowdown crimped sales of fuels and profitability was reduced by
higher crude  oil prices .  The net loss in the three months through March of 361
million koruna ($19.1 million) compared with a profit of 464
million koruna reported a year earlier, the Prague-based company
said today in a statement on its website. The operating loss of
51 million koruna compared with a profit of 571 million koruna.  Earnings have been squeezed by rising crude prices and
lower demand as slower growth caps consumption. The planned
outage at the Paramo refinery also reduced volumes during the
quarter.  The company expects positive earnings before interest and
tax in 2012 and plans to invest 2 billion koruna in operations
this year, according to the statement. It will continue its
“long-term trend in staffing reduction,” it said.  Crude oil throughput dropped 10 percent from the previous
three months to 906,000 metric tons, the company said. Foreign-
exchange rates boosted first-quarter earnings by about 156
million koruna, while sales of carbon allowances added more than
100 million koruna to earnings before interest and tax,
according to the statement.  Polish refiner PKN Orlen SA, which controls 63 percent of
Unipetrol shares, said today first-quarter net income rose to
1.26 billion zloty ($396 million), beating analyst estimates.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
