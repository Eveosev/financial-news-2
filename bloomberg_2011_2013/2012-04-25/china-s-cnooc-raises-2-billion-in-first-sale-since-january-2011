Cnooc Ltd. (883)  sold $2 billion of bonds
denominated in U.S. dollars in its first offering in more than a
year.  China ’s biggest offshore oil and gas explorer issued $1.5
billion of 3.875 percent, 10-year notes and $500 million of 5
percent, 30-year bonds, both at a relative yield of 190 basis
points more than similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Cnooc’s success in discovering new fields will help the
company achieve its goal of increasing annual production by as
much as 10 percent, it said in a statement. Spending increased
58 percent in the first quarter, helping the Beijing-based
company make five new discoveries, it said. Proceeds from the
bond sale will be used for general corporate purposes, according
to a company  announcement  to the  Hong Kong  stock exchange dated
April 25.  Moody’s Investors Service ranked the notes at Aa3, its
fourth-highest level of investment grade. Barclays Plc, BOCI
Asia Ltd., and Citigroup Inc. are managing the 144A/Reg S sale,
the company said in the statement to the exchange.  CNOOC last sold bonds in January 2011, issuing $1.5 billion
of 4.25 percent, 10-year notes at a spread of 100 basis points
and $500 million of 5.75 percent, 30-year debt at 120 basis
points. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
