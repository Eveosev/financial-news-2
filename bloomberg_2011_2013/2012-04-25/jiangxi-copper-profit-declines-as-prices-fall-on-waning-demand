Jiangxi Copper Co. (358) ,  China ’s biggest
producer of the metal, said first-quarter profit fell 9.6
percent as weakening demand dragged prices lower.  Net income declined to 1.43 billion yuan ($227 million), or
0.41 yuan a share, for the three months ended March 31 from 1.59
billion yuan, or 0.46 yuan, a year ago, the Guixi, Jiangxi
province-based company said today in a statement to the Shanghai
stock exchange, citing Chinese accounting standards. Sales
climbed 14 percent to 28.8 billion yuan.  China’s economy  expanded a less-than-expected 8.1 percent
in the first quarter, the slowest pace in 11 quarters, raising
concerns about demand from the world’s largest metals user.
Average copper prices in  London  in the quarter fell 14 percent
from a year earlier.  Jiangxi Copper declined 0.6 percent to close at HK$18.18
today in  Hong Kong , before the earnings announcement, compared
with a 0.2 percent drop in the benchmark Hang Seng Index. The
stock has climbed 8.3 percent this year.  The company aims to produce 210,000 metric tons of copper
concentrate from its own mines this year, an increase of 5
percent, Luo Rongjin, an analyst with Bocom International Ltd.,
said in a March 28 report. Self-mined copper is the main driver
of Jiangxi Copper’s profit, Luo said.  Copper for three-month delivery  added 0.8 percent to $8,179
a metric ton as of 5:17 p.m. Shanghai time on the London Metal
Exchange. The global copper market will achieve a basic supply-
demand balance this year, and copper prices are expected to
stabilize at about $8,500 a ton, Jiangxi Copper Chairman Li Yihuang said on March 28.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
