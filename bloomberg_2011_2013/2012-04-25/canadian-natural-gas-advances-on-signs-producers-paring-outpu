Canadian natural gas rose amid
speculation that production cuts spurred by decade-low prices
are starting to take hold.  Alberta  gas rose 8.5 percent.  Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada ’s
biggest natural-gas producer, plans to cut output to 3.1 billion
cubic feet a day this year from 3.33 billion in 2011, Chief
Executive Officer Randy Eresman said at the company’s annual
meeting. Encana expects to see prices start to recover as
drilling rig counts and production fall, he said.  “We’re starting to see signs of price improvement,”
Eresman told the meeting in Calgary. “I’m cautiously optimistic
of a price recovery later this year or early into next.”  Alberta gas for May delivery advanced 8.5 cents to C$1.58 a
gigajoule ($1.53 per million British thermal units) as of 5 p.m.
New York time on  NGX , a Canadian Internet market.  Gas traded on the exchange is shipped to users in Canada
and the U.S. and priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta system.
NGX gas is down 45 percent this year.  Natural gas for May delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  rose 9.3 cents, or 4.7 percent, to settle at $2.068 per
million Btu.  Spot gas at the Alliance delivery point near Chicago gained
1.45 cents to $2.1223 per million Btu on the  Intercontinental
Exchange . Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion
cubic feet a day from western Canada.  Spot Prices  At the Kingsgate point on the border of Idaho and British
Columbia, gas fell 3.05 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $1.8337 per
million Btu. At Malin,  Oregon , where Canadian gas is traded for
California markets, prices slipped 4.72 cents, or 2.4 percent,
to $1.9172.  Volume on TransCanada’s  Alberta system , which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 16.6 billion cubic
feet, 249 million below target.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2 billion cubic feet at
Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to TransCanada’s
main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the  Chicago  area, the
daily flow rate was 2.1 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at  Kingsgate  was 949 million cubic feet. The system was forecast
to carry 1.7 billion cubic feet today, or 64 percent of its
capacity of 2.65 billion.  The volume on  Spectra Energy ’s British Columbia system,
which gathers the fuel in northeastern British Columbia for
delivery to Vancouver and the Pacific Northwest, totaled 3.07
billion cubic feet at 4:50 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
