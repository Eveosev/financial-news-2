The lira appreciated to the
strongest level in more than seven weeks on bets the  central
bank  will introduce new measures tomorrow to combat inflation.  The lira gained 0.5 percent to 1.7711 per dollar by 5:07
p.m. in Istanbul, the highest intraday level since March 5.
Today’s rise in the lira is higher than all but two other
emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The  yield  on
two-year benchmark debt dropped one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 9.44 percent, falling for a third trading
session.  The central bank is committed to reducing inflation to 5
percent by mid-2013 and will reveal new measures on April 26,
Governor Erdem Basci said in an interview with Bloomberg HT on
April 21 on the sidelines of the  International Monetary Fund 
meeting in  Washington . The bank is due to release the inflation
report tomorrow.  “Expectations for a more hawkish stance from the central
bank have emerged in tomorrow’s meeting,”  Emre Balkeser , head
of trading at Garanti Investment in Istanbul, said in e-mailed
comments.  Turkey’s  inflation  rate held at 10.4 percent last month,
close to a three-year high and the steepest among major  emerging
markets  worldwide after Argentina’s. Its current-account deficit
is about 10 percent of gross domestic product, the biggest among
60 major economies tracked by the International Monetary Fund as
a proportion of GDP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
