Twelve countries will sign a
declaration on solar and wind energy to boost cooperation
between nations and encourage investors, Danish Energy Minister
Martin Lidegaard said.  The agreement will be signed later this morning, he told a
news conference in  London . The declaration will include new
efforts to map wind and solar resources on a global level to
encourage private investment in the renewables sector, the
minister said.  With this kind of cooperation, “We can encourage the
industry and ensure that investors may come in in the right
places,” he said.  Germany , the U.K. and the U.S. are on board
with the plan, he said at the Clean Energy Ministerial
conference, where ministers are gathering to discuss progress
made by clean energy initiatives and enhancing collaboration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
