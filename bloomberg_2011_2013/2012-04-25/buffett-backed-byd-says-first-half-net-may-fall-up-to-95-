BYD Co. (1211)  fell the most in a month in
Hong Kong trading after the Chinese carmaker partly owned by
 Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  forecast first-half
profit may slump as much as 95 percent.  BYD sank as much as 6.1 percent to HK$19.82, the biggest
intraday dip since March 26, before trading at HK$19.90 as of
3:13 p.m. in Hong Kong. The company’s Shenzhen-traded shares
retreated as much as 3.8 percent to 26.36 yuan, the lowest level
since March 28.  Net income for the six months ended June 30 may drop to
between 13.8 million yuan ($2.2 million) and 68.8 million yuan
because of reduced earnings from solar energy and mobile
handsets, the Shenzhen-based manufacturer said in a statement to
the  Hong Kong  stock exchange yesterday. Demand for BYD’s cars
also slowed after the government ended buying incentives and the
popularity of its top-selling F3 sedan waned.  “The whole solar industry has a tremendous amount of
excess capacity,” said  Theodore O’Neill , an analyst at
Wunderlich Securities in  New York . “If you’re in an industry
that’s borderline profitless and you’re a smaller player like
BYD, it’s maybe going to be worse than profitless.”  First-quarter vehicle sales fell 8 percent from a year
earlier to 108,755 vehicles, the company said.  China ’s total
passenger-car sales slipped for the first time since 2005,
dropping 1.3 percent from a year earlier, as the slowing economy
and rising fuel costs curbed buying. BYD blamed the forecast
decline in profit mainly on a “great loss” in its solar cell
business.  Solar Cell Prices  Profit in the first three months of the year slumped 90
percent to 27 million yuan, down from 266.7 million yuan a year
ago. The company had earlier given guidance indicating a
decrease of 65 percent to 95 percent. Sales were little changed
at 11.7 billion yuan.  “The persistent decline in the global solar energy market
has led to a substantial decrease in the price of solar cell
products,” BYD said in the filing. For handsets, the market
share of the company’s major clients declined, it said.  BYD has risen 19 percent this year in Hong Kong trading,
compared with a 12 percent gain for the benchmark  Hang Seng
Index . The stock fell 2.2 percent to close at $2.62 in U.S.
over-the-counter trading, after the filing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
