VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP)  rose the most in a
month in U.S. trading after  Standard & Poor’s  raised the
company’s outlook to stable from negative today and Moody’s
Investors Service praised the sale of its Vietnamese unit.  VimpelCom, the world’s sixth-largest wireless operator by
subscribers, climbed 2.3 percent to $10.19 at 10:38 a.m. in New
York, the biggest one-day advance since March 28 based on
closing prices.  “The stable outlook reflects our view that VimpelCom will
retain its strong operating performance across its various
markets and use its free operating cash flow to reduce debt,”
S&P analysts, led by Alexander Griaznov in Moscow, said in an e-
mailed report dated today.  Moody’s said the sale of VimpelCom’s entire 49 percent
stake in its GTEL subsidiary in  Vietnam  for $45 million in cash
is “credit positive.” VimpelCom announced the sale in an April
23 statement.  “Moody’s regards this divestment as evidence of VimpelCom
pursuing its new strategy, which is focused on operating
efficiencies,” Moody’s analysts led by Artem Frolov in Moscow
said in an e-mailed report today. “One of the building blocks
of this strategy is a review of VimpelCom’s developing
businesses and their value for the group.”  VimpelCom’s subsidiary  Orascom Telecom Holding SAE (ORTE) , North
Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, is disputing the $1.3
billion fine imposed by an Algerian court against its Djezzy
unit for allegedly violating foreign-exchange regulations,
according to an April 12 statement. Algeria is in talks to buy a
stake in Djezzy from VimpelCom, which merged with Orascom last
year.  “VimpelCom’s credit profile has sufficient financial
flexibility to absorb the risks related to an unsettled dispute
concerning its Algerian subsidiary,” S&P analysts said in the
report today. “We assume that VimpelCom will remain committed
to its financial policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
