Ernesto Neto’s crocheted
installations at Tanya Bonakdar gallery in Chelsea are
irresistibly interactive.  Suspended from the ceiling, these mazelike pathways are
filled with thousands of colorful, hollow, plastic balls. Touch
them, smell them, let your feet sink into them.  On the second floor, two smaller pieces resemble a swing
and a cradle. I plopped into the latter and spent 10 minutes
rocking back and forth while observing the gallery through the
intricate weaving and knotting and color transitions in lilac,
ochre and green.  One of the sprawling installations is weighed down by rocks
and round clay pots holding spices and plants. The room smells
like cumin.  Prices range from $24,000 to $300,000. “Slow iis goood”
(sic), runs through May 25 at 521 W. 21 St. Information: +1-212-
414-4144;  http://www.tanyabonakdargallery.com   Marble Marden  One block north, Brice Marden has new abstract paintings at
the Matthew Marks Gallery’s two spaces on West 22nd Street.  The smaller houses nine canvases and a Song dynasty (960-
1127 A.D.) ceramic shard that inspired their palette of washed-
out blue and green.  The 4-inch chip of Ruyao-glazed bowl sits in a glass case
on a pedestal (earlier this month, a whole bowl from the period
fetched $26.7 million at Sotheby’s in  Hong Kong ).  Marden saw an exhibition of Ru ware in Taipei in 2007. The
nine-panel group captures the shades of the ancient glazes, once
described as “the color of the sky after rain,” according to
the press release.  The main gallery displays 15 new paintings Marden made with
oil and graphite on marble while staying on the Greek island of
Hydra last year. With their uneven shapes, cracks and rough
edges, the marble slabs convey a sense of history.  The compositions evoke Mondrian with yellow, red, green,
blue and brown geometric shapes sparsely placed on the marble’s
milky surface. The rock’s natural veins and swirls are often
complemented by graphite marks and clouds.  Prices start at $250,000. “Brice Marden: New Paintings”
runs through June 23 at 502 and 526 W. 22nd St. Information: +1-

inches above the floor at  Leo Koenig Inc.   “Josh” is a hyperrealist sculpture by artist Tony Matelli
who likes to meticulously recreate reality -- down to the hair
on the man’s legs -- then push it into the absurd.  The 2010 sculpture is made with silicon, foam, steel,
urethane and hair. How it remains suspended in the air is a
mind-boggling feat.  There’s also a grand bouquet of white and pink lilies in a
vase on a pedestal -- assembled from hundreds of cast bronze,
hand painted elements -- and flipped upside-down so that the
entire arrangement balances on a single bud.  The walls are lined with mirrors whose dusty surfaces
feature seemingly random scribbles and doodles done with a hand.
The randomness is deceiving, and the dust is not real; the works
have been laboriously layered with urethane and acid.  Prices for sculptures range from $10,000 to $120,000.
“Windows, Walls and Mirrors” runs through May 19 at 545 W.
