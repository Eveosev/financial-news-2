AvalonBay Communities Inc. (AVB) , the
second-largest publicly traded U.S. apartment owner, said funds
from operations climbed in the first quarter as the nation’s
multifamily vacancies fell to their lowest level since 2001.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, rose to $122 million, or $1.28 a share, from $93.5
million, or $1.08, a year earlier, the Alexandria, Virginia-
based real estate investment trust said in a statement today.
The  average  of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg was
for FFO of $1.24 a share.  The U.S. apartment vacancy rate fell to 4.9 percent in the
first quarter from 6.2 percent a year earlier,  Reis Inc. (REIS)  said in
an April 4 report. It was only the third time since the New
York-based property research firm began gathering the data 31
years ago that the rate was less than 5 percent. Renters are
competing for units as homeowners are displaced by foreclosures
and stricter mortgage standards block purchases.  “The rent versus own dilemma is becoming more visible, but
the level of move-outs to single family homes remains ‘tame’”
Ross Nussbaum, a REIT analyst with UBS AG, wrote in an April 13
report. He has a neutral rating on AvalonBay shares.  First-quarter results were released after the close of
regular U.S. trading. AvalonBay rose 0.8 percent to $145.64
today in  New York . The shares have gained 17 percent in the past
12 months, compared with a 12 percent advance in the Bloomberg
REIT Apartment Index of 16 companies.  AvalonBay is the largest U.S. apartment REIT after  Equity
Residential. (EQR)   To contact the reporter on this story:
