Eli Lilly & Co. (LLY)  Chief Executive
Officer  John Lechleiter  said rising sales of the antidepressant
Cymbalta and animal drugs stemmed losses from generic
competition, helping the company’s earnings beat estimates.  Net income  declined 4 percent to $1.01 billion, or 91 cents
a share, in the first quarter, the Indianapolis-based company
said today in a statement. Profit excluding one-time items beat
by 13 cents the average estimate of 18 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg. The company raised its 2012 earnings forecast.  Revenue dropped 4 percent to $5.6 billion, hurt by
declining sales for the antipsychotic Zyprexa after copies of
the drug were allowed on the market in the fourth quarter. Lilly
has slashed more than $1 billion in costs and fired 5,500
employees in anticipation of the drop in revenue. The company
doesn’t plan to initiate new cost cuts, and investors should be
prepared for several years of declining sales, Lechleiter said.  “This is a company that is facing a period of several
years where we will suffer the loss of several patents,”
Lechleiter said today in a telephone interview. “Buying Lilly
today means you’re investing in our pipeline and that is going
to be the means that we emerge and resume growth.”  Lilly has 12 drugs in late-stage testing including an
experimental treatment for Alzheimer’s, which Lilly will report
results on in the second half of the year, Lechleiter said.  Lilly gained 2 percent to $40.80 at 4 p.m. New York time.
The stock has risen 13 percent in the past 12 months.  Cymbalta, China  Sales of Cymbalta increased 23 percent to $1.1 billion.
Lilly also reported revenue growth of 41 percent in  China , the
company’s fastest-growing market. Zyprexa sales fell 56 percent
to $563 million.  Revenue also benefited from a 33 percent gain in sales from
its Elanco Animal Health unit, the company said.  Lechleiter said he has no plans to sell the company’s
animal business. Pfizer Inc. is considering a sale or spinoff of
its animal unit. Lechleiter declined to comment on whether Lilly
would be interested in buying Pfizer’s division.  Lilly raised its 2012 adjusted earnings  forecast  to $3.15
to $3.30 a share from $3.10 and 3.20 a share. Sales are set to
drop as much as 10 percent to $21.8 billion to $22.8 billion,
the company said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
