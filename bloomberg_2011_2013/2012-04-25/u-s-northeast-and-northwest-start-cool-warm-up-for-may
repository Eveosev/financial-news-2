The Northwest, Northeast and mid-
Atlantic states may start next week cooler and warm up as it
goes on, while much of the rest of the U.S. will have a steady
dose of above-average temperatures.  The U.S. from northern  California  to the Appalachian
Mountains, including Chicago, is expected to be 3 to 4 degrees
Fahrenheit (1.7 to 2.2 Celsius) above normal from April 30 to
May 4, said  MDA EarthSat Weather  in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  Commodities traders watch temperature outlooks and heating
degree days forecasts to gauge energy use and demand. About 51
percent of U.S. households use gas for heating, according to the
Energy Department, while demand from electricity generators
peaks in the summer months to meet air conditioning needs.  According to MDA’s forecast, an area from Northern
California to the confluence of the Mississippi and Ohio rivers
may have temperatures 5 to 7 degrees above normal.  Warmer weather is expected to persist from the  Rocky
Mountains  to the Southeast from May 5 to May 9, while the East
and West coasts are more seasonal, said  Matt Rogers , president
of Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland.  The normal average temperature for April 28 in  New York  is
about 57, according to MDA. It’s 53 in Boston, 54 in Chicago, 62
in  St. Louis , 66 in Atlanta, 72 in Dallas, 74 in Houston, 53 in
Seattle and 64 in Burbank, California.  To contact the reporter on this story:
