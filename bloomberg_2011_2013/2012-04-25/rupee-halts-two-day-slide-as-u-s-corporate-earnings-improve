India ’s rupee halted a two-day
slide after U.S. corporate earnings improved the outlook for the
global economy, spurring demand for emerging-market assets.  The rupee held this month’s loss at 3.5 percent after
earnings for companies in the  Standard & Poor’s  500 index rose
12 percent in the first quarter and results beat analysts’
estimates by 9.4 percent, according to the 145 listed in the
gauge that have released results since April 10. Apple Inc.
reported earnings yesterday that almost doubled last quarter.
Wipro Ltd., India’s third-largest software exporter, reported
today that fourth-quarter net income increased 7.2 percent,
matching analysts’ estimates.  “Risk appetite looks pretty supported,” said Goh Puay Yeong, a Singapore-based foreign-exchange strategist at Credit
Suisse Group AG. “Earnings from the U.S. came out quite
strongly. We’ll probably see the rupee slightly higher against
the dollar.”  The rupee traded at 52.7175 against the greenback as of
9:54 a.m. in Mumbai, compared with 52.6975 yesterday, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 52.87 yesterday, the
lowest level since Jan. 9. One-month implied volatility for the
rupee, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options,
fell 16 basis points, or 0.16 percentage point, to 10.48 percent.  Six-month offshore non-deliverable contracts were at 54.72
per dollar, compared with 54.74 yesterday. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-
deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
