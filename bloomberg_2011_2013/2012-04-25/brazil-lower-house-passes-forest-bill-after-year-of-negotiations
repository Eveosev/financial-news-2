Brazil ’s lower house passed a bill
that changes the way forests are managed following a year of
political wrangling.  The legislation was approved in a 274-184 vote and updates
the nation’s 1965 forestry code, according to a final count in
the Congress’ lower house. The bill may still have some changes
after lawmakers proposals of amendments before heading to
President  Dilma Rousseff .  Brazil’s lawmakers and lobby groups have clashed over
numerous elements of the legislation, which was first passed by
the lower house in May and then the Senate in December,
including an amnesty for some farmers who illegally cut forests.
The approved text includes some changes made by Deputy Paulo
Piau, who was charged with preparing it for the vote.  Between 2000 and 2010, more than 18 million hectares (44.5
million acres) of Amazonian rainforest were cleared, which is
about the size of  Syria , the National Institute for  Space
Research  said on its  website .  Piau represents the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party,
known as PMDB, in Minas Gerais state.  To contact the reporters on this story:
