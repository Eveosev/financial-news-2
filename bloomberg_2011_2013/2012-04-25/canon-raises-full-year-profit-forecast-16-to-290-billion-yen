Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest
camera maker, increased its full-year profit forecast by 16
percent to the highest in four years after the yen weakened.  Net income  in the year ending Dec. 31 may be 290 billion
yen ($3.6 billion), compared with the 250 billion-yen forecast
in January, the company said in a  statement  today. That was less
than the 296 billion-yen average of 22  analyst estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg. Tokyo-based Canon also raised its
operating profit and  sales  forecast for the year.  The maker of Ixus and PowerShot digital cameras is raising
its forecast after the Bank of Japan’s monetary stimulus led the
yen to decline 9.9 percent against the euro and 7.2 percent
against the dollar in the first quarter. The weaker yen is
helping the company, whose earnings were hurt by Thai floods and
 Japan ’s earthquake last year.  “The yen went up too quickly,” Edwin Merner, president of
Tokyo-based Atlantis Investment Research, which manages $300
million, said today by e-mail. “A weaker yen will help. But the
success will depend on coming out with new, better products.”  Canon rose  as much as 2.9 percent to 36 euros in German
trading. The shares advanced 1.5 percent to close at 3,800 yen
in Tokyo before the announcement. The stock has gained 11
percent this year, compared with a 37 percent increase for  Nikon
Corp. (7731)  and a 4.3 percent decline for  Sony Corp. (6758) , the maker of
Cyber-shot cameras.  Operating Profit  Canon, the maker of the  EOS range  of cameras, said
operating profit this year may be 450 billion yen, an increase
from the 390 billion yen predicted earlier. Canon raised its
sales estimate to 3.9 trillion yen from 3.75 trillion yen
predicted in January.  The net  income forecast  for the year will be the highest
since the company’s 309.15 billion-yen profit in 2008, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Canon based its profit forecasts on exchange-rate estimates
of 79.94 yen to the  U.S. dollar , compared with 75 yen
previously, and 104.91 yen per euro, revised from 100 yen. The
yen’s future gains against the dollar will be limited because of
the improving U.S. economic outlook, Chief Financial Officer
Toshizo Tanaka said.  Camera Sales  The company generates  80 percent  of its revenue outside
Japan. A depreciation of the currency boosts the repatriated
value of overseas sales.  “The yen is good news,” said Takashi Aoki, a senior  fund
manager  at Mizuho Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The outlook
is still conservative.”  The world’s second-largest printer maker loses about 9.2
billion yen of annual operating profit for every 1 yen decline
in the value of the dollar and 5.4 billion yen of income for
each 1 yen decline by the euro, the company said in January.  “The global economy is expected to take considerable time
before realizing a full recovery,” Canon said in the  statement .
“The  U.S. economy  faces such downward risks as high
unemployment and falling housing prices, whereas the European
economy is projected to remain stagnant for the time being.”  Income at the office-equipment division, Canon’s biggest
business, fell 16 percent from a year earlier to 52.8 billion
yen in the first quarter, while the company’s consumer unit,
which handles cameras, gained 17 percent to 46.7 billion yen.  Canon maintained its target of selling 22 million compact
cameras and 9.2 million single-lens reflex models this year.  Global shipments of digital cameras rose 5 percent to 14
million units during the first two months in 2012 from a year
earlier, according to the Camera & Imaging Products Association
in  Tokyo . Shipments in  Europe  and  Asia  each gained 18 percent,
while those in U.S. fell 10 percent, the industry group said
earlier this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
