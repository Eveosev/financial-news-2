Slovenia’s three largest banks,
including Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d., had their ratings lowered
one level by Moody’s Investors Service on their deteriorating
asset quality after record losses.  NLB and  Nova Kreditna Banka Maribor (KBMR)  d.d., in which the
government holds an indirect majority, had their deposit ratings
cut to Ba2 from Ba1, while  Abanka Vipa (ABKN)  d.d. score was lowered to
Ba3 from Ba2. All three lenders may be cut further, the ratings
service said in a statement today.  “The downgrades reflect the sharp asset-quality
deterioration in the banks’ loan portfolios and high
provisioning needs that have eroded their capital buffers and
loss-absorption capacity,” Moody’s said. More ratings cuts may
follow after the assessment of the banks’ capital raising plans
and the government’s ability to provide support if needed, it
said.  Slovenian banks were hit hard by a 2009 recession when
demand for exports in Europe dried up and the  construction
industry  collapsed. All three banks last year reported record
losses on increased bad provisions and may struggle further as
the economy enters another recession.  NLB reported a third consecutive loss in 2011 of 239
million euros ($316 million), while Nova Kreditna said last
year’s loss was 81 million euros.  Abanka announced today it’s seeking to raise 50 million
euros in a share sale. NLB said it wants to raise 400 million
euros by the end of June to improve its  capital ratios , while
Nova Kreditna is in talks with the  European Investment Bank  for
a 100 million-euro loan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
