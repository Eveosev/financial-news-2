OGX Petroleo & Gas Participacoes
SA, the  oil company  controlled by billionaire Eike Batista, rose
the most in four months after saying its Waikiki field was
declared commercially viable.  Shares gained 6.3 percent to 13.83 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the steepest advance since Dec. 20. The benchmark
Bovespa index slid 0.4 percent.  “The declaration of commerciality is a positive sign and
supports the company’s proposed production schedule for 2013,”
Banco Itau BBA SA’s analysts Paula Kovarsky and Diego Mendes
wrote in a note to clients today. “Declaring commerciality at
such an early stage of development came as a surprise.”  The company said the field off the coast of  Rio de Janeiro 
has 285 million barrels of estimated recoverable oil reserves.  OGX was founded by Batista in 2007 and it started to
produce oil in January after delaying the start of production
from August, the company said in a filing on Jan. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
