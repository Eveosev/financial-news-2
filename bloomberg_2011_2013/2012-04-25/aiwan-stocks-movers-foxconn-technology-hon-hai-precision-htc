to $11.6 billion, or $12.30 a share, as sales rose 59 percent to

predicted profit of $10.02 a share on revenue of $36.9 billion,

NT$105 billion ($3.6 billion), the company said in a statement.
Revenue was expected to be NT$106 billion, according to the
average of 22 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  “We are worried that HTC’s U.S. sales decline could not be
compensated by its growth in  Asia ,” said Laura Chen, an analyst
at BNP Paribas SA. “We think it is still too early to revisit
the stock and its dividend yield may not provide enough downside
support.”  Radiant Opto-Electronics Corp. (6176)  (6176 TT) jumped 5.8 percent
to NT$127, the biggest advance since March 14. The liquid-
crystal-display product maker said first-quarter net income was
