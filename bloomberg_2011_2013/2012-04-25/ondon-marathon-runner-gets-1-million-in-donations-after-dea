An Englishwoman who died in last
weekend’s  London  Marathon has raised a record $1.13 million in
donations for a U.K. charity.  Claire Squires had set up the fundraising website before
the race. She collapsed and died less than a mile from the
finish of the 26.2-mile race four days ago. The 30-year-old was
running to raise money for Samaritans, a U.K. counseling service
for people with depression.  The  website  has raised more than 710,000 pounds ($1.15
million), most of which came after the race. The funds, pledged
by more than 62,000 people, are a record by an individual
fundraiser for Samaritans, the charity said.  “Claire’s family have been incredibly moved by the measure
of support and donations from the public, and are amazed by the
amount raised so far, which continues to rise,” the
hairdresser’s relatives said in a statement released yesterday
by London Marathon officials. “These donations are a lasting
testament to their beloved daughter and the cause in which she
believed so passionately.”  Squires was running for Samaritans because her mother Cilla
has done volunteer work for the charity for 24 years. Further
investigations into the cause of her death are continuing,
according to the family’s statement.       To contact the reporter on this story:
