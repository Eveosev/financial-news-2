Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK) ,  Kenya ’s biggest
lender by customers, headed for the highest level in almost nine
months on first quarter earnings.  The stock advanced 4.9 percent to 21.25 shillings by 3:10
p.m. in Nairobi, the capital, the strongest finish since Aug. 8.
The volume of shares traded was more than double the stock’s
three-month average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We expect a bit of growth, but not to the same level as
last year because of the high  interest rates  which have slowed
down lending,” Kuria Kamau, a research analyst at Nairobi-based
Old Mutual Securities Ltd., said in a phone interview today.  Equity Bank will announce tomorrow earnings for the three
months through to March, it said in an emailed statement
yesterday.  In the 12 months to December, the lender’s net income
surged 44 percent to 10.3 billion shillings ($124 million) on
higher lending, especially to small- and medium-size companies.
Net interest income climbed to 19.3 billion shillings from 13.8
billion shillings, according to the bank.  To contact the reporter on this story:
