Green Wind Energy A/S is finalizing
the sale of one of its units to a Danish investor in renewables
to reduce debt, the  law firm  acting as trustee for the
Copenhagen-based wind company said.  The GW Energi A/S unit is expected to be sold within days,
John Schmidt, a partner at the Danish law firm Gorrissen
Federspiel and a Green Wind Energy trustee, said by phone. He
declined to name the buyer as the sale is not yet final.  Green Wind Energy, in liquidation, is disposing of assets
after accruing too much debt, Schmidt said. Poor wind conditions
in Germany, where the company has all its wind assets, in 2009
and 2010 failed to generate enough revenue to repay debts of
about a quarter-billion Danish kroner ($44 million), Schmidt
said. The company already sold a 28-megawatt wind park in east
 Germany  to a wind developer held by an Impax Asset Management
Ltd. fund.  The GW Energi unit operates four wind parks in Germany,
with the Prignitz facility the largest at 25.5 megawatts,
Schmidt said.  The unit is expected to undergo a “debt restructuring” in
the coming weeks as parent Green Wind is in liquidation, Schmidt
said. The parent went into liquidation on April 4, and Green
Wind’s listing on Nasdaq OMX Copenhagen was deleted April 11,
the exchange said in a statement at the time.  Schmidt was appointed trustee by the  bankruptcy court .
Green Wind still has a few small wind parks and “single”
windmills to be sold as part of the liquidation, he said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
