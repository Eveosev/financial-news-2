Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE)  climbed
the most in almost two years after it agreed to buy assets from
 Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL)  in  Brazil  and Chile, creating the
world’s biggest toll-road operator.  Abertis climbed as much as 6.5 percent, the steepest gain
since July 2010, and traded up 5.6 percent to 11.77 euros at
10:26 a.m. in Madrid.  The highway operator signed a preliminary agreement with
OHL to acquire concession assets in Brazil and Chile in exchange
for a 10 percent stake in Abertis, the Barcelona-based company
said yesterday. Abertis said it would also assume about 530
million euros in liabilities.  “For Abertis this means becoming the world’s biggest toll-
road operator,” Marta Olba, a Madrid-based analyst at Banesto
Bolsa, wrote in a report sent to investors today.  Actividades de Construccion & Servicios SA  rose as much as
9.7 percent to 14.86 euros, the biggest increase in three years.
OHL advanced 4.8 percent to 21.99 euros.  ACS said it’s negotiating selling its indirect stake in
Abertis. ACS holds 10.3 percent of Abertis, according to the
Spanish securities regulator. Abertis said it may consider
buying as much as a 5.3 percent stake from ACS.  “OHL benefits from the transaction thanks to Abertis’s
premium payment over Brazil and the ability to cut debt,” Juan
Moreno, a Madrid-based analyst at Ahorro Corp. Financiera, said
by phone. “The deal is also very positive for ACS.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
