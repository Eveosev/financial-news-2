Total Petroleum Ghana Ltd. (TOTAL) , a unit
of  France ’s  Total SA (FP) , said profit jumped 48 percent in the first
quarter as revenue climbed amid higher prices for gasoline.  Net income for the three months through March rose to 8.3
million cedis ($4.5 million) while revenue increased to 292.4
million cedis from 223 million cedis in the year-earlier period,
the company, which runs the largest network of fuel stations in
Ghana, said in a statement e-mailed by the Ghana Stock Exchange
today.  “The company’s revenue gained from the increase in
gasoline prices in February,” Derrick Mensah, a research
analyst at SIC Financial Services Ltd. in Accra, said by phone.
“Easy access to its filling stations by motorists also helped
to drive volumes.”  Ghana  raised gasoline prices by 12 percent in February,
Yaro Kasambata, a spokesman for Ghana’s National Petroleum
Authority, said by phone today. A 15 percent increase, announced
by the state-run authority in December, was later scaled back to
12 percent before it was implemented, he said.  “Growing competition on the market may affect the
company’s ability to grow revenue in the future,” Randy Mensah,
a stock trader at Accra-based Databank Financial Services Ltd.,
said in an e-mailed comment. “Other players on the market
marginally reduce prices to attract customers.”  Total gained 3 pesewas to 27 cedis by the close in Accra.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
