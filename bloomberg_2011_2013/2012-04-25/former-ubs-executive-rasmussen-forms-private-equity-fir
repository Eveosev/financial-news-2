Grant Rasmussen, the former
president and chief executive officer at  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s Canadian
wealth-management unit, has formed a private-equity firm called
GreatWave Capital.  Rasmussen, 46, also a former CEO of  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) ’s
RBC Direct Investing business, will be chairman of the new
company, he said in an interview today.  The Toronto-based firm will invest in Ontario companies
that are at least three years old and have gross revenue of more
than C$1 million ($1.02 million), GreatWave said on its  website .
Companies must also be willing to give up control of their
business.  GreatWave is looking for businesses “who have already got
past proof of concept, and they’ve got clients and sales, but
they haven’t figured out how to really leverage the model,”
Rasmussen said.  GreatWave made an investment in February in Barrie,
Ontario-based automated-teller machine provider  ViaCash . Terms
weren’t disclosed, Rasmussen said.  “We love the space,” Rasmussen said. “They’ve really
cornered a niche in mobile ATM’s for concerts, events,
festivals, those kinds of things.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
