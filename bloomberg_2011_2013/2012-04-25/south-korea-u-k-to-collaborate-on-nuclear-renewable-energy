South Korea  and the U.K. plan to
exchange technology and develop expertise in nuclear, wind and
other renewable energy, the South Korean government said.  South Koreaâ€™s Knowledge Economy Ministry will sign an
initial agreement with its U.K. counterpart for nuclear and
renewable energy technology in London on April 27, the  ministry 
said in an e-mailed statement.  The Korea Wind Energy Industry
Association  will sign a similar accord with the U.K. Renewable
Energy Association for  wind energy .  South Korea, which operates 21 nuclear reactors at home,
expects the collaboration will encourage local companies to
invest in the renewable energy industry in the U.K., the
ministry said.  For the U.K. to meet its binding European Union target of
deriving 15 percent of energy from  renewable energy  by 2020,
sales from the industry would need to be closer to 50 billion
pounds ($81 billion), the U.K. Renewable Energy Association said
on April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
