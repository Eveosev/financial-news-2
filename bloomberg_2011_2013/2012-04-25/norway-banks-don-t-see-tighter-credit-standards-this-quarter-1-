Norwegian banks don’t expect to
tighten credit standards further in the second quarter for
households or enterprises, a central bank survey showed.  At the same time, “banks do not expect any change in
credit demand in the second quarter,” the Oslo-based bank said
in a statement on its website today. Credit demand from
households and enterprises was “approximately unchanged,” last
quarter, the survey showed.  Banks tightened credit standards for households in the
three months through March, while keeping access to lending
“approximately unchanged” for enterprises, the central bank
said.  “The tightening of credit standards for households is
explained by the Financial Supervisory Authority’s new
guidelines and is reflected in stricter loan conditions,” the
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
