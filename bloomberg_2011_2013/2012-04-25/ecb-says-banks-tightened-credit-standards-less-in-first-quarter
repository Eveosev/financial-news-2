The  European Central Bank  said
banks tightened credit standards much less in the first quarter
than in the previous three months and expect more demand for
corporate loans in the second quarter.  “The net tightening of credit standards by euro area banks
declined substantially in the first quarter of 2012” and banks
anticipate “a further decline” of credit standards for loans
to non-financial corporations and housing loans in the second
quarter, the ECB said in its quarterly Bank Lending Survey
published today in Frankfurt. “For the second quarter of 2012,
banks expect much less negative net demand for loans to
households and a rise in demand for corporate loans.”  The ECB has flooded financial markets with more than 1
trillion euros ($1.3 trillion) of cheap three-year cash to ease
banks’ funding pressures and unlock credit. The ECB said today
that banks’ access to retail and wholesale funding improved
across all funding categories in the first quarter, “but
particularly for debt securities and money markets.”  “These developments attest to a substantial positive
impact” of the ECB’s two three-year longer-term refinancing
operations on banks’ funding conditions, the central bank said
in the report.  Banks also indicated that sovereign debt-market tensions
“had a substantially smaller impact on funding conditions
through balance sheet and liquidity management constraints and
other more indirect channels” in the first three months of the
year, the ECB said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
