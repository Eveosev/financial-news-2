Angang Steel Co. (347) , the biggest Hong
Kong-traded steelmaker, swung to a first-quarter loss as  iron
ore  costs gained and slowing economic growth in  China  dragged
down prices.  Net loss was 1.89 billion ($300 million) for the three
months ended March 31, compared with a profit of 71 million yuan
a year earlier, the Anshan, Liaoning province-based company said
today in a statement to the Shenzhen stock exchange, citing
Chinese accounting standards. The loss matched its initial
estimate announced on April 13.  Steelmakers in China, the world’s biggest producer, had
combined losses of more than 1 billion yuan in the first
quarter, the China Iron and Steel Association said. Weakening
exports and government curbs on property slowed steel demand.  The  shares  fell 1.7 percent to close at HK$5.32 today in
 Hong Kong , compared with a 0.2 percent drop in the benchmark
 Hang Seng Index . The stock has fallen 4.8 percent this year.  The  average Chinese price  for hot-rolled coil, a benchmark
product, fell for eight straight days to 4,346 yuan a ton today
from 4,395 yuan on April 13, according to researcher Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  Angang paid its parent Anshan Iron & Steel Group 7 percent
more for iron ore during the quarter, compared with a year
earlier, while average steel prices dropped 10 percent, UOB-Kay
Hian Ltd. analyst  Helen Lau  said on April 13.  Angang said on April 17 it will buy iron ore from Anshan
Iron at a 5 percent discount to the average spot price two
months ago. The previous rate was based on average prices of the
prior six months.  Iron ore prices  remain “distorted” and have room to fall
10 percent to 20 percent, Chen Ming,  Angang Steel ’s vice
chairman, said in Hong Kong on March 29.  Spot prices of 62 percent-iron ore arriving at China’s
Tianjin port have gained 6.1 percent this year, according to the
Steel Index. It fell 1 percent yesterday to $146.7 a ton.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
