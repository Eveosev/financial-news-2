Cypriot finance minister Vassos Shiarly said the euro-area countries agree on the need for
institutionalized financial stability and solidarity created by
financial support mechanisms.  “Our current position in the euro group on firewalls is
that we believe in this principle because we believe in the
institution of stability,” Shiarly told reporters in Nicosia
today. Firewalls are there to serve the purpose of creating
“stability in the euro-area countries and give some certainty
with respect to the institution of solidarity”.  Cyprus will take over the European Union’s presidency on
July 1 and shares the view that the euro-area members should
support each other, no matter which country’s financial
stability is threatened, the Cypriot finance minister said.  Shiarly, a former executive of the island’s largest lender,
Bank of Cyprus, said on April 23 that the euro-area’s third-
smallest economy may need to support one of its lenders with as
much as 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion).  Andreas Charalambous, director of economic research and
European Union affairs, said that there is consensus among euro-
area members to turn the temporary support mechanism into a
permanent one, expand the funds it can provide to support
countries or banks and expand its tools to make it more
effective.  -- Editors:  Chris Peterson , Zoe Schneeweiss  To contact the reporter on this story:
