ICE Futures U.S. today for the
first time used a “circuit breaker” to halt trading after a
rapid price drop, the exchange said.  The market feature, which was implemented to prevent short-
term aberrant price moves, was triggered when coffee futures
dropped 400 points, or 4 cents, within 15 seconds to $1.758 a
pound,  Lee Underwood , an ICE spokesman said in an e-mailed
statement. Trading was stopped for 30 seconds, ICE said.  “During the 30-second hold, trading continued at $1.758
and above in the July contract, and the market traded up
following the expiration of the hold,” Underwood said. July
futures fell 3.7 percent to settle at $1.7675 a pound today.  ICE said in a statement on March 20 that the use of the
“circuit breakers” would start on April 9 in markets for
sugar, coffee and other agricultural futures to curb price
swings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
