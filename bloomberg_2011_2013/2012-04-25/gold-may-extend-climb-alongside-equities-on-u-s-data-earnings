Gold may gain for a second day
after better-than-forecast company earnings and signs the  U.S.
economy  is improving drove global equities higher.  Spot gold was little changed at $1,641.95 an ounce at 9:39
a.m. in Singapore after climbing 0.2 percent yesterday as the
dollar dropped to a three-week low against a six-currency basket
including the euro. June-delivery bullion was little changed at
$1,642.40 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  New homes in the U.S. were  sold  at a 328,000 annual rate in
March, Commerce Department data showed yesterday, beating the
319,000 pace forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. Apple Inc.’s
profit almost doubled last quarter while AT&T Inc., the largest
U.S. telephone company, posted better-than-estimated earnings,
helping U.S. stocks advance. The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  climbed
for the first time in five days today.  “Gold prices rallied in line with a recovery in investor
risk appetite and a modest increase in the euro,”  James Steel ,
an analyst at HSBC Securities (USA) Inc., wrote in a note.
“Hints of stabilization in the U.S. housing market may have
helped boost equities thereby lending support to gold.”  The  dollar  held a drop versus the euro before Federal
Reserve policy makers conclude a two-day gathering. The  Federal
Open Market Committee  will release forecasts for interest rates,
growth, inflation and unemployment later today.  Spot silver, this year’s best-performing precious metal,
was little changed at $30.845 an ounce. Cash platinum climbed
0.2 percent to $1,547.75 an ounce, rebounding from its drop to a
three-month low yesterday. Palladium, this year’s worst-
performing precious metal, fell 0.2 percent to $667.50 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
