Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA) ’s deals with
Nimes airport in France will be investigated by European Union
regulators over whether the company benefited from French
government subsidies.  The European Commission will probe rebates and marketing
agreements between Ryanair and the airport that may have given
the airline an “undue economic advantage,” as well as
financial arrangements between French authorities and the Nimes
facility, regulators said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nimes airport received state subsidies of more than 2
million euros ($2.6 million) and cash advances of more than 9
million euros from 2000 until 2006, the EU said. The
investigation will also cover public subsidies to Veolia
Transport, a private company which has operated the airport
since 2007. The payments may violate EU state aid rules because
they “may cover ordinary operating expenses,” regulators said.  EU regulators opened a similar probe into Ryanair’s
agreements with  France ’s Carcassonne airport earlier this month,
adding to several reviews of discounts and subsidies offered by
small, regional airports across  Europe  to attract low-cost
airlines. The Brussels-based commission must approve large state
subsidies to airports and airlines and can order companies to
pay back government funding if it can’t be justified as
providing a public service.  “Ryanair’s arrangements with all EU airports comply with
competition rules,” said Stephen McNamara, a Dublin-based
spokesman for the airline, in an e-mail.  Nimes airport and Veolia Transport didn’t immediately
respond to an e-mail seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
