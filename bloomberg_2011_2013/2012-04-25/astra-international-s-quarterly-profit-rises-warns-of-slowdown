PT Astra International (ASII) ,  Indonesia ’s
largest automotive retailer, said first-quarter net income rose
8 percent from a year earlier, while adding its vehicle and
financing businesses will be impacted by tighter lending rules.  Net income in the three months ending March 31 rose to 4.65
trillion rupiah ($500 million) from 4.3 trillion rupiah a year
earlier, the Jakarta-based company said in an e-mailed statement
today. That’s 24 percent of the full-year mean estimate of 19.5
trillion rupiah, according to 22 analysts in a Bloomberg News
survey. Sales at Astra, which sells  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  vehicles
and  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  motorcycles, increased 20 percent from a
year earlier to 46.4 trillion rupiah, it said.  Sales growth at retailers such as Astra may slow as  Bank
Indonesia  requires buyers to pay a down payment of at least 30
percent for vehicle loans starting June 15 . About 65 percent of
Indonesian vehicles are purchased through financing, with an
average down payment of 10 percent to 15 percent, Sudirman M.R.,
chairman of the Indonesian automotive industries association,
said today. Sales this year may fall 20 percent short of the
association’s earlier target of 1 million units, Sudirman said.  “Astra Group has shown a strong performance throughout the
first quarter of 2012 in which almost all main businesses posted
growth,” President Director Prijono Sugiarto said in the
statement. “We’re optimistic in the long-term even though in
the short term, the automotive and financing divisions will be
impacted by the new regulation.”  Bank Indonesia kept on April 12 its  benchmark interest rate 
at a record low of 5.75 percent for a second month, helping spur
 consumer spending  in  Southeast Asia ’s biggest economy. The
nation’s domestic vehicle sales in the first quarter rose 11
percent from a year ago to 251,000 units, Astra said. The
company’s vehicle sales rose 16 percent to 146,000 units over
the same period, while motorcycle sales slid 3 percent to 1.9
million units, it said.  Astra’s heavy equipment unit,  PT United Tractors (UNTR) , said
today net income rose 18 percent from a year earlier to 1.5
trillion rupiah.  PT Astra Agro Lestari (AALI) , its palm oil unit, said
yesterday net income fell 42 percent to 377.9 billion rupiah.  Shares of Astra fell 0.7 percent to 70,900 rupiah at the
close in Jakarta, widening this year’s loss to 4.2 percent
compared with an 8.9 percent gain in the  benchmark stock index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
