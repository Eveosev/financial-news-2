ZTE Corp. (000063) , China’s second-biggest
maker of mobile-phone equipment, reported first-quarter profit
increased 19 percent on higher sales of handsets.  Net  income  rose to 151 million yuan ($24 million), from
127.3 million yuan a year earlier, the Shenzhen-based company
said in a statement today. Sales gained 24 percent to 18.6
billion yuan, from a restated 15 billion yuan.  ZTE Chairman Hou Weigui is diversifying the company’s sales
from its traditional focus on phone-network equipment into
consumer devices such as smartphones and tablets. ZTE became the
world’s fourth-largest mobile-device seller in the fourth
quarter, behind  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V) , Samsung Electronics Co. and  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  The company this week said smartphone sales will more than
double this year as it gains market share in Europe,  North
America , Brazil and Japan.  ZTE’s Hong Kong-listed shares rose 2 percent to close at
HK$19.60 before the earnings announcement. The  stock  has lost 20
percent so far this year, compared with a 12 percent gain for
the benchmark Hang Seng Index.  Huawei Technologies Co., China’s largest maker of equipment
for mobile phone networks, said this week that 2011 profit fell
to 11.6 billion yuan from 24.7 billion yuan a year earlier as
the company increased investment in research and development and
funded the global expansion of new businesses targeting sales of
consumer devices including smartphones and computer services for
