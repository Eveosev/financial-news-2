Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC)  maker of the
U.S. military’s Global Hawk drone, raised its 2012 profit
forecast after first quarter income rose 2 percent aided by
higher sales and margins at its electronics unit.  Profit for 2012 will be $6.70 to $6.95 a share, compared
with the forecast in January of $6.40 to $6.70 a share, the
company said today. Northrop rose 2.7 percent to $64.44 at 9:42
a.m. in  New York  trading.  In the first quarter, net income from continuing operations
was $506 million, or $1.96 a share, compared with $496 million,
or $1.67 a year earlier, the company said today in a statement.
The average estimate of 19 analysts compiled by Bloomberg was
$1.59 a share. Sales declined 8 percent to $6.2 billion.  Northrop faces challenges from proposed cuts in the
Pentagon’s fiscal 2013 budget that would affect the company’s
top-selling programs, including the Global Hawk drone and the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, on which it is a subcontractor to
planemaker  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   Wes Bush, Northrop’s chairman and chief executive officer,
has said he is focused on increasing profit margins and
returning cash to shareholders. He has raised dividends for
eight consecutive years. In 2011, Northrop paid out about $2.8
billion as dividends and share repurchases.  Northrop of  Falls Church , Virginia, rose $1.15 or 1.9
percent to $62.73 yesterday in New York trading and gained 7.3
percent percent this year before today.  Global Hawk Cuts  The Pentagon proposed in its 2013 budget saving $800
million by reducing purchases of Northrop’s Global Hawk Block 30
model. The Defense Department would also gain $1.6 billion from
the F-35 program by eliminating 13 planes.  While Northrop’s business in cybersecurity, unmanned
systems, intelligence, sensors and reconnaissance systems and
logistics are well-aligned with Pentagon’s priorities, “we do
not expect much growth in these areas over the next several
years, given the budget situation,”  Douglas Harned , an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein LLC in New York, wrote in an April 23
note to clients. He rates the stock market-perform.  The Pentagon plans to cut about $490 billion from its
planned spending over the next 10 years under budget-reduction
legislation, with an additional $500 billion if automatic cuts
take effect starting in January.  Improving Margins  Performance improvements at the company’s Electronic and
Information Systems units contributed to an increase in
operating income and profit during the quarter even as sales
fell, Northrop said in the statement.  Sales at Electronic Systems, the maker of radar equipment,
fell 4.6 percent to $1.72 billion, while profit rose 28 percent
to $304 million, the company said.  Information Systems sales fell 9 percent to $1.84 billion
whereas profit increased 5.6 percent to $205 million, the
company said.  Sales and profit at the Aerospace unit, maker of Global
Hawks, fell, according to the company. Revenue declined 8
percent to $2.38 billion and profit fell 2.7 percent to $279
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
