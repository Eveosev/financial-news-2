Greece ’s energy industry needs
emergency lending because the country is at risk of supply
disruption, according to a report by the energy regulator.  Greece should provide at least 350 million euros ($463
million) of emergency loans to the energy distribution companies
by the end of the month, PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP’s Greek unit
said in a report for the Independent Regulatory Authority,
according to a summary  posted  on the regulator’s website. The
funds would come from the Finance Ministry controlled  Deposits
and Loan Fund , according to the report.  “All of the players in the electricity market supply chain
face significant funding problems,” PwC said in the report’s
summary. “Additional delays in  cash flow , however marginal, at
any stage of the chain will have a significant impact on the
country’s supply.”  Some of the emergency loans to the industry, which can be
repaid in 2013 through the sale of carbon emission permits,
should be channeled towards DEPA SA, the state-controlled
natural gas supplier, according to the report.  “It is a fact that the energy market faces liquidity
problems, just like other sectors, which are a result of the
more general problems the  Greek economy  now faces,” Energy
Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said in an e-mailed statement.
The Energy Ministry “is working closely with the  Finance
Ministry , and is in constant contact with all the responsible
energy bodies,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
