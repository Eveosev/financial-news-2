Chicago gasoline rose against
futures after an upset at the Wood River refinery in Illinois.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline in Chicago rose 3 cents
against futures to a discount of 12 cents a gallon on the New
York Mercantile Exchange at 1:02 p.m. The prompt-delivery price
fell 4.41 cents to $2.9652.  The refinery, which is owned by  ConocoPhillips (COP)  and  Cenovus
Energy Inc. (CVE) , flared sulfur dioxide yesterday because of a wet
gas compressor upset, according to a filing with state
regulators. The 306,000-barrel-a-day plant is the third-largest
in the Midwest, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
