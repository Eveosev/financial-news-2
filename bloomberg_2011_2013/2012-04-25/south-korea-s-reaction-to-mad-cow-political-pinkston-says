Daniel Pinkston, an analyst at the
 International Crisis Group , comments on the South Korean
government’s reaction to a case of mad cow disease confirmed in
U.S. He spoke on the phone in  Seoul  today.  South Korea will take steps “soon” after the U.S.
confirmed its first case of mad cow disease in six years,
according to e-mailed statement from agriculture ministry.  Park Sang Ho, a ministry official, said earlier today the
government will halt customs clearance of U.S. beef imports.  “It’s a political economy story. It’s not a public health
story. It’s 98, 99 percent political economy story, and 1 or 2
percent public health and food-chain security story.  “Farmers and livestock ranchers in South Korea have
political clout, political influence.  “Politically, it’s more acceptable to grant protection to
them than to just give them income transfers, even though it’s
more expensive to  South Korea  as a whole.  “Because of the political sensitivity and political
influence of these rural voters, the government will look for
any and every opportunity to grant them protection, and here’s
another example of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
