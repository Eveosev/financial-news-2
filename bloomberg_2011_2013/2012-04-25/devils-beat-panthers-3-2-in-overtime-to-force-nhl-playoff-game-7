Travis Zajac scored in overtime to
give the  New Jersey  Devils a 3-2 victory against the Florida
Panthers and force a deciding Game 7 in round one of the
National Hockey League playoffs.  Steve Bernier scored his second goal of the series to give
the Devils a 1-0 lead in the first period last night at
Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey.  Ilya Kovalchuk had a power-play goal four minutes, 21
seconds into the second period as the Devils took a 2-0 lead.
Florida’s Kris Versteeg and  Sean Bergenheim  tied the game at 2-2
with goals in a six-minute span midway through the second period.  After a scoreless third period, Zajac’s goal came 5:39 into
overtime -- setting up a decisive seventh game tomorrow night at
 Florida .  In tonight’s only NHL game, the Washington Capitals play
the Bruins in Boston in Game 7 of their series. The New York
Rangers host Ottawa in the seventh game of their series tomorrow
night at Madison Square Garden.  To contact the reporter on this story:
