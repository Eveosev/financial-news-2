C.H. Robinson Worldwide Inc. (CHRW) , an
arranger of freight shipments, fell the most since October after
reporting first-quarter sales that trailed analysts’ estimates.  The shares declined 7.1 percent to $61.18 at 12:02 p.m. in
New York, a drop that was  among the biggest  for companies in the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The stock slumped as much as 8.9
percent earlier for the steepest intraday decline since Oct. 26.  Revenue was $2.55 billion, while net income rose 9.8
percent to $106.5 million, or 65 cents a share, the  Eden
Prairie , Minnesota-based company said late yesterday. Analysts
projected sales would be $2.61 billion and per-share earnings of
65 cents, based on the  average of estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  “While the company’s long-term outlook remains favorable,
we do not currently see a compelling reason to be more
constructive on the stock,”  Jason Seidl , a Dahlman Rose & Co.
analyst in New York, said today in a note to investors. He
rates the shares as hold.  To contact the reporters on this story:
