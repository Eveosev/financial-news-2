Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)  was sued by a
shareholder claiming its executives and directors mismanaged the
company, leading to alleged bribery of officials in Mexico and
coverup of an internal probe.  Company officers and directors responsible for the
wrongdoing should reimburse Bentonville, Arkansas-based Wal-Mart
for damages related to the investigation and the alleged
bribery, lawyers for investor Henrietta Klein said in a Delaware
Chancery Court complaint filed today in Wilmington.  Officials “are required to use their utmost ability” to
manage Wal-Mart fairly, and have shown “a reckless disregard
for their duties” and “should have been aware” of “a risk of
serious injury to the company,” Klein said in the suit.  The U.S. government investigation into $24 million in
alleged Mexican bribes as the company expanded south of the U.S.
border could cost Wal-Mart hundreds of millions of dollars,
according to former federal prosecutors.  Wal-Mart de  Mexico ’s growth in the last 10 years gave
the company about 20 percent of its stores in Mexico, out of
more than 10,000 worldwide.  Greg Rossiter, a Wal-Mart spokesman, couldn’t immediately
comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Klein v. Walton, CA7455, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
