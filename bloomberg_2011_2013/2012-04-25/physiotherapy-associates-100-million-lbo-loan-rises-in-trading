Physiotherapy Associates Inc.’s $100
million  term loan  B to back the company’s buyout by Court Square
Capital Partners rose in its first day of trading, according to
Markit Group Ltd.  The debt for the provider of outpatient rehabilitation
services first changed hands today at 98.5 cents on the dollar,
according to Markit. That’s up from an issue price of 98 cents,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Jefferies Group Inc.
arranging the financing for the Exton, Pennsylvania-based
company, the data show.  The loan pays interest at 4.75 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.25 percent floor for
the benchmark, Bloomberg data show. Libor, the rate at which
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other, serves as
a reference for about $360 trillion of financial instruments
worldwide.  Lenders will receive one-year soft-call protection of 101
cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more than
face value to refinance the debt during the first year.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
