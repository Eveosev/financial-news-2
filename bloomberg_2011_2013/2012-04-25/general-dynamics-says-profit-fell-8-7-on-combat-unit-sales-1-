General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  said first-
quarter profit fell 8.7 percent, because of a decline in sales
and profit at its combat systems unit.  Net income declined $564 million, or $1.57 a share, from
$618 million, or $1.64 a share, a year earlier, the maker of
Abrams battle tanks and Gulfstream jets, said today in a
statement. General Dynamics fell 1.2 percent to $69.19 at 10:04
a.m. in  New York  trading.  After adjusting for a non-cash charge of 13 cents a share,
profit was $1.70 compared with the average estimate of $1.69 a
share by 20  analysts  surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales declined 2.8
percent to $7.58 billion.  Jay Johnson, the company’s chairman and chief executive
officer, sees international and domestic demand for Gulfstream
jets offsetting weak orders for some of the company’s defense
products this year.  The Gulfstream G650, a large-cabin, long-range business jet
that’s in development, already has a backlog of more than 200
orders and “it’s a very, very well-received airplane before it
ever even hits the market,” Johnson has said.  Defense Cuts  The company’s first quarter result “reflects continued
growth in our aerospace segment as well as the challenges
presented” by slow defense orders, Johnson said in the
statement today.  The threat of automatic defense budget cuts, known as
sequestration, is slowing orders for General Dynamics’ military
radios, satellites, and information-technology systems, Johnson
said Feb. 23.  General Dynamics, based in  Falls Church ,  Virginia , said the
European operations of its Combat Systems unit had a $67 million
non-cash charge during the first quarter. The company reaffirmed
today its forecast for 2012 profit of $7.10 to $7.20 a share
made in January, less than the $7.33 a share estimate of 22
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  General Dynamics rose 79 cents or 1.14 percent to $70.06
yesterday in New York trading. They have gained 5.5 percent
before today.  Sales at the company’s Aerospace unit, maker of Gulfstream
jets, rose 20 percent to $1.62 billion, and profit gained 18
percent to $271 million, the company said.  Gulfstream Demand  Demand for Gulfstream jets was “healthy” in the quarter
with “particularly strong interest from North American
customers,” General Dynamics said in the statement.  The Aerospace unit had a funded backlog of $16.7 billion at
the end of the first quarter, the company said.  In its defense business, the company’s “high exposure to
Army spend is a concern,”  Douglas Harned , an analyst at Sanford
C. Bernstein LLC in New York, wrote in an April 23 note to
clients. In addition to the Abrams tanks, the company makes
Stryker combat vehicles for the U.S. Army. Harned rates the
stock market-perform.  The Pentagon plans to cut about $490 billion from its
planned spending over the next 10 years under budget-reduction
legislation, with an additional $500 billion if the automatic
cuts take effect starting in January.  Revenue at the Combat Systems unit, maker of Abrams and
Stryker vehicles, fell 2.3 percent to $1.91 billion and unit
income declined 27 percent to $203 million, the company said.  Sales at the Marine Systems unit, maker of the Navy’s
destroyers and nuclear-powered submarines, fell 4.2 percent to
$1.61 billion and profit gained 11 percent to $185 million.  Information Systems and Technology sales fell 13.3 percent
to $2.44 billion and profit declined 21 percent to $218 million,
the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
