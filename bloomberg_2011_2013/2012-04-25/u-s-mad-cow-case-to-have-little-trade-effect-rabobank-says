The discovery in the U.S. of a case
of mad cow disease, or atypical bovine spongiform
encephalopathy, will have “hardly any effect” on trade with
the European Union, according to Albert Vernooij, red-meat
analyst at Rabobank International.  The first U.S. case of the illness in six years was found
in a dairy cow in central  California , the Department of
Agriculture said yesterday.  “I expect this to have hardly any effect,” Vernooij said
by phone today from Utrecht,  Netherlands . “No meat entered the
food chain.”  “We’re used to BSE here in  Europe . There are hardly any
beef imports from the U.S.”  “During testing in the EU, occasionally an animal is
found. Just like in the U.S., so it turns out testing there
works as well. There’s nothing very exciting about this.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
