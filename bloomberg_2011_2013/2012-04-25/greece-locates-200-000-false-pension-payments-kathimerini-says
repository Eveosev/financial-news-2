Greece ’s pension funds can save as
much as 800 million euros ($1.1 billion) a year from cutting
false pension payments,  Kathimerini  said, citing Labor Minister
George Koutroumanis.  The ministry found that at least 200,000 pensions were
being paid to people who weren’t entitled to them, the Athens-
based newspaper reported, citing Koutroumanis.  Some of the false claims are redirected pension payments of
deceased Greeks or people residing outside of Greece, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
