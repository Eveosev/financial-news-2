Tallinna Kaubamaja AS (TKM1T) , Estoniaâ€™s
biggest retailer, reported first-quarter profit doubling from a
year earlier, helped mainly by increased demand at its
supermarkets and car retail unit.  Net income rose to 3.2 million euros ($4.2 million), from
1.6 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn-based company said
in a regulatory statement today. Revenue rose 10 percent to 106
million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
