Nigerian  inflation  accelerated to
12.1 percent in March as food prices increased, adding to
expectations the central bank will keep  interest rates  at a
record.  The inflation rate in Africa’s top oil producer climbed
from 11.9 percent in February, the National Bureau of Statistics
said in an e-mailed statement today. The median estimate of
eight economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for inflation to slow
to 11.4 percent. Prices rose 1.6 percent in the month.  The central bank raised its  policy rate  by 6 percentage
points to a record 12 percent since 2010 to curb price
pressures. Inflation is still below the central bank’s estimated
peak of 14.5 percent in the first half of this year, giving the
Monetary Policy Committee room to keep the benchmark rate
unchanged next month.  “As long as we’re around these levels, it’s unlikely the
Central Bank of Nigeria will react,”  Samir Gadio , an emerging-
markets strategist at Standard Bank Group Ltd., said in a phone
interview from London.  The naira rose 0.1 percent to 157.17 per dollar as of 2:50
p.m. on the  interbank market  in Lagos, the commercial capital.
The currency of the West African nation has gained 3.3 percent
this year.  Food prices, which account for more than half of the
 consumer price index , rose 11.8 percent in March from 9.7
percent in the previous month, the statistics agency said.  Core
inflation , which excludes farm produce, accelerated to 15
percent from 11.9 percent in the same period.  President  Goodluck Jonathan  partially cut fuel subsidies in
January, pushing up the gasoline price by half to 97 naira
($0.62) a liter (0.26 gallon).  The central bank is targeting an inflation rate below 10
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
