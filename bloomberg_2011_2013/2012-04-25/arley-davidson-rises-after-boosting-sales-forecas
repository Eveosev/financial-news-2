Harley-Davidson Inc. (HOG) , the biggest
U.S. motorcycle maker, jumped the most in almost five months
after the company increased its full-year production forecast.  Harley, as part of its first-quarter earnings statement,
said it expects to ship 245,000 to 250,000 motorcycles this
year, up from a January forecast of as many as 245,000, based on
demand from its “outreach” customers, which include people
under the age of 34, as well as women, Hispanics and blacks.
Harley rose 4.9 percent to $52.83 at 11:29 a.m. New York
time, after reaching $53.03, the biggest intraday jump since
Nov. 30.  Bikes such as the $7,999 Super Low and the Forty-Eight,
starting at $10,499, are winning new riders. Such customers made
up more than one-third of U.S. sales in the quarter, the
Milwaukee-based company said today, as marketing efforts bore
fruit.  “There were barriers that were keeping our outreach groups
from going to the dealership and riding a bike,” Chief
Executive Officer Keith Wandell said in an interview. “We
understand what those barriers are and we’re breaking them
down.”  First-quarter net income was $172 million, or 74 cents a
share, compared with $119.3 million, or 51 cents, a year
earlier, Harley said today in the statement. The average
 estimate  of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a profit
of 71 cents a share. Harley shipped 64,263 motorcycles in the
quarter, a 19 percent increase from 2011.  Sales, excluding financial services revenue, increased 20
percent to $1.27 billion. The average  estimate  of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg was for $1.22 billion in sales.  Harley, which also makes Fat Boy and V-Rod motorcycles, has
cut expenses by renegotiating labor contracts at factories in
Pennsylvania and  Wisconsin . First-quarter gross margin widened
to 35.9 percent from 33.1 percent a year ago.  Harley doesn’t expect production shutdowns because of a
shortage of a resin used in fuel and brake parts, Wandell said
in the interview.  Dana Holding Corp. (DAN) , a maker of driveshafts for cars and
trucks, reported a profit of $70 million, or 33 cents a share,
from a loss of $30 million, or 26 cents a share, a year earlier.
Excluding some items, profit was 44 cents a share. The average
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg survey was for a
profit of 41 cents.  Sales for Maumee, Ohio-based Dana gained 9.8 percent to
$1.98 billion, topping the $1.93 billion average estimate of
nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey. The shares rose 9.9
percent, to $15.28, after climbing as much as 11 percent, the
biggest intraday gain since Jan. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
