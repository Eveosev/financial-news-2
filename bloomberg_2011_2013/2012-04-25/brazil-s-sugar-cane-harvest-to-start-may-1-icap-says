The sugar cane harvest in  Brazil ’s
center south, the main growing region of the world’s biggest
producer, is set to start on May 1, after it stops raining,
according to Sao Paulo-based broker ICAP do Brasil Ctvm.  Sugar cane-growing areas in Brazil will get rains this
week, preventing the start of the new crop’s harvest, according
to weather forecaster Somar Meteorologia. Heavy rains will fall
in the states of Parana and  Sao Paulo  from today to April 27,
Marco Antonio dos Santos, an agronomist at the company in Sao
Paulo, wrote in a report e-mailed on April 23.  “As of April 30 on, it seems that rains may give a truce,
remaining dry for the next 10 days,” the broker said in a
report e-mailed today. The “sugarcane harvest should start its
activities in the first day of May.”  Delays to the crop, which usually starts in April,
alongside rainfall may help to increase yields and “guarantee a
better recovery of output,” ICAP said in the report.  Sugar cane output in Brazil’s center south may climb to 509
million metric tons in the 2012-13 season, industry group Unica
estimates. Output totaled 493.3 million tons in 2011-12, the
first drop in a decade, as dry weather, frost and flowering
reduced yields, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
