Kenya ’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in five days, reversing an earlier decline,
helped by inflows of the U.S. currency from coffee sales.  The currency of  East Africa ’s largest economy appreciated
0.2 percent to 83.15 per dollar by 12:40 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, after earlier dropping as much as 0.2 percent.  “In the morning, the currency had weakened on demand from
oil importers for month-end payments and corporates for salary
payments,” John Muli, a currency trader with Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview. “That’s since
turned around with dollar inflows from coffee and
horticulture.”  Sales at Kenya’s weekly coffee auction rose 42 percent to
7,562 bags valued at $1.83 million, from 5,317 bags for $1.32
million last week, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today.  The Ugandan shilling gained for a second day, advancing
less than 0.1 percent to 2,507.50 per dollar, while Tanzania’s
shilling climbed 0.1 percent to 1,584.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
