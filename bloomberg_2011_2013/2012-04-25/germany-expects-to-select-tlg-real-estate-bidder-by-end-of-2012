The German government said it’s
confident of a successful sale of its TLG Immobilien GmbH
property company because of the number and range of interested
bidders.  The  Finance Ministry , which is organizing the sale with
 Barclays Capital Plc (IEAC) , said it expects to pick a buyer for TLG’s
two units by the end of the year. The ministry’s deadline for
expressions of interest was April 16. The company was valued at
1.76 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in 2010.  “The large number of filed statements of interest
encompasses all investor classes,” said the ministry in the
April 23 report prepared for the Budget Committee and seen by
Bloomberg News. “What’s positive is also the reputation” of
the potential bidders.  The sale of one of the federal government’s last major
property assets is drawing interest from both foreign and
private investors after commercial and residential rents grew
amid economic growth of 3.7 percent in 2010 and 3 percent last
year. The ministry canceled a planned sale of TLG in 2008 as
bids dried up in the international banking crisis.  TLG’s properties are based mainly in formerly communist
East Germany, including Berlin. The company evolved from
property inherited at the collapse of the former communist
regime and from new investments. It has reported a profit every
year since 2002.  To contact the reporters on this story:
