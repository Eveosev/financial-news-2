Kenya has left marathon world
record holder Patrick Makau out of its squad for the 2012
Olympics after he failed to finish last week’s  London 
 marathon, the Association of Athletics Federations said.  Makau last year retained his Berlin marathon title by
winning the 26-mile race in a world-record time of 2 hours, 3
minutes and 38 seconds. He shaved 21 seconds off the mark set by
Ethiopia’s Haile Gebrselassie in Berlin in 2008. Makau didn’t
finish last weekend’s London Marathon.  London winners Wilson Kipsang and Mary Keitany made the
team, as well as double world champion Abel Kirui, who finished
sixth in London. Chicago Marathon title holder Moses Mosop also
made the men’s team, while reigning women’s world champion Edna
Kiplagat and silver medalist Priscah Jeptoo were selected for
the women’s team, according to the IAAF website.  At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Samuel Wanjiru became the
first Kenyan to win the gold medal in the event, setting a new
Olympic record. He died a year ago after falling from a balcony
at his home in  Kenya ’s Rift Valley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
