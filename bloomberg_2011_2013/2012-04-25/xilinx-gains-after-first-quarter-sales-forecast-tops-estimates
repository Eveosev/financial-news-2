Xilinx Inc. (XLNX) , a maker of
programmable chips used in mobile-phone base stations, rose the
most in more than three years after forecasting sales this
quarter that may beat some analysts’ estimates.  Revenue will rise 1 percent to 5 percent from the $559
million reported in the fiscal fourth quarter, Xilinx said in a
statement yesterday. That indicates revenue of $564.6 million to
$586.9 million, and compares with the average analyst estimate
of $555 million, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Xilinx is selling more chips to makers of mobile-phone
equipment as their customers spend to upgrade networks, which
are being strained by a surge in data demand from smartphones
like Apple Inc.’s iPhone, Chief Executive Officer Moshe Gavrielov said. Increasing factory automation is also creating
demand for Xilinx’s products, he said.  “You can’t keep selling iPhones and not upgrading the
systems -- they’ll just be paperweights,” Gavrielov said in an
interview. “There is growth in the industrial space. Factories
are becoming more automated.”  Net income in the fourth quarter, which ended March 31,
fell to $134.1 million, or 49 cents a share, from $160.1
million, or 59 cents, a year earlier, the  San Jose , California-
based company said. Sales declined 4.9 percent to $559 million.
That compares with average analyst estimates for earnings of 40
cents and sales of $531.6 million.  The  stock  rose 6.8 percent to $36.65 at the close in  New
York , for the biggest gain since Dec. 3, 2008. The stock has
climbed 14 percent this year.  Xilinx and rival  Altera Corp. (ALTR) , also based in San Jose,
dominate the market for chips that can be reprogrammed after
they’ve been installed in electronic devices. The use of their
products, traditionally limited to expensive communications and
industrial machinery, is spreading to new areas, such as
automobiles and consumer electronics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
