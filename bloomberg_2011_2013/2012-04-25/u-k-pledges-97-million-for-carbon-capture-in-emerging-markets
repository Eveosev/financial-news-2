The U.K. allocated as much as 60
million pounds ($97 million) to encourage the development of
carbon capture and storage technology in  emerging markets .  The funds will boost projects and develop new partnerships,
U.K. Energy Minister  Greg Barker  said today in a statement. The
money was drawn from International Climate Finance funding
that’s already been announced, the e-mailed statement said.  The  International Energy Agency  estimates that 3,400 plants
using CCS technology are needed by 2050 to meet a goal of
cutting carbon emissions in half. Efforts to introduce CCS are
falling behind, along with nuclear power and biofuels, IEA
Deputy Executive Director Richard Jones told energy ministers
from 23 nations today in London.  The U.K. funds contribute to the $200 million that should
be allocated globally to speed up deployment of the technology,
according to the  Carbon Capture , Use and Storage Action Group,
the government said in the statement.  “We recognize that it is important to ensure CCS is
deployed in developing as well as developed countries,” Barker
said in the statement. The U.K. is promoting the technology
itself with a 1 billion-pound funding contest begun in April.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
