Ormat Technologies Ltd. (ORA) , the Reno,
Nevada-based unit of an Israeli power plant developer, rose the
most in two months in New York on speculation a new building
contract will boost earnings per share by the end of 2013.  Shares of Ormat climbed 2.7 percent to $18.78 in the U.S.
yesterday, the most since Feb. 24. The  Bloomberg Israel-US
Equity Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest Israeli companies listed in New York
rose for the first time in four days, adding 0.8 percent to
90.61.  Mellanox Technologies Ltd. (MLNX)  also snapped a three-day slide
after Barclays Plc raised its price estimate on the company’s
U.S. shares by 18 percent.  Ormat Technologies, 60 percent owned by Yavne, Israel-based
 Ormat Industries (ORMT)  Ltd., won a $61.2 million deal to build a
geothermal power plant in  North America , according to a
PRNewswire statement yesterday. The project, which is expected
to be completed by the end of 2013, will boost earnings per
share by 30 cents over 2012 and 2013, Avondale Partners LLC
said. Analysts expect EPS to rise to 47 cents this year from 40
cents in 2011, according to the median of seven estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  “Aside from the obvious financial benefit, we view this
win as a positive as it shows there is incremental business in
the U.S. and that Ormat is quite competitive on bids,” Daniel Mannes, a Berwyn, Pennsylvania-based analyst at Avondale wrote
in a report e-mailed yesterday.  Ormat Technologies, an engineer and producer of energy-
generated power plants, said at the start of the month that it
received a contract to build and operate a generator in Kenya.  Surging Valuation  The company is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings
on May 8 and will probably say sales grew 14 percent to $112
million, according to the median of five analysts’ estimates
collated by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 33 percent to $124
million for the three-month period ending Dec. 31.  Ormat’s stock has gained 4.2 percent this year, sending
valuations to 36 times estimated earnings, more than triple the
average multiple for companies on the  New York Stock Exchange
Composite Index (NYA) , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ormat Industries rose 0.7 percent to 18.52 shekels in  Tel
Aviv  on April 24. The Israeli benchmark  TA-25 Index (TA-25)  has gained
0.9 to 1,162.95 this week. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange was
closed yesterday and will also be closed today.  The country, whose population of 7.8 million is similar in
size to Switzerland’s, has about 60 companies traded on the
Nasdaq Stock Market, the most of any nation outside the U.S.
after  China . Israel is also home to more startup companies per
capita than the U.S.  ‘Tip of the Iceberg’  Mellanox, a maker of technology used to transfer and store
data quickly, added 1.7 percent to $56.44 in  New York , paring a
loss of 9.8 percent in the past two days. The company’s Tel Aviv
stock rose 1.1 percent to 226.50 shekels, or the equivalent of
$60.38.  Mellanox jumped 52 percent in New York on April 19 after
forecasting second-quarter sales that beat analysts’ estimates.  Shares of the Yokneam Elit, Israel-based company will
probably rise to $65 in the next 12 months, up from a previous
estimate of $55, Barclays said.  “A significant percentage of the move has been driven by
investors who believe that the second-quarter guidance is just
the tip of the iceberg,”  Joseph Wolf , a Tel Aviv-based
technology analyst at Barclays, wrote in the report.  Revenue for the three months ending June 30 will probably
be between $125 million and $130 million, Mellanox said on April
19, exceeding the $83.4 million median estimate of 10 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  EZchip Rebounds  EZchip Semiconductor Ltd. (EZCH)  rose after dropping the most in
two years on April 24, adding 0.6 percent to $39.52. The chip
developer’s Tel Aviv shares retreated 0.8 percent on April 24 to
164.30 shekels, or the equivalent of $43.80.  Shares of the Yokneam, Israel-based company sank 9.3
percent on April 24 on concern 2012 sales will suffer after
competitor  Broadcom Corp. (BRCM)  debuted a similar product.  Though the new processor may boost competition for EZchip,
the company is “well positioned to grow revenue and earnings by
three to four times in coming years,”  Daniel Meron , an analyst
with  RBC Capital Markets , wrote in an April 25 report. The stock
decline “may provide a buying opportunity,” he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
