Nigeria ,  Africa â€™s largest oil
producer, plans to keep benchmark Qua Iboe crude exports in June
unchanged from May at 12 cargoes, according to a loading plan
obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country will also ship three lots of Yoho blend in
June, also stable from May, a separate plan showed. All
consignments are for 950,000 barrels each.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
