General Electric Co. (GE)  shareholders
re-elected the company’s board and approved pay packages for
Chief Executive Officer  Jeffrey Immelt  and other top leaders as
protesters disrupted its annual meeting in Detroit.  Shareholders also ratified changes to GE’s long-term
incentive plan and performance goals for senior executives. They
rejected investor proposals to exit the nuclear energy industry,
appoint an independent chairman and allow cumulative voting on
directors and shareholder action by written consent.  An address to investors by Immelt, who is CEO and chairman,
was interrupted by demonstrators who said GE’s tax bill is too
low, chanting, “Pay your fair share,” the  Detroit Free Press 
 reported . Hundreds of people, including shareholders, shut down
city streets outside the meeting, the newspaper said.  GE’s tax rate was 28.5 percent last year and 7.3 percent in
2010, according to company filings. Fairfield, Connecticut-based
GE is “compliant with every law everywhere around the world
around how we do our taxes,” Chief Financial Officer Keith Sherin said at the meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
