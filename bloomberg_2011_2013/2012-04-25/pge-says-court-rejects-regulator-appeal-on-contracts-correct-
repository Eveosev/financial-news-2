     (Corrects April 24 story to show that the energy regulator
lost the appeal.)  The Warsaw Appeals court yesterday
rejected an appeal by  Poland ’s energy regulator to prevent  PGE
SA (PGE)  from recovering 164.5 million zloty ($51.7 million) in costs
incurred in 2008 due to the winding down of long-term power
supply contracts for the utility’s Elektrownia Turow unit, PGE
said in a regulatory statement.  Poland’s biggest power utility said the verdict may be
appealed by the head of the Energy Regulatory Office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
