Shareholders of the Budapest Stock
Exchange approved a proposal to switch the trading system to
 Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s Xetra platform and the introduction of a
market-making system.  “Through connecting to the Xetra network the Hungarian
market will be more accessible for international investors while
the new market-maker model will help create additional liquidity
and enhance the quality of the market,” the bourse said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The new market-making system will used only for  trading
shares , according to the statement. The aim of the system is to
ensure continuous liquidity for listed instruments that can be
the basis of a future turnover increase and enhance the price
transparency of the market, it said.  Budapest bourse’s majority owner is the CEE Stock Exchange
Group, which also controls the exchanges in Vienna, Ljubljana
and  Prague  and wants to expand Xetra to all four locations.
Local brokerages, including Concorde Ertekpapir Zrt., said last
year they were opposed to the change in trading systems and
former bourse Chairman Mihaly Patai resigned, citing increased
duties during a “tense situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
