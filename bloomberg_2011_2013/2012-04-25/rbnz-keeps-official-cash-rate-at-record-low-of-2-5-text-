New Zealand ’s central bank left
 interest rates  at a record low in a decision announced today in
Wellington.  The following is the text of the announcement from RBNZ
Governor Alan Bollard:  Inflation is restrained and is expected to stay near the
middle of the Bank’s target range.  The domestic economy is showing signs of recovery.  Housing
market activity continues to increase and a recovery in building
activity appears to be underway, as forecast.  That recovery
will strengthen as repairs and reconstruction in Canterbury pick
up later in the year.  However, the global outlook remains of concern.  Near-term
indicators have moderated and financial market sentiment is
still fragile.  The  New Zealand dollar  has stayed elevated despite recent
falls in commodity prices.  Should the  exchange rate  remain
strong without anything else changing, the Bank would need to
reassess the outlook for monetary policy settings.  For now, it is appropriate for the OCR to remain at 2.5
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
