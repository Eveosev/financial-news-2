Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields for a second day, on demand for sol-denominated assets as
mining investment drives the currency to a 15-year high.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 5.27 percent at 12:02 p.m. in  Lima ,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.11
centimo to 116.96 centimos per sol.  Rising foreign direct investment has helped fuel a 1.8
percent advance in the Peruvian sol this year, leading the
nation’s central bank to purchase $7.5 billion in the  spot
market  to stem the gains.  “The outlook for FDI is pretty strong,” said Bret Rosen,
a Latin America strategist at Standard Chartered Bank in  New
York . “It’s a driver and rationale for money to be flowing into
the country.”  Mining and energy projects will account for 60 percent of
the $35 billion in investment expected through 2013, the central
bank said March 23.  The sol was little changed at 2.65 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.6510 yesterday, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.
That’s the sol’s strongest level since 1997,  data  from Peru’s
financial regulator show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
