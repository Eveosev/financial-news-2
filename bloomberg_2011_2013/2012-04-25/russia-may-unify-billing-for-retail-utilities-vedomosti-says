A Russian government commission led
by Deputy Prime Minister  Igor Sechin  has decided to bar consumer
and management companies from collecting retail electricity
payments in favor of a group of banks,  Vedomosti  said, citing
three unidentified people present at the meeting.  A payment center will be created using several banks as a
foundation to handle annual fees of 2 trillion rubles ($68
billion), Vedomosti said, citing a presentation to the
commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
