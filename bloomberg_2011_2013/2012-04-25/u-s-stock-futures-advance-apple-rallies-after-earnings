U.S. stocks advanced, giving the
 Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX)  its biggest gain this year, as Apple Inc.’s
earnings almost doubled and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said he’s prepared to do more to stimulate growth.  Apple, the most valuable company, surged 8.9 percent for
the biggest gain since November 2008.  Boeing Co. (BA)  added 5.3
percent as earnings beat estimates after the company delivered
more commercial jets while pushing production to record levels.
 Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) , the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, slumped 4.6 percent as revenue missed projections.  The Nasdaq-100 Index jumped 2.7 percent to 2,709.62 at 4
p.m. New York time. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index added 1.4
percent to 1,390.69. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  rose 89.16
points, or 0.7 percent, to 13,090.72.  Apple (AAPL)  is not a member of
the 30-stock gauge. About  6.8 billion  shares changed hands on
U.S. exchanges, almost in line with the three-month average.  “It’s encouraging,” James Swanson, who oversees about
$250 billion as chief investment strategist at Boston-based MFS
Investment Management, said in a telephone interview. “The
earnings season shows that companies can have good profitability
in a low growth environment. As long as these earnings hold up,
I’d say that’s a bright sign for the market.”  The  S&P 500  has risen 11 percent in 2012 on better-than-
estimated economic and corporate data. U.S. companies are
beating earnings estimates at the  highest rate  in two years as
economic growth at home helps counter a drag from  Europe .
Profits have topped forecasts at 80 percent of  S&P 500 (SPX)  companies
reporting since April 10.  Earnings Growth  Earnings  rose  11 percent on average, exceeding the 0.6
percent increase analysts projected when reporting began,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. All 10  industry groups 
in the S&P 500 delivered better-than-forecast results, with
financial, telephone and technology companies leading with a
positive rate of more than 10 percent, the data showed.  Stocks also rallied as policy makers said they expect
growth to gradually accelerate, while refraining from new
actions to lower borrowing costs. Central bankers today upgraded
their forecasts for economic growth and unemployment while
repeating their view that borrowing costs are likely to remain
“exceptionally low” at least through late 2014.  “The Fed is providing an insurance policy to the
economy,” said Ann Miletti, senior portfolio manager for Wells
Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin. Her firm
manages $213 billion. “There’s a sense that things are
improving, yet there’s some instability. The Fed is saying that
it will be there to help keep things going. Earnings have been
strong. The market likes it.”  Technology Gains  All  10 groups  in the S&P 500 rallied today as gains were
led by technology, which comprises  20 percent  of the index. The
group jumped 3.2 percent, the biggest advance since November.
The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index of companies most-tied to the
economy increased 1.6 percent. The Russell 2000 Index of small
companies rallied 1.8 percent to 812.12.  Apple surged 8.9 percent to $610. Demand from Chinese
consumers helped Apple sell a higher-than-predicted 35.1 million
iPhones last quarter and made the world’s most populous country
responsible for 20 percent of sales. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said there will be “a lot more opportunity” in  China  as
he introduces the iPad and expands operations there.  Before today, the company’s shares had tumbled $75.95 since
a record close of $636.23 on April 9 amid reports that indicated
a possible shortage in key components for Apple’s mobile devices
and showed a quarter-over-quarter decline in iPhone sales at
wireless carriers.  Erasing Doubts  “This report should erase any doubt in investors’ minds
that this company can’t continue to deliver,” said  Jack Ablin ,
chief investment officer of Harris Private Bank in Chicago,
which oversees about $60 billion, including Apple shares.  Boeing gained 5.3 percent to $77.08. It shipped 137
jetliners last quarter, compared with 131 deliveries by rival
Airbus SAS. Boeing is boosting output by more than 60 percent in
the four years through 2014 to pare a record order backlog from
customers seeking more fuel-efficient jets.  Aflac Inc. (AFL)  jumped 7.8 percent to $45.26. The world’s
biggest seller of supplemental health insurance said first-
quarter profit doubled as investment results  improved .  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)  rose 1.1 percent to $74.93 after voting to
recommend a 2-for-1 stock split to keep the shares available to
smaller investors. Chairman  Muhtar Kent , who pushed for the
company’s 11th stock split, may be philosophically at odds with
his biggest investor,  Warren Buffett .  1984 Letter  Buffett, who controls a  Coca-Cola stake  of almost $15
billion, has resisted splitting Class A shares of his Berkshire
Hathaway Inc. Splits, he said in a 1984 letter, may encourage
short-term investment strategies that enrich brokers at the
expense of the business.  “I don’t know what he would say about this one,” said
 Howard Buffett , the investor’s son and a director at Atlanta-
based Coca-Cola. Howard Buffett, who spoke today on the
sidelines of the soft-drink maker’s annual meeting, said he
voted for the 2-for-1 split.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  rose 0.6 percent to $86.85, after
swinging between gains and losses today. The energy company
raised its quarterly dividend to 57 cents a share from 47 cents
a share, according to an e-mailed statement.  Caterpillar slumped 4.6 percent, the most in the Dow, to
$103.44. The company says sales in  developing nations  this year
will be lower than anticipated, a reversal after 2011 growth in
 Latin America  and the Asia-Pacific region outpaced  North
America , helping to drive record revenue and profit.  Sales in China  The company is the latest manufacturer to report sales in
China have been curbed. United Technologies Corp. yesterday
posted a drop in Chinese orders while  3M Co. (MMM)  forecast below-
trend growth in the country.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer Lloyd C. Blankfein said he’s more optimistic about
markets than some economists and investors.  “I tend to be a little more positive than what I’m hearing
from other people,” Blankfein, 57, told Bloomberg Television
today in an interview at the investment bank’s New York
headquarters. “One of the big risks that people have to
contemplate is that things go right.”  U.S. stocks look reasonably priced when the value of
companies is measured against the size of the country’s economy,
said David R. Kotok, Cumberland Advisors Inc.’s chairman and
chief investment officer. He made a comparison between the total
market capitalization of companies in the S&P 500 and nominal
gross domestic product, which isn’t adjusted for inflation.  Bull Market End  Yesterday’s ratio was 83 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The gauge peaked at 101 percent in May
2007, near the end of a five-year bull market, and 131 percent
in August 2000, when the Internet bubble of the 1990s had begun
to burst. The earlier readings are circled in the chart.  “We are still two years away from a new high” for the S&P
500, Kotok wrote in the report. The prediction stems from the
outlook for  corporate profits  and labor costs along with the
index’s ratio to GDP, he wrote.  The S&P 500 may climb in 2014 to 1,600, which would lift
the total market value of its companies to 90 percent of GDP,
according to Kotok. His estimate for the index exceeds the
record close of 1,565.15 on Oct. 9, 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
