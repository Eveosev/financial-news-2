Goldman Sachs International, the
European unit of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , said revenue fell 31
percent to $5.1 billion from $7.4 billion in the year-earlier
period after volatile markets hurt its trading business.  Net income rose to $2.4 billion from $775 million in the
year to 31 December, while administrative expenses were cut to
$2.1 billion from $6.1 billion, according to documents filed at
 Companies House  in London.  The drop in expenses reflected a credit of $1.8 billion as
the company marked share-based compensation to market prices.
Shares in parent company Goldman Sachs Group, the fifth-biggest
U.S. bank by assets,  fell  48 percent last year.  Institutional Client Services, the trading business, saw
lower net revenue in fixed income, currencies and commodities.
Investment banking revenue was also “slightly lower” following
a drop in equity underwriting, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
