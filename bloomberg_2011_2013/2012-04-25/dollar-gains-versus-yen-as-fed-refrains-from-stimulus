The dollar rose against the yen
after the  Federal Reserve  refrained from new actions to
stimulate the economy.  The greenback fluctuated versus  Europe ’s shared currency
after the  Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement it
expects economic growth to gradually accelerate. The Fed kept
intact its program to exchange $400 billion in shorter-term
holdings for longer-term debt, dubbed Operation Twist and
scheduled to expire in June. The dollar fell earlier as U.S.
durable-goods orders dropped by the most in three years.  “There was a little bit of a bias hoping for something
that sounded clearly dovish, and I don’t think we got anything
that was clearly dovish,” said  Jens Nordvig , a managing
director of currency research in New York at Nomura Holdings
Inc. “The moves we’re seeing in the FX market are that tail
possibility coming out.”  The dollar rose 0.3 percent to 81.58 yen at 2:09 p.m. in
 New York  after falling earlier as much as 0.3 percent. It gained
0.2 percent to $1.3176 per euro after losing 0.3 percent
earlier. The 17-nation currency appreciated 0.2 percent to
107.54 yen.  The South African rand and Canadian dollar were the biggest
winners against the greenback. The rand gained 0.3 percent to
7.7759, and  Canada ’s currency rose 0.3 percent to 98.44 cents to
the  U.S. dollar .  Policy makers upgraded their forecasts for growth and
unemployment this year. They now see the jobless rate at between
7.8 percent and 8 percent, compared with January estimates of
8.2 percent to 8.5 percent. The economy is forecast to grow 2.4
percent to 2.9 percent, versus 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent.  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is scheduled to hold a press
conference at 2:15 p.m..  ‘Pick Up Gradually’  “The committee expects economic growth to remain moderate
over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually,” the
policy-setting FOMC said in a statement at the conclusion of a
two-day meeting today in  Washington .  Policy makers led by Bernanke are holding off on additional
steps to boost the economy amid signs the more than two-year
expansion is gaining strength. Still, the jobless rate isn’t
declining fast enough to satisfy central bankers, who repeated
their view today that borrowing costs are likely to remain
“exceptionally low” at least through late 2014.  “It seems pretty neutral,”  Mary Nicola , a currency
strategist at BNP Paribas SA in New York, said of the Fed policy
statement. “They did comment that they expect economic growth
to remain moderate and then pick up gradually. There have been
some changes, but overall it seems a bit balanced.”  Quantitative Easing  The central bank bought $2.3 trillion of assets in two
rounds of stimulus known as quantitative easing between December
2008 and June 2011. The  Dollar Index (DXY) , which Intercontinental
Exchange Inc. uses to track the greenback against the currencies
of six major U.S. trading partners, lost 14 percent during that
period.  The Fed has also kept its benchmark  interest rate  at zero
to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The Dollar Index rose 0.4 percent on March 13 after policy
makers at their last meeting raised their assessment of the  U.S.
economy , saying labor conditions “have improved further.”  The currency gauge dropped as Bernanke said April 9 the
economy is still “far from having fully recovered” from the
financial crisis. He spoke at a conference in Stone Mountain,
 Georgia , three days after the Labor Department reported that
U.S. payrolls growth slowed in March to 120,000 jobs, the lowest
level in five months.  The  Dollar Index  rose 0.1 percent today to 79.291 after
falling to 79.038 earlier, the lowest level since April 3.  Stronger Economy  Other data have showed a stronger economy. Retail sales
rose 0.8 percent in March, more than forecast, and the Standard
& Poor’s/Case-Shiller index of property values fell 3.5 percent
in the year ended February, the least since February 2011.  The pound fell today from a seven-month high versus the
dollar after a government report showed the U.K. slipped back
into recession, backing the case for the  Bank of England  to
extend its asset-purchase program.  The British currency was little changed at $1.6143 after
rising to $1.6171, the highest level since Sept. 6. It traded at
81.79 pence per euro after appreciating 81.44 pence yesterday,
the strongest since August 2010.  The greenback dropped earlier versus most major peers as
Commerce Department data showed U.S.  durable goods  orders slid
4.2 percent in March, the biggest decrease since January 2009,
after a revised 1.9 percent gain the prior month. Economists
forecast a 1.7 percent decrease, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  A report due April 27 will show U.S. economic growth slowed
to a 2.5 percent annual rate last quarter, from 3 percent in the
previous three months, a separate Bloomberg survey showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
