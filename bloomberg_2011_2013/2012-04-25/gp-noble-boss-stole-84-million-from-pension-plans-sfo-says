Tony Morris, the co-founder of U.K.
finance firm Money Portal Plc, stole 52 million pounds ($84
million) from pension plans to fund his lifestyle, the  Serious
Fraud Office  said.  Morris, whose company owned pension fund operator GP Noble
Trustees Ltd., went on trial this week at a London criminal
court over the allegations. He is charged with stealing
30 million pounds from GP Noble and its pension funds between
July and August 2007, and 22 million pounds from GP Noble and
BDC Trustees Ltd. in April 2008.  The money was spent on luxuries including an 150,000-pound
 Aston Martin , David Farrer, a lawyer for the SFO said at the
trial today.  “It’s not easy to see how the purchase and shipping of an
Aston Martin could be viewed by anybody as a transaction in the
best interest of the pensioners whose funds were being used to
finance it,” Farrer said.  Morris has denied the allegations and his lawyer will
present his defense later in the trial.  Morris was also accused by the SFO of conspiring with
others to defraud plans for which GP Noble and BDC Trustees Ltd.
acted as trustees by liquidating investments that had been made
on behalf of the funds and transferring the proceeds to bank
accounts outside of the U.K. for his own use.  An associate of Morris, Peter Malmstrom, who is also on
trial in the case, was charged with  money laundering  for
handling 6.95 million pounds of the funds allegedly stolen from
pension schemes administered by GP Noble in 2007 and 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
