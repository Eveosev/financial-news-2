New York Yankees  pitcher Michael Pineda will have surgery next week on a torn labrum in his right
shoulder and will miss the entire 2012 season, General Manager
 Brian Cashman  said.  Pineda, acquired in a trade with the Seattle Mariners
during the offseason for catcher  Jesus Montero , started this
season on the disabled list because of discomfort in his
pitching shoulder. He was diagnosed with tendinitis last month.  Cashman said yesterday he was “devastated” by the news
and that Pineda could return to the mound by May 2013. The
general manager said a scan on Pineda’s shoulder before the
trade did not reveal any damage.  “We got a healthy player to the best of everybody’s
knowledge,” Cashman told reporters before last night’s game at
 Texas . “In no way do I or the New York Yankees believe the
Mariners knew about this injury.”  The 23-year-old Pineda was an All-Star as a rookie last
season, posting a 9-10 record with a 3.74 earned run average in
28 starts for the Mariners. The Yankees sent Montero, one of
their top prospects, and pitcher Hector Noesi to Seattle to
acquire Pineda and pitcher Jose Campos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
