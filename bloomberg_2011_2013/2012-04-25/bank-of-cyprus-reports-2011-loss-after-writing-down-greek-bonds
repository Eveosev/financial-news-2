Bank of Cyprus Pcl , the country’s
biggest lender, reported a revised loss of 1.37 billion euros
($1.81 billion) last year after a deeper writedown of its Greek
 government bonds .  The net loss compares with a year-earlier profit of 306
million euros, the Nicosia-based lender said in a statement late
yesterday. In preliminary earnings released on Feb. 21, the bank
reported a 1.01 billion-euro loss in 2011 based on a 60 percent
writedown of the debt.  The lender said today it reduced the book value of its
Greek government bonds to 74 percent of their nominal value,
which led to a writedown of 1.73 billion euros, including
hedging costs.  Including the impairment on Greek bonds, the bank reported
a pro-forma core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of financial strength,
of 3.6 percent for 2011. The level should reach 6.9 percent by
June 18 after the completion of a capital-increase plan, the
lender estimated.  Central Bank of Cyprus Governor Athanasios Orphanides said
on Feb. 29 that  Bank of Cyprus  needs 400 million euros to reach
the European Banking Authority’s core Tier 1 capital target of 9
percent. Orphanides said losses for the east Mediterranean
country’s banks from the Greek debt swap were “manageable.”  Bank of Cyprus’s deposits dropped 10 percent to 29.7
billion euros last year and non-performing loans stood at 10.2
percent, the lender said.  The shares advanced 4.2 percent to 45 euro cents at 11:38
a.m. in Athens trading today, on course to snap a four-day
decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
