Russia will increase daily crude
exports through the Novorossiysk port on the  Black Sea  in May by
3.6 percent from this monthâ€™s levels, a preliminary loading
program obtained by Bloomberg News showed.  The nation plans to export 3.47 million metric tons from
Novorossiysk, including 3.23 million tons of Urals and 240,000
tons of Siberian Light grade, the plan showed. That is
equivalent to 820,487 barrels a day, compared with 791,640
barrels for April.  Urals exports from the Baltic Sea port of Primorsk include
59 cargoes of 100,000 tons each and one shipment of 105,000
tons, the plan showed. Ust-Luga, also on the Baltic, plans to
export 1.6 million tons in May, according to the program.  Russia will also ship two 60,000-ton consignments of
Siberian Light from Tuapse on the Black Sea next month, the same
as in April, the plan showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
