Philippine bonds and the peso
gained after a report showed the government’s budget deficit was
below target in the first quarter.  The shortfall of 33.91 billion pesos ($795 million) was
less than the 82.81 billion pesos programmed for the period, the
Bureau of the Treasury said today. Revenue increased 11.7
percent, while spending climbed 13.1 percent.  “Yields are starting to settle down,” said Jan Briace Santos, a fixed-income trader who helps manage the equivalent of
$16 billion at BPI Asset Management Inc. in  Manila . “It’s good
the government is doing well with the revenue collection which
means they can afford to spend without having to borrow more
from the market. The deficit looks manageable.”  The yield on the 8 percent bonds due July 2031 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.05 percent as of 4
p.m. in Manila, according to Tradition Financial Services.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 42.665 per dollar, prices
from Tullett Prebon Plc showed. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, dropped
to 4.75 percent from 5.1 percent.  Growth in the $200 billion economy slowed to 3.7 percent
last year from 7.6 percent in 2010. The  World Bank  and the
 International Monetary Fund  forecast expansion will accelerate
to 4.2 percent in 2012, aided by  government spending .  To contact the reporter on this story:
