Templeton Emerging Markets Group’s
 Mark Mobius  said that his funds are buying more European stocks
amid the debt crisis.  “The stocks in the European countries have gone down
excessively as a result of the bad news emanating from this
crisis and we find good investment opportunities at bargain
price and we are increasing the purchases of these stocks,”
Mobius, who oversees more than $40 billion as executive chairman
of Templeton Emerging, said in Bucharest today.  Central and eastern European shares are cheaper than in
other developing nations, with the MSCI Emerging Markets Europe
Index trading at six times estimated earnings, compared with
10.5 times for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index and 12.4 times
for the MSCI World Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We don’t think the crisis will last forever and the
European economies will recover nicely, there will be much more
fiscal disciple in one year or two,” Mobius said, adding that
he was buying shares in consumer-oriented companies and was
focusing on eastern  Europe .  To contact the reporter on this story:
