OAO Surgutneftegas (SNGSP)  sold five
cargoes of East Siberian Pacific Ocean crude for loading in June

International Plc (GLEN) , said six traders who participate in the

higher than a cargo sold to  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  earlier this week.
The Japanese trader paid about $3 above Dubai, said four traders
