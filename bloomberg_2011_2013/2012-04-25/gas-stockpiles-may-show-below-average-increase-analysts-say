U.S. natural-gas stockpiles
increased by 1.8 percent last week as mild weather kept fuel
demand near seasonal norms, according to analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose by 45 billion cubic feet to 2.557 trillion
in the week ended April 20, based on the median of 21 estimates.
The five-year average change for the week is an increase of 47
billion, according to the Energy Department, which is scheduled
to release its weekly supply report tomorrow.  “You had a demand decrease on the heating side because
temperatures got warmer, but the decrease was not as big,” said
Anthony Yuen, a natural-gas strategist at Citigroup Inc. in  New
York . “I think the excess gas will shrink and that will help
the gas prices rise.”  Warm weather early last week in the Northeast and mid-
Atlantic states increased gas use at  power plants  to run air
conditioners, Yuen said.  The high temperature in  New York City ’s  Central Park  on
April 16 was 88 degrees Fahrenheit (31 Celsius), 26 above
normal, the  National Weather Service  said. U.S. cooling demand
was 46 percent above normal that day while demand for heat was
49 percent below normal for the week ended April 21, according
to Weather Derivatives of Belton,  Missouri .  Possible Cooling  A brief cold snap could lift heating demand to 4 percent
above normal in the Northeast and north-central states for the
seven days ending May 2 while national cooling use may be 27
percent above normal, Weather Derivatives said.  Gas has dropped 32 percent this year on a  supply surplus 
that widened after the fourth-warmest winter on record in the
U.S. curbed demand while production rose to record levels.  U.S. gas use typically slumps after the winter, which is
the peak period for the heating fuel, and before heat spurs
demand from power plants to run air conditioners. Power plants
consumed about 31 percent of U.S. gas supplies in 2011,
according to the Energy Department.  The analyst stockpile estimates ranged from gains of 40
billion to 69 billion cubic feet.  U.S. stockpiles were 58 percent above the five-year average
for the week ended April 13, down from six-year high  surplus  of
61 percent at the end of March, department data show.  Natural gas futures last week dropped 5.4 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $1.927 per million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , after sliding on April 19 to $1.902,
the lowest intraday price since Jan. 28, 2002. Gas today rose
6.3 cents, or 3.2 percent, to $2.038 at 2:04 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
