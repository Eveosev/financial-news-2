Las Vegas Sands Corp. (LVS) , the casino
operator controlled by billionaire  Sheldon Adelson , posted
higher first-quarter profit, beating analysts’ projections as
gambling revenue increased in the U.S. and Asia.  Net income advanced 72 percent to $498.9 million, or 61
cents a share, the Las Vegas-based company said today in a
statement. Excluding some items, earnings of 70 cents topped the
60-cent average of  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Las Vegas Sands experienced a strong performance from its
domestic resorts and in Singapore, where casino revenue
increased 51 percent to $701.3 million in the quarter. The
Marina Bay Sands there averaged 98 percent occupancy at $341 a
night, the company said. In Las Vegas, casino revenue jumped 91
percent to $158.7 million.  “Excellent numbers,”  David Bain , an analyst at Sterne
Agee Leach Inc., said in an e-mail.  Las Vegas Sands said it posted a industry record of $1.07
billion in quarterly earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization.  “No company has ever achieved a $1 billion Ebitda for a
quarter,” Adelson said on a call with investors.  The company is expanding in Macau, the world’s largest
casino market and the only place in China where gambling is
allowed, through its Hong Kong-listed unit  Sands China Ltd. (1828) 
Casino operators in Macau are in a growth phase, driven by new
properties and non-gaming revenue, said Grant Govertsen, an
analyst with Union Gaming Research in Macau.  “We’re in a supply-driving-demand scenario,” Govertsen
said on Bloomberg Television’s “On the Move Asia” on April 20.  Revenue Gain  Sands China (1928)  net income rose 5.8 percent to $277.4 million.  Las Vegas Sands, which owns the Venetian and Palazzo
resorts in Las Vegas, said revenue rose 31 percent to $2.76
billion, beating estimates of $2.6 billion on average.  Adelson opened his latest property, the $5 billion Sands
Cotai Central, in Macau on April 11. He plans to build another
3,600-room casino hotel there and spend as much as $35 billion
on resorts in Spain.  Las Vegas Sands was little changed in extended trading. The
stock rose 4.2 percent to $58.78 at 4:15 p.m. in  New York  and
has risen 38 percent this year.  The company earned $289.3 million, or 28 cents a share, in
the first quarter of 2011.  ( Las Vegas  Sands began a conference call at 4:30 p.m. New
