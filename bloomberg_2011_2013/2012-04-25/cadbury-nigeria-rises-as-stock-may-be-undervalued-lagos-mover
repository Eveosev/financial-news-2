Cadbury Nigeria Plc (CADBURY) , a manufacturer
of drinks and food products, advanced for a fifth day in Lagos
on speculation the stock is undervalued, according to Lambeth
Trust and Investment Co.  The stock rose 5 percent to 13.07 naira by the close of
trading, the longest winning streak since July 29.  Cadbury reported a profit of more than 3 billion naira for
last year, which has “stimulated the appetite” of investors,
David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth Trust, said by
phone today. The stock is currently undervalued and if Cadbury’s
profit growth continues, the stock could rise to 30 naira in a
year, he added. “This is the second year it has reported profit
after tax, indicating that the company is on the trajectory to
full recovery,” he said.  Full-year net income for 2011 more than tripled to 3.7
billion naira, the Lagos-based company said on March 30. Cadbury
Nigeria returned to profit in 2010, with net income of 1.17
billion naira after a loss of 1.24 billion naira a year earlier.  While the share price fell after the release of the latest
results, “that was because the company did not pay any
dividend,” Adonri said. “However, when analysts went back and
looked at
the stock, they saw a long-term value in the security moving
forward, and that has propelled the new upsurge in the price.”  The stock has risen 15 percent this year, compared with a
6.3 percent gain in the Nigerian Stock Exchange  All-Share Index (NGSEINDX) 
over the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
