The naira strengthened for the
first time in three days after policy makers recommended oil
importers refund subsidy payments they consider to have been
illegal, prompting a pull-back in gasoline demand.  The Nigerian currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 157.15 per
dollar in interbank trading by 4:51 p.m. in Lagos, the most
since April 19.  Nigeria has regulated fuel prices since 2006, paying
importers the difference between the cost of imported fuel and
pump prices. A  House of Representatives  committee investigating
possible fraud in subsidy payments recommended on April 19
gasoline importers, including the state oil company Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp., refund 1 trillion naira ($6.4
billion). Payments totaling 2.5 trillion naira in fuel subsidies
were made in 2011 through a fraudulent process, the committee
said in a report.  “Dollar demand may have further declined today after
parliament insisted yesterday that  oil companies  must refund the
overpayment,” Sewa Wusu, currency analyst at Lagos-based
Sterling Capital Ltd., said by phone interview today. “The oil
importers need to get clear direction on subsidy payments to
resume imports fully.”  Nigeria sold $110.5 million at a foreign-currency auction
today, less than the $120 million on offer, with the naira
gaining 0.1 percent to 155.65 per dollar, the strongest since
the Nov. 21 sale, the Abuja-based  Central Bank of Nigeria  said
in an e-mailed statement.  The national  inflation  rate rose to 12.1 percent in March
from 11.9 percent a month earlier, the  National Bureau of
Statistics  said today. The central bank kept the benchmark
 interest rate  unchanged in March at a record of 12 percent.  The yield on the country’s $500 million of dollar bonds due
2021 fell one basis point at 5.453 percent in  London . On
domestic bonds due 2015, it fell two basis points to 15.18
percent, according to the April 24 data on the Financial Markets
Dealers Association  website .  Ghana ’s cedi was unchanged 1.8525 per dollar in Accra after
weakening for three trading sessions.
