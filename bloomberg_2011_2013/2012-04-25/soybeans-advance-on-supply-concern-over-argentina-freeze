Soybeans rose to a three-year high
in Chicago and rapeseed reached the highest in 15 months in
Paris on mounting concern that a freeze in  South America  and
rain in  Europe  will curb oilseed supplies.  Areas of Argentina saw “a light to hard freeze”
yesterday, leaving soybeans at risk of damage, Telvent DTN said
in a report. Oil World, a research company based in Hamburg, cut
its forecast for the country’s crop yesterday, saying production
may drop as much as 15 percent from a year earlier. In the
European Union, the world’s biggest rapeseed producer, cool,
rainy conditions have slowed crop development, Telvent DTN said.  “It looks like there’s going to be a bit of a shortage in
the supply of oilseeds in the next 12 months,” said  Dave
Norris , an independent grain broker in Harrogate,  England . “The
market is gearing up to have a very, very scary ride across the
summertime.”  Soybeans for July delivery rose 2 percent to $14.9375 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 1:14 p.m. in  London .
Prices reached $14.9675 earlier, the highest since July 2008.  Argentina’s government said last week that the soybean
harvest was 41 percent complete, compared with 52 percent a year
earlier. The country is the world’s third-biggest soybean
exporter after Brazil and the U.S.  Rapeseed for May delivery rose 1.2 percent to 513.50 euros
($678.49) a ton on NYSE Liffe in Paris, after touching 514
euros, the highest since January 2011. The EU’s Monitoring
Agricultural Resources unit cut its estimate for the 27-nation
bloc’s yields on April 23, citing cold weather in February.  Corn for delivery in July rose 1 percent to $6.14 a bushel.
Wheat for July delivery climbed 0.9 percent to $6.38 a bushel in
 Chicago . In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat rose 0.3
percent to 202.5 euros a ton.  Corn dropped and cattle futures plunged yesterday on
speculation demand for feed will weaken after a case of Bovine
Spongiform Encephalopathy, also known as mad-cow disease, was
found in  California . Cattle rebounded today after Japan and
Taiwan said they wouldn’t alter import controls on U.S. beef.  To contact the reporter on this story:
