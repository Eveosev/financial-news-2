GSO Capital Partners LP, the credit
investment arm of  Blackstone Group LP (BX) , expects to raise about
$3.25 billion for its second company rescue fund, according to
two people briefed on the plans.  GSO, based in  New York , is discussing the offering with
investors and marketing materials haven’t yet been sent, said
the people, who asked not to be named because the information is
private. The first fund, Blackstone/GSO Capital Solutions Fund,
closed in July 2010 with $3.25 billion as well.  Heather Lucania, a spokeswoman for Blackstone Group,
declined to comment.  The new fund will adopt a strategy similar to the debut
fund, which provides capital to companies in need of liquidity
or changes to their  capital structure  stemming from covenant
violations, debt maturities, or downturns in their business. The
first fund produced a 13.7 percent net internal rate of return
and a 1.1 times multiple as of Sept. 30, according to
 performance data  from  California Public Employees’ Retirement
System , which invested $250 million.  In March, GSO wrapped up its second mezzanine fund focused
on middle-market companies, GSO Capital Opportunities II LP, at
$4 billion, twice the amount it raised for its first mezzanine
fund.  GSO, which was purchased by Blackstone in 2008, managed
$47 billion in assets, primarily debt, as of Dec. 31. GSO was
founded in 2005 by  Bennett Goodman , Douglas Ostrover and
J. Albert Smith. All three previously worked at Credit Suisse
Group AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
