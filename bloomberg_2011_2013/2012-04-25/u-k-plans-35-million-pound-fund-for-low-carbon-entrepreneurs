U.K. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said
the government plans to offer 35 million pounds ($57 million) in
funds to support entrepreneurs who start businesses
supporting low-carbon technologies.  The money, to be announced today at a Clean Energy
Ministerial meeting involving 23 nations in  London , will feed
cash for projects such as low-energy LED lighting and heat
pumps, Davey said.  “It’s about accelerating progress on clean energy,” Davey
said in an interview on BBC Radio 4’s “Today” program.
He said the government also is licensing more natural-gas fired
power stations this year.  “We have seen less investment in gas than we expected a
few years ago,” Davey said. “Gas emits less than half the
carbon as coal.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
