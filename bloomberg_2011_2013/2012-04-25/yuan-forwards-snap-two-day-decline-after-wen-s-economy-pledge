Yuan forwards snapped a two-day
loss after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said  China’s economy  will avoid a
sharp slowdown and as data added to evidence a U.S. recovery is
gaining traction.  Wen said at a press conference in Stockholm yesterday that
the world’s second-biggest economy will sustain “steady and
robust” growth and will continue to commit to “reform and
opening up.” New homes in the U.S. were sold at a 328,000
annual rate in March, compared with the 319,000 pace forecast in
a Bloomberg News survey. The PBOC strengthened the  reference
rate  0.13 percent to 6.2923 per dollar, near to this year’s
average fixing of 6.3056.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.05 percent
to 6.3455 per dollar as of 10:19 a.m. in  Hong Kong , a 0.7
percent discount to the onshore spot rate, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility for the
currency, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, stayed at a six-week low of 2.1 percent.  “It’s been external sentiment that’s mainly affecting the
yuan recently,” said Chin Loo Thio, a senior analyst at BNP
Paribas in  Singapore . “Yuan volatility is going to remain low
as the  U.S. dollar  has been quite stagnant.”  The yuan rose 0.06 percent to 6.3037 in Shanghai, according
to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency is
allowed to trade 1 percent on either side of the daily fixing
and Thio predicts it will appreciate to 6.21 by the end of the
year. In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan rose 0.04 percent
to 6.3055.  China ’s economic performance still faces downward pressure
and the domestic and external situations are still “grim,” the
Ministry of Industry and Information Technology said in a
statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
