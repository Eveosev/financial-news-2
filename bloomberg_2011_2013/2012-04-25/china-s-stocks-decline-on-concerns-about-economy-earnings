China’s stocks fell after some
industrial companies reported slumping earnings and a major
government ministry signaled the nation’s economic slowdown may
worsen.  Tangshan Jidong Cement Co. dropped 1.9 percent in Shenzhen
trading after it reported a wider first-quarter loss. Steelmaker
Beijing Shougang Co. declined to a three-week low after it
forecast a loss in the first half from a profit a year ago.  The Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.2 percent to
2,383.22 at 9:50 a.m. local time. The CSI 300 Index declined 0.1
percent to 2,601.80.  China’s economic performance still faces downward pressure,
the Ministry of Industry and  Information Technology  said in a
statement ahead of a briefing in Beijing today. Chinese
companies are seeing increasing operational difficulties, it
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
