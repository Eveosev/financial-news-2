Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s biggest
lender, said it will take a 257 million euro ($340 million)
writedown tied to the sale of  Actavis Group hf  to  Watson
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)   The charge will take effect for the first quarter,
according to an e-mailed statement yesterday from the Frankfurt-
based lender. The bank added that it expects to boost its core
Tier 1 capital ratio by 6 basis points this year through a 290
million euro capital increase.  The sale will allow Deutsche Bank to recoup money it loaned
to Icelandic billionaire Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson to acquire
Actavis in 2007. It will also free up capital as Anshu Jain and
Juergen Fitschen prepare to become the bank’s co-chief executive
officers at the end of May. The deal would create one of the
world’s largest producers of generic drugs.  Deutsche Bank, which is scheduled to report financial
results before markets open today, may say that net income fell
to 1.57 billion euros in the first quarter from 2.06 billion
euros in the same period of 2011, according to the average
 estimate  of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Actavis overhauled its business after Bjorgolfsson lost
money during the financial crisis, leaving the lender with as
much as 5 billion euros of debt, people familiar with the
company said in 2009. The drugmaker  refinanced  in 2010. Deutsche
Bank posted an impairment of 407 million euros tied to Actavis
in the fourth quarter.  Deutsche Bank climbed 2.1 percent to 34.14 euros in
Frankfurt trading yesterday. The shares have advanced 16 percent
this year, compared with a 4 percent gain for the Bloomberg
Europe Banks and Financial Services Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
