Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez ’s
allies are preparing for a scenario in which his battle with
cancer will prevent him from competing in October’s vote, Tal
Cual  reported , citing Wilmar Castro, head of planning for
Chavez’s re-election campaign.  Chavez’s allies should also be prepared for a scenario in
which they will have to campaign with a weakened Chavez or where
the elections are canceled altogether, the Caracas-based daily
cited Castro as saying during a meeting of different factions of
the re-election campaign.  Campaigning with a Chavez weakened by his cancer would be
unworkable, Castro said according to Tal Cual. The possibility
that the election could be canceled has increased, which Castro
blamed on the opposition, Tal Cual reported without providing
further details.  The Information Ministry didn’t immediately reply to an e-
mail requesting comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
