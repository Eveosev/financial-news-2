The following is a roundup of
soccer stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable links to the
Web.  Kuyt Coming Home?  Dutch club Feyenoord has offered to turn Liverpool forward
Dirk Kuyt into the best-paid player in Rotterdam, the  Sun 
reported.  Kuyt had been the top scorer at Feyenoord in all three of
his seasons there before he joined Liverpool in 2006. He’s been
told he’s free to leave Anfield at the end of this season.  Feyenoord wants him for next season and should he decline
the move, the Dutch team won’t return with another offer because
the 31-year-old will be too old, the newspaper said.  Aquilani Return?  Alberto Aquilani  may return to Liverpool after AC Milan was
having “second thoughts” about keeping the player, the  Sun 
reported.  The 27-year-old midfielder has two years left on his
contract with Liverpool, which is worth 70,000 pounds ($112,700)
a week. The player, who joined Liverpool from AS Roma in 2009
for 20 million pounds, is on loan at AC Milan.  AVB to Valencia?  Former Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas may return to
football management at Spanish club Valencia, the  Daily Express 
reported. Villas-Boas was fired by Chelsea in March, after eight
months in charge at the west London club.  Besiktas in Race for Kalou  Turkish side Besiktas has joined Tottenham Hotspur in the
race to sign Chelsea striker  Salomon Kalou , the  Daily Mail 
reported.  Arsenal’s  Nicklas Bendtner , currently on loan at
Sunderland, is also on the radar of the Istanbul-based club, the
paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
