Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened on
speculation the central bank will tolerate faster gains to tame
inflation.  Government bonds  were steady.  Taiwan Power Co., the island’s only electricity retailer,
said on April 12 it will increase prices for the first time in
more than three years after posting losses on rising fuel costs.
Consumer prices rose 1.21 percent in March from a year earlier
after climbing 0.23 percent in February, official data show.  “Gains in the  Taiwan dollar  will help ease imported
inflation,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First
Securities Inc. in Taipei.  Taiwan’s dollar rose 0.04 percent to NT$29.514 against its
U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings traders
use to price options, dropped 20 basis points, or 0.2 percentage
point, to 3.2 percent.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1 percent bonds due January 2017 was
1.028 percent, compared with 1.031 percent yesterday, according
to Gretai Securities Market. That was the lowest level since
April 12.  “There isn’t much room for Taiwan yields to go down
because of the concern on consumer prices,” Hsing said.  The government sold NT$40 billion ($1.4 billion) of 20-year
securities yesterday at 1.725 percent, from 1.708 percent at a
March sale of debt of the same maturity.  The overnight  money-market  rate was little changed at 0.498
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center. It reached 0.5 percent yesterday, the
highest level since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
