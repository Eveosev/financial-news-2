Eletropaulo Metropolitana
Electricidade de Sao Paulo SA , the Brazilian utility unit of  AES
Corp. (AES) , is planning to install smart meters that will monitor
electricity usage for as many as 80,000 customers to improve the
reliability of its power grid and curb theft.  The three-year program may include other systems that will
help the Sao Paulo-based utility keep track of power consumption
as well as recharge points for electric vehicles, Paulo
Pimentel, manager of automation services, said in an e-mail
yesterday interview.  A growing number of South American utilities are using
smart meters, which may transmit data wirelessly and provide
utilities with information on blackouts and identify customers
who may be illegally tapping  power lines . Eletropaulo has
installed about 60,000 smart meters to date, making this its
biggest smart-grid project, Pimentel said.  “The main focus here is to improve the quality of our
service” and reduce power theft, he said in a telephone
interview. He said it’s too early to discuss costs.  The meters will comply with national standards that are
expected to be issued this year by the country’s electricity
regulator Agencia Nacional de Energia Eletrica, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
