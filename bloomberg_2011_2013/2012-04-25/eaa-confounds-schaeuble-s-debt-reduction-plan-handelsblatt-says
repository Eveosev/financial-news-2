Erste Abwicklungsanstalt, the so-
called bad bank formed to wind down assets of German state-owned
lender WestLB, will confound Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble ’s plan to reduce the country’s debt load,  Handelsblatt 
newspaper said, citing people it didn’t identify.  EAA expects WestLB to transfer a portfolio of about 100
billion euros ($132 billion) in the next months, of which about
50 billion euros will be added to the government’s debt, the
newspaper said.  The amount isn’t included in a debt-reduction plan that
Schaeuble sent to European authorities in Brussels and may boost
 Germany ’s debt load to 84 percent from 82 percent of gross
domestic product this year, Handelsblatt said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
