PPR SA (PP) , the French owner of the
Gucci luxury brand and Puma sporting-goods maker, reported
first-quarter sales that exceeded analysts’ estimates and said
it’s confident of achieving sales and earnings growth in 2012.  Revenue from continuing operations climbed 15 percent to
3.26 billion euros ($4.3 billion), the Paris-based company said
today in a statement. The average of six analysts’  estimates 
compiled by Bloomberg was 3.15 billion euros. Excluding
acquisitions and currency swings, the growth was 7.9 percent.  Sales were boosted by an 18 percent increase at the luxury
unit on a so-called comparable basis, though the pace of growth
slowed from 22 percent in the previous three months. PPR is
aiming for total revenue of 24 billion euros by 2020, with 10
billion euros coming from  Asia , as it focuses on  luxury goods 
and so-called sports and lifestyle brands.  The quarterly performance “reinforces our confidence in
PPR’s ability to deliver another year of brisk revenue growth,
combined with gains in operating and financial performance in
2012,” PPR Chief Executive Officer Francois-Henri Pinault said
in the statement.  The stock advanced 3.2 percent to 119.7 euros in Paris
trading today, giving the maker of  3,950-euro Balenciaga
sleeveless dresses  a market value of 15.1 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
