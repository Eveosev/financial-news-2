SSE Plc (SSE)  and  Repsol YPF SA (REP)  sought
approval for their planned Beatrice offshore wind project in
Scotland’s Outer Moray Firth.  Units of the two companies applied to build as many as 277
wind turbines at the site about 13.5 kilometers (8.4 miles) from
the Caithness coastline, according to  application documents 
posted on SSE’s website. The project may generate as much as 1
gigawatt, enough power for more than 796,000 homes, SSE said.  The application was presented as a battle between Scottish
First Minister  Alex Salmond  and New York real-estate
entrepreneur  Donald Trump  over offshore wind escalates. Salmond
is promoting turbines at sea to create jobs and boost the
economy. Trump, planning to open a golf course overlooking a
different, experimental offshore turbine project in July, argues
they’ll damage tourism and cost the economy in subsidies.  A decision on Beatrice from Scottish ministers is expected
in about nine months, according to SSE’s website. SSE Renewables
Holdings U.K. Ltd. owns 75 percent of Beatrice Offshore Windfarm
Ltd. with Repsol Nuevas Energias U.K. Ltd. holding the remaining
shares, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
