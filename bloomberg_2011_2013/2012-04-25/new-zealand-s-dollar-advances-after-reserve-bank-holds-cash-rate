The  New Zealand dollar  advanced
after the  Reserve Bank  left its official cash rate at a record-
low 2.5 percent.  The so-called kiwi climbed against all 16 of its major
peers after RBNZ Governor Alan Bollard said the economy was
“showing signs of recovery.” The Australian currency gained
for a second day versus the  U.S. dollar  after Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke’s comments that he’s prepared to “do
more” to boost the economy raised concern more monetary stimulus
will debase the greenback.  The New Zealand dollar rose to 81.71 U.S. cents as of 7:22
a.m. in Sydney, from 81.34 cents yesterday in New York. It
climbed 0.4 percent to 66.41 yen. Australia’s currency
strengthened to $1.0364 from $1.0353 and advanced to 84.27 yen
from 84.22 yen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
