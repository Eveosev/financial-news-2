Iran  denied reports that China is
buying less of its oil and said it extended contracts to export
crude to the Asian country,  Mehr  reported, citing an Iranian Oil
Ministry official.  “Iran’s exports to Chinese refineries have in no way
decreased in 2012,” Mohsen Qamsari, head of international
affairs at the National Iranian Oil Co., told the state-run Mehr
news agency. Iran is exporting an average of 500,000 barrels a
day to China, according to the report published yesterday.  Iran’s oil shipments to China fell for a fourth month in
March to the lowest in 22 months, according to Bloomberg
calculations based on Chinese customs data on April 23. Imports
fell 6.2 percent to 1.08 million metric tons, or about 254,000
barrels a day, the data show.  Purchases slid as  China  International United Petroleum &
Chemical Co., the nation’s biggest oil trader, put off signing a
2012 term contract with National Iranian Oil Co. after a
disagreement over payment terms. The issues were largely
resolved by the end of February, according to three people with
knowledge of the talks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
