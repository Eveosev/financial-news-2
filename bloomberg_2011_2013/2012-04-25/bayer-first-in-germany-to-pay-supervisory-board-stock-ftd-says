Bayer AG (BAYN)  is the first in  Germany  to
compensate its supervisory board with company stock,  Financial
Times Deutschland  reports today.  Members of Bayerâ€™s board must invest 25 percent of their
compensation in the drug and chemicals maker, a practice that is
common in the U.S. but not here, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
