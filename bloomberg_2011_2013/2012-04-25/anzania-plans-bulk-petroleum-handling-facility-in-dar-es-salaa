Tanzania plans to establish a bulk
petroleum-handling and storage facility at the Port of  Dar es
Salaam , according to the countryâ€™s port authority.  The Tanzania Ports Authority is seeking contractors to
build the facility, it said in a statement published in the Dar
es Salaam-based Daily News newspaper today. The project will
involve the construction of custody transfer tanks, a piping
system, manifolds and related facilities for bulk-fuel handling,
it said.  The Petroleum Importation Coordinator Ltd., a company
formed by oil marketers to manage the bulk procurement of
petroleum products, said it intends to pre-qualify more
companies to handle fuel purchases.  PIC Ltd., as the company is known, called for applications
from companies that want to be pre-qualified to be eligible to
bid for tenders to procure petroleum products under the bulk
procurement system, it said in a separate statement today in the
Daily News.  Companies will be pre-qualified mainly on their ability to
procure 150,000 metric tons of petroleum products per month,
according to the statement.  Tanzania began the bulk procurement system last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
