Upasna Bhardwaj, an economist at
 ING Vysya Bank Ltd. (VYSB) , comments after  Standard & Poor’s  lowered
 India ’s local-currency credit outlook to negative.  Bhardwaj spoke in a phone interview from Mumbai.  “The government has definitely been over-ambitious in
saying it would achieve a fiscal  deficit  target of 5.1 percent.  ‘‘The lack of a clear road map to achieve the target has
raised concerns about the feasibility of achieving the target
and that has possibly triggered the rating action. However, the
view can be reversed if the government gives a plan of action on
how the deficit target will be achieved.  ‘‘The pace of reforms needs to accelerate. At some point,
the government will have to deregulate diesel prices or increase
the frequency of price increase in order to stay with the
deficit gap.  ‘‘The reversal of this rating will depend on cumulative
action of how the  economy  fares, the trajectory of current
account deficit, how  inflation  is evolving and to what extent
the government is moving on fiscal discipline.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
