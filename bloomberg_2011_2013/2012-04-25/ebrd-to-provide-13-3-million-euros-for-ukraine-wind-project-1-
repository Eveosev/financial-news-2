The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development  will provide 13.3 million euros
($17.6 million) for a wind farm in western Ukraine to improve
power-supply reliability and reduce carbon-dioxide emissions.  The financing will consist of a 10-year loan of 9.5 million
euros from the EBRD and a 15-year loan of 3.8 million euros from
the Clean Technology Fund, the London-based bank said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Eco-Optima Ltd., a closely held Ukrainian company, will use
the funds to build and operate a wind farm with a capacity of
12.5 megawatts that will supply power to more than 10,000
households. The plant will be operational by the end of this
year and should reduce  carbon emissions  by about 26,000 tons a
year, according to the statement.  “Ukraine has a great potential in developing renewable
energy generation and this project is our contribution to this
good cause,” said Olivier Descamps, EBRD Managing Director for
 Turkey , Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia. “We are
committed to support the development of wind, solar, small hydro
and biomass energy projects in Ukraine through our own funds and
by providing technical assistance to them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
