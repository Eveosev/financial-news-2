Obrascon Huarte Lain Brasil SA (OHLB3) , the
Brazilian unit of  Obrascon Huarte Lain SA (OHL) , rallied to a record
after Spain’s  Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE)  agreed to buy a stake
in the company.  Shares  gained  2.1 percent to 81.90 reais at the close in
Sao Paulo, the highest since the company’s initial public
offering July 2005. The benchmark Bovespa index fell 0.4
percent.  Abertis agreed to acquire a 60 percent stake in OHL Brasil
and also OHL assets in Chile. The implied valuation of the deal
with OHL Brasil indicates a 14.3 percent premium over
yesterday’s closing price, according to analyst Renata Faber at
Banco Itau BBA in Sao Paulo. “We therefore expect a positive
market reaction,” she wrote in a report today.  OHL Brasil “will remain a public company in  Brazil  and
maintain its development strategy, to be implemented through new
growth projects,” the company said in the filing.  Spain’s OHL will receive a 10 percent stake in Abertis as
part of the deal, according to the filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
