Ethanol fell for the first time
this week in  Chicago  as corn and gasoline declined.  Futures slumped with corn on speculation that weather in
the Midwest will aid planting. Gasoline, or RBOB, decreased
after an Energy Department report showed  demand  fell 3.2 percent
to a five-week low of 8.5 million barrels a day. Corn is used to
make U.S. ethanol, which is blended into gasoline.  “RBOB was weaker and corn was getting beat up a little
bit,” said  Ian Jackson , a trader at SCB & Associates in
Chicago. “Ethanol drifted lower with it. It’s still in between
agriculture and the energies and that put pressure on it.”  Denatured ethanol for May delivery sank 1.3 cents, or 0.6
percent, to settle at $2.153 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices have dropped 2.3 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  added 2 cents
to $2.27 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel dropped 2
cents to $2.20, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents to $2.14 a gallon
and on the West Coast the additive slipped 0.5 cent to $2.31.  Corn futures for July delivery fell 1.2 percent to $6.01 a
bushel in Chicago, a second straight loss.  Gasoline for May delivery fell 0.36 cent to $3.1557 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  To contact the reporter on this story:
