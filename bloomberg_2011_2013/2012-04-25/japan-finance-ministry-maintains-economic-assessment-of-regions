Japan ’s Finance Ministry maintained
its overall economic assessment of the country’s regions, with
government reconstruction spending seen as supporting growth.  Regional economies “continue to improve at a moderate
pace, though there are differences between various areas” the
ministry said in its quarterly report released today in Tokyo.  The ministry raised its economic evaluation for three
regions: quake stricken Tohoku, the Tokai area where Toyota
Motor Corp. and auto parts makers are based, and Kyushu. The
assessment of the eight other regions including the Tokyo area
was unchanged.  The Ministry’s outlook was that  government spending  is
expected to continue fueling these regional economies.
“Downside risks” such as foreign exchange rates, oil prices,
overseas economic growth and the stability of the electricity
supply still remain, the report said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
