Russia , the world’s biggest  oil 
producer, will reduce its  export duty  on most crude shipments by
2.6 percent from May 1 after Urals prices dropped.  The standard duty will fall to $448.60 a metric ton, or
$61.20 a barrel, from $460.70 a ton in April, according to an
order signed by Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  and published
today on the government  website . The discounted rate on some
Eastern Siberian and Caspian Sea oil will drop to $232.40 a ton,
compared with $241.50 this month.  Russia bases the export duties on the average Urals crude
price from the 15th day of one month to the 14th of the next.
Urals, Russia’s benchmark export blend, averaged $120.76 a
barrel during the most recent period,  Alexander Sakovich , a
Finance Ministry adviser, said by phone on April 16. In the
previous monitoring period, the crude price averaged $123.53,
according to the ministry.  The government lowered the crude  tax rate  in October,
applying a coefficient of 60 percent, down from 65 percent, and
unifying the duty on most refined products at 66 percent of that
levy.  The duty for middle distillates and heavy products will
fall to $296 a ton next month, from $304 in April.  A gasoline tax that Putin imposed in May 2011 to counter
domestic shortages will fall to $403.70 a ton from $414.60 this
month. That is 90 percent of the crude duty. The government will
raise the duty on liquefied petroleum gases such as butane and
propane to $196.60 a ton from $158.60 this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
