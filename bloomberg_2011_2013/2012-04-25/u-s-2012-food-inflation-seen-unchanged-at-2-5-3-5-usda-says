U.S. consumers will pay 2.5 percent
to 3.5 percent more for food in 2012, the Department of
Agriculture said, holding to a forecast made in July.  Beef and seafood will post the biggest gains of any food
category, each climbing as much as 5 percent, the USDA said
today in a monthly  report  on its website. The department reduced
its estimate for price increases for fruits and vegetables to 2
percent to 3 percent, down a half-percentage point from March.  The Bureau of Labor Statistics this month said expenses
rose 0.1 percent in March. Food costs rose 3.7 percent last
year, according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
