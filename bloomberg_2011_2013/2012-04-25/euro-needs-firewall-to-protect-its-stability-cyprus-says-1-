Cypriot finance minister Vassos Shiarly said the euro-area countries agree on the need for a
financial firewall to ensure stability in the region.  “Our current position in the euro group on firewalls is
that we believe in this principle because we believe in the
institution of stability,” Shiarly said in Nicosia today.
Cyprus assumes the European Union’s presidency on July 1.  Shiarly, a former executive of the island’s largest lender,
Bank of Cyprus, said two days ago that the euro-area’s third-
smallest economy may need to support one of its lenders with as
much as 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion).  Andreas Charalambous, director of economic research and
European Union affairs, said there is consensus among euro-area
members to turn the temporary support mechanism into a permanent
one and increase the funds and tools it has available to support
countries or banks.  The Cypriot EU presidency’s agenda will include overseeing
initiatives aimed at strengthening the EU’s stability and growth
pact as well as addressing excessive deficits and economic
imbalances, according to the  ministry of finance  official.  Cyprus will also have to oversee preparation of the EU’s
2013 budget and the issue of a financial transaction tax,
Charalambous added. “There are countries strongly supporting
this initiative while there are other countries expressing
strong opposition,” he said.  -- Editor: Tim Farrand  To contact the reporter on this story:
