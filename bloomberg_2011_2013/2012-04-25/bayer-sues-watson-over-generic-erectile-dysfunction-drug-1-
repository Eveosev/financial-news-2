A  Bayer AG (BAYN)  unit sued generic drug
maker  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  for allegedly infringing two
U.S. patents for  Staxyn , a medicine approved in the U.S. in 2010
for treatment of male erectile dysfunction.  Bayer Pharma AG contends that Parsippany, New Jersey-based
Watson is planning to market a copy of Staxyn, a minty
preparation that dissolves in the mouth, before the patent
protections expire.  “Watson has acted with full knowledge” of the patents
“without a reasonable basis for believing that it would not be
liable for infringing,” Leverkusen, Germany-based Bayer said in
a complaint filed today in federal court in Wilmington,
Delaware.  Watson, which also makes a generic version of the Lipitor
cholesterol drug, said in a statement today that it would buy
Iceland’s Actavis Group hf for about $5.6 billion to create the
world’s third-largest maker of generic drugs.  Charlie Mayr, a Watson spokesman, didn’t immediately return
a phone call seeking comment on the lawsuit.  The case is Bayer v. Watson, U.S. District Court, District
of  Delaware  (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
