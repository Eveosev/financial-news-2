Encana Corp. (ECA) ,  Canada â€™s biggest
natural-gas producer by volume, reported a first-quarter profit
on gains from a price hedging program and asset sales.  Net income was $12 million, compared with a net loss of
$361 million a year earlier, the Calgary-based company said
today in a regulatory statement. Excluding one-time items,
Encana earned 33 cents a share, beating the 3-cent average
 estimate  of 19 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Commodity price hedging contributed $358 million in
realized after-tax gains, helping counter a slump in  gas prices .
Encana has also divested assets and brought in partners to boost
project funding, agreeing to sell a 40 percent stake in its 
Cutbank Ridge operation for C$1.45 billion ($1.47 billion) to 
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  in February.  Encana is expanding exploration and development of oil and
natural gas liquids, increasing first-quarter production 26
percent to about 29,000 barrels a day, according to the
statement. Natural-gas output was about 3.27 billion cubic feet
a day, 2 percent higher than a year earlier.  Gas prices in  North America , where production has soared
amid a boom in hydraulic fracturing, fell to their lowest
quarterly average in 10 years in the period. The fuel sold at an
average of $2.50 a million British thermal units, down from an
average of $4.20 a year earlier and a high of $13.577 in 2008.  Encana rose 0.1 percent to C$17.65 in Toronto yesterday.
The stock has six buy, four sell and 16 hold ratings from
analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
