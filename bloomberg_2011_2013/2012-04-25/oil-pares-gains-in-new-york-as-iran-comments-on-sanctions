Oil declined from a one-week high
in  New York  after Iran said it's considering a Russian plan to
halt the expansion of its nuclear program.  The Islamic Republic, facing a European Union ban on
imports of its crude from July, will study a Russian proposal
made last week, Ambassador Mahmoud-Reza Sajjadi said in an
interview at the Iranian embassy in Moscow today.  “A delay of the import ban is likely following the
beginning of talks with Iran,” said  Eugen Weinberg , head of
commodities research at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, who last
month correctly predicted prices had peaked in the short-term.
“We may see more easing of the supply situation following it.”  Crude for June delivery fell as much as 24 cents, or 0.2
percent to $103.31 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange ,
trading for $103.72 at 9:04 a.m. local time. Prices rose as much
as 94 cents earlier to $104.49 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
