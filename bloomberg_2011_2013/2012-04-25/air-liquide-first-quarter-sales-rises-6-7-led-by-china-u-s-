Air Liquide SA (AI) , the world’s biggest
producer of industrial gases, reported first-quarter sales that
met analysts’ estimates, led by growing demand in  North America 
and developing economies such as China.  Revenue climbed 6.7 percent to 3.78 billion euros ($5
billion), the Paris-based company said today in a statement. The
average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of analysts was 3.77
billion euros. Like-for-like sales of gas and services rose 4
percent in the quarter.  “This first quarter is characterized by a progressive
rebound in activity, particularly in the month of March,” Chief
Executive Officer Benoit Potier said in the statement. “Barring
a major economic downturn, Air Liquide continues to aim for
growth in net profit in 2012”  Potier predicted in 2010 that sales may rise 8 percent to
10 percent on average from 2011 through 2015 on demand for
oxygen, hydrogen and other gases used by the oil-and-gas
industry, steelmakers and in health care from  China , Russia, the
Middle East and other fast-growing regions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
