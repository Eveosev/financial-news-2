Anglo American Plc (AAL)  said a Chilean
court rejected a petition by Codelco to have 49 percent of the
dividends paid by Anglo’s local unit frozen in escrow amid a
dispute between the companies over copper assets.  Codelco’s April 17 application to the 14th Civil Court of
Santiago also sought to install a court appointee into Anglo’s
Chilean operations, the London-based mining company said in an
e-mailed statement today.  “The measures sought by Codelco had no justification
whatsoever and sought to improperly interfere with the operation
of Anglo American’s business interests in Chile,” Anglo said.  State-owned Codelco is seeking to exercise an option dating
back from 1978 to buy 49 percent of Sur. The unit includes the
Los Bronces mine, where Anglo completed a $2.8 billion expansion
last year, and two of the world’s best undeveloped copper
deposits, according to  John MacKenzie , head of copper at Anglo.  After Codelco sought the additional measures, Anglo
revealed to the court that it paid out dividends of $409 million
from the unit in March, Codelco said today in a statement on its
website. Of that amount, 49 percent should be subtracted from
the purchase price when the state-owned company wins the court
case, Codelco said.  Anglo, which sold 24.5 percent of Sur to  Japan ’s  Mitsubishi
Corp. (8058)  in November for $5.39 billion, said Codelco breached terms
by trying to take up the option prematurely.  Anglo gained 2.3 percent to 2,360 pence in  London .  To contact the reporters on this story:
