China ’s 22-day moving average for
the three benchmark crude grades that the government monitors to
set fuel prices fell 3.7 percent as of yesterday from the last
fuel-price adjustment on March 19.  Under a mechanism introduced by the government in 2008,
gasoline and diesel tariffs may be adjusted when the 22-day
moving average of Brent, Dubai and Cinta changes more than 4
percent from the last official price revision. While the
government hasn’t provided the weighting for the grades,
Bloomberg’s calculations assume all three are equally weighted.  Prices in the following table are in U.S. dollars a barrel
and are according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
