U.S. stocks maintained gains, while
Treasuries slid and the  Dollar Index  reversed a drop, as Federal
Reserve policy makers said economic growth will gradually
accelerate and refrained from new stimulus actions.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rallied 1 percent to
1,385.99 at 12:42 p.m. in  New York . The yield on the 10-year
Treasury note increased two basis points to 2.00 percent and the
Dollar Index, a gauge of the currency against six major peers,
was little changed after slipping 0.2 percent earlier. Oil fell,
helping drag the S&P GSCI Index of commodities lower.  U.S.  equities  maintained earlier gains triggered by higher-
than-forecast earnings at companies including Apple Inc. and
Boeing Co. Fed policy makers led by Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  are
holding off on additional steps to boost the economy amid signs
the expansion is gaining strength.  “The committee expects economic growth to remain moderate
over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually,” the
 Federal Open Market Committee  said in a statement at the
conclusion of a two-day meeting today in Washington. “Despite
some signs of improvement, the housing sector remains
depressed,” the panel said.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 10 percent in 2012 on better-than-
estimated economic and corporate data. Profits have topped
forecasts at about 80 percent of S&P 500 companies that reported
results since April 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
