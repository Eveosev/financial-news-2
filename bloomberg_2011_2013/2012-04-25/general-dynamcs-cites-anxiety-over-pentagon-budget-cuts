General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  and  Northrop
Grumman Corp. (NOC)  are working to cut costs and improve productivity
to compensate for declining defense sales, the companies said in
reporting first-quarter results.  Defense orders are slowing, particularly for information-
technology services, as the Pentagon seeks cuts of $490 billion
over a decade, with the potential of $500 billion more if
automatic reductions take effect in January, Jay Johnson,
chairman and chief executive officer of General Dynamics, said
today.  “Anxiety over these issues will almost certainly escalate
as we move into the summer months and election campaigns roll
into high gear,” Johnson said on a conference call with
analysts.  Net income at General Dynamics declined to $564 million, or
$1.57 a share, in the first quarter from $618 million, or $1.64
a share, a year earlier, the maker of Abrams battle tanks and
Gulfstream jets, said today in a statement.  After adjusting for a non-cash charge of 13 cents a share,
profit was $1.70 a share compared with the average estimate of
$1.69 a share by 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Sales
declined 2.8 percent to $7.58 billion.  In the first quarter, Northrop’s  net income  from continuing
operations was $506 million, or $1.96 a share, compared with
$496 million, or $1.67 a year earlier, the company said today in
a statement. The average estimate of 19 analysts compiled by
Bloomberg was $1.59 a share. Sales declined 8 percent to $6.2
billion.  Northrop’s Forecast  Northrop boosted its 2012 profit forecast today to $6.70 to
$6.95 a share, compared with its prediction in January of $6.40
to $6.70 a share. General Dynamics reaffirmed its profit
projection of $7.10 to $7.20 a share made in January.  Northrop rose 28 cents to $63.01 at the close of trading in
 New York . General Dynamics fell $2.50, or 3.6 percent, to
$67.56, the biggest decline since Nov. 23. Both are based in
 Falls Church , Virginia.  Defense sales growth will continue to be elusive for the
companies, according to Joel Levington, a bond analyst at
Brookfield Investment Management Inc. in New York  “Both companies experienced that this quarter and will
likely for years to come,” Levington said in an e-mail.  All four of Northrop’s business units reported better
margins in the quarter than a year earlier. Wes Bush, the
chairman and chief executive officer, attributed that to cost-
cutting and productivity gains.  Gulfstream Jets  A 20 percent increase in sales and an 18 percent rise in
profit at General Dynamics’ Gulfstream jet business was offset
by a one-time charge at its Combat Systems unit as operating
income declined.  Demand for Gulfstream jets was “healthy” in the quarter
with “particularly strong interest from North American
customers,” General Dynamics said in the statement.  The aerospace unit, which makes the  business jets , had a
funded backlog of $16.7 billion at the end of the first quarter,
the company said.  The threat of automatic federal budget cuts, known as
sequestration, is slowing orders for General Dynamics’ military
radios, satellites, and information-technology systems, Johnson
said.  Revenue at the Combat Systems unit, maker of Abrams tanks
and Stryker vehicles, fell 2.3 percent to $1.91 billion and unit
income declined 27 percent to $203 million, the company said.  General Dynamics said the European operations of its Combat
Systems unit had a $67 million non-cash charge during the first
quarter.  Sales at the Marine Systems unit, maker of the Navy’s
destroyers and nuclear-powered submarines, fell 4.2 percent to
$1.61 billion and profit gained 11 percent to $185 million.  Information Systems and Technology sales fell 13.3 percent
to $2.44 billion and profit declined 21 percent to $218 million,
the company said.  Northrop’s Drones  Northrop faces challenges from proposed cuts in the
Pentagon’s fiscal 2013 budget that would affect the company’s
top-selling programs, including the Global Hawk drone and the
F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, on which it is a subcontractor to
planemaker  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)   The Pentagon proposed in its 2013 budget saving $800
million by reducing purchases of the Global Hawk Block 30 model.
The Defense Department would also gain $1.6 billion from the
F-35 program by eliminating 13 planes.  Bush has said he is focused on increasing profit margins
and returning cash to shareholders. He has raised dividends for
eight consecutive years. In 2011, Northrop paid out about $2.8
billion as dividends and share repurchases.  Cybersecurity, Sensors  While Northrop’s business in cybersecurity, unmanned
systems, intelligence, sensors and reconnaissance systems and
logistics are well-aligned with Pentagon’s priorities, “we do
not expect much growth in these areas over the next several
years, given the budget situation,”  Douglas Harned , an analyst
at Sanford C. Bernstein LLC in New York, wrote in an April 23
note to clients. He rates the stock market-perform.  Performance improvements at the company’s Electronic and
Information Systems units contributed to an increase in
operating income and profit during the quarter even as sales
fell, Northrop said in the statement.  Sales at Electronic Systems, the maker of radar equipment,
fell 4.6 percent to $1.72 billion, while profit rose 28 percent
to $304 million, the company said.  Information Systems sales fell 9 percent to $1.84 billion
whereas profit increased 5.6 percent to $205 million, the
company said.  Sales and profit at the Aerospace unit, maker of Global
Hawks, fell, according to the company. Revenue declined 8
percent to $2.38 billion and profit fell 2.7 percent to $279
million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
