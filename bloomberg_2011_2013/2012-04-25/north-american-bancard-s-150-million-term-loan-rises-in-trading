North American Bancard LLC’s $150
million  term loan  to refinance debt and to fund a dividend
payment rose in its first day of trading, according to Markit
Group Ltd.  The debt for the provider of credit-card processing
services began trading yesterday at par, Markit prices show.
That’s up from the issue price of 98.5 cents on the dollar,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Credit Suisse Group AG arranged the financing for the Troy,
Michigan-based company, the data show.  The loan pays interest at 5.5 percentage points more than
the London interbank offered rate, with a 1.5 percent floor for
the benchmark, Bloomberg data show. Libor, the rate at which
banks say they can borrow in dollars from each other, serves as
a reference for about $360 trillion of financial instruments
worldwide.  Lenders will receive one-year soft-call protection of 101
cents, meaning the company would have to pay 1 cent more than
face value to refinance the debt during the first year.  In a revolving credit facility, money can be borrowed again
once it’s repaid; in a term loan it can’t.  To contact the reporter on this story:
