OAO Alrosa,  Russia ’s diamond
producer, may spend 5.6 billion rubles ($190 million) developing
natural gas assets this year to make them more attractive for
sale,  Vedomosti  said, citing company documents.  The company may also simplify its holding structure,
placing it directly under Alrosa’s ownership rather than
offshore structures, Vedomosti reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
