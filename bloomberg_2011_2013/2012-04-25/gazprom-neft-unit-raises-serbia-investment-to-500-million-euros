Naftna Industrija Srbije AD (NIIS)  opened
an acid recycling unit at its main oil refinery, bringing its
total investments to 500 million euros ($661 million) since
Russia’s  OAO Gazprom Neft (GAZP)  took over the Serbian company in 2009.  The 14.3 million-euro unit is part of a 550 million-euro
overhaul of the Pancevo refinery that will be completed by the
end of the third quarter, enabling annual production of 640,000
tons of gasoline and 1.5 million tons of diesel, the company
said in a statement today.  Gazprom Neft bought Naftna Industrija, known as NIS, from
the Serbian government for 400 million euros, pledging to invest
at least 500 million euros by the end of the third quarter of
2012.  “Gazprom Neft has met its investment obligations ahead of
schedule envisaged by the purchase agreement,” Chief Executive
Officer Kirill Kravchenko said today.  The vertically integrated NIS has also invested in oil and
gas fields in the northern Vojvodina province, its refinery in
Novi Sad as well as expanded its retail network of gas stations.
Its biggest investment is a 396 million-euro hydrocracking
facility at the Pancevo refinery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
