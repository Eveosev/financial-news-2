Barclays Plc (BARC)  was accused of
undermining the integrity of the London interbank offered rate
in a lawsuit filed by a care home company which claims it was
sold unfair interest rate swaps linked to the measure.  Companies in the Guardian Care Homes Ltd. group sued
Barclays for repayment of about 12 million pounds ($19.3
million) and for termination of the swaps.  “Barclays knew of its own conduct in relation to the
fixing of Libor rates and therefore knew, or ought to have
known, that the Libor representations were untrue,” Guardian’s
lawyers said in legal papers, citing the regulatory
investigations and press reports.  Libor, the benchmark borrowing rate between banks which is
used as the basis for $360 trillion of securities, is the
subject of regulatory probes worldwide examining whether
lenders manipulated rates for their own benefit.  The conduct of Barclays and that of other banks “was such
as to undermine the integrity of Libor rates,” the lawyers said
in the filings. Guardian claims that the Libor-fixing claims
invalidated the interest swaps it bought and said it’s seeking
documents from the bank to determine “the full nature and
extent of Barclays’ conduct.”  Barclays considers the  action  “is completely without
merit” and “will contest it vigorously,” Jon Laycock, a
spokesman for the bank, said in an e-mailed statement.  “Barclays is satisfied that it provides sufficient
information to enable a client to make an informed, commercial
decision about the products it offers,” Laycock said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
