China Development Bank  Corp., the
nation’s biggest policy lender, said profit rose 23 percent last
year as it expanded loans to support key infrastructure and
power projects.  Net income climbed to 45.6 billion yuan ($7.2 billion), the
state-owned lender said in a statement on its website. The non-
performing loan ratio dropped by 0.28 percentage point to 0.4
percent as of Dec. 31, according to the statement.  China Development Bank, which sold a 10 billion yuan stake
to the national pension fund last year, increased lending by 22
percent to aid  economic growth , according to the statement. New
loans to the power industry more than quadrupled from a year
earlier to 123.4 billion yuan as the lender helped ease an
electricity shortage, it said.  The bank’s capital adequacy ratio fell to 10.78 percent
from 10.87 percent, according to the statement. The bank cut
securities holdings by 28 percent last year to meet liquidity
and risk-management needs, the lender said, without elaborating.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
