China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the
nation’s biggest insurer, dropped in New York trading after it
said profit fell 29 percent in the first quarter as impairment
losses on equity investments surged.  Net income  dropped to 5.63 billion yuan ($893 million), or
0.20 yuan a share, from 7.97 billion yuan, or 0.28 yuan, a year
earlier, the Beijing-based company said in a statement to the
Shanghai stock exchange yesterday.  The insurer’s American depositary receipts dropped 1
percent to $39.74 at 12:36 p.m. in New York, after earlier
declining as much as 1.7 percent. Each ADR represents 15
underlying common shares. The stock fell 1.2 percent to close at
HK$20.50 in  Hong Kong , before the earnings.  China Life recorded 7.69 billion yuan in impairment losses,
up almost fivefold from a year earlier, as the value of its
stock holdings fell. The benchmark  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
slumped 25 percent in April-December last year as the government
tightened lending to curb inflation and imposed restrictions on
the  property market . The index rallied 4 percent in the first
quarter of 2012.  The insurer also reported a 433 million-yuan fair-value
loss on investments, compared with a 332 million-yuan gain a
year earlier, according to the statement.  Net premiums earned fell 7.6 percent to 112.7 billion yuan
in the first quarter, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
