A group of Chinese residents of  New
York  who sued the People’s Republic of China last year claiming
the government censored their writings asked a federal court in
New York for a $17.4 million default judgment because the
country didn’t answer the complaint.  The writers sued China and  Baidu.com Inc., (BIDU)  the owner of
China’s most popular Internet search engine, in May 2011,
seeking $16 million in damages. They claimed that their pro-
democracy writings about China were censored or banned from the
search engine.  “The execution of the request would infringe the
sovereignty or security of the People’s Republic of China,” the
Ministry of Justice said in a letter dated Jan. 29, referring to
a request to serve legal papers on the government or  Baidu.com .  Stephen N. Preziosi , the lawyer representing the writers,
said he filed the request to enter the default judgment today
after learning that the ministry wouldn’t serve the complaint.
The next step, he said, is to file a formal motion with the
court seeking the default judgment against the  Internet company 
and the People’s Republic.  The ministry is “making this blanket argument that
Baidu.com can enjoy the protection of sovereignty,” Preziosi
said in an interview.  “Baidu.com has not responded and they are very much aware
this lawsuit is pending,” he said. “Baidu.com is an arm of the
People’s Republic of China.”  The case is Zhang v. Baidu.com, 11-03388, U.S. District
Court,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
