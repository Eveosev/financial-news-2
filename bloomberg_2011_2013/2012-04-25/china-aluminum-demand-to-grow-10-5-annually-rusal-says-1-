China â€™s aluminum consumption will
grow at an annual rate of 10.5 percent to 27.5 million tons by
2015 amid continuous urbanization and investment in
infrastructure and construction, said Rusal Marketing GmbH.  Growth will slow from the 17.2 percent rate during 2005 and
2010, Chief Executive Officer Steve Hodgson said in a speech at
a Metal Bulletin conference in Shanghai. China is unlikely to
support Asian demand for primary aluminum and may reduce demand
from the region with rising exports of semi-finished products,
he said.  Rusal will invest in a company in Shenzhen to act as its
trading vehicle in China, Hodgson said. It agreed in November to
buy a stake in an affiliate of China North Industries Corp., or
Norinco.  Aluminum on the London Metal Exchange has climbed 3.3
percent this year and traded at $2,087 a ton as of 11:59 a.m. in
 Shanghai .  To contact the reporter on this story:
