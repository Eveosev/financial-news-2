Elizaveta Malyshko, a grain analyst
at UkrAgroConsult, a Kiev-based agricultural researcher,
commented on the mad cow disease case in the U.S. and its
potential influence on corn sales from  Ukraine .  She spoke by phone from the capital Kiev today.  “At the moment, we see a risk only from a price side,
because wheat and corn on the Chicago exchange dropped after
news about mad cow disease in  California , despite other factors
which were supposed to push the prices up.”  “Ukraine’s corn price at a free-on-board basis in the
Black Sea ports is influenced by the Chicago exchange, and thus
its price may decline with some lag. As for corn exports from
Ukraine, U.S. news will not have any impact because our
traditional markets are far from the U.S. and cannot be
affected.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
