Andrei Sizov Jr., managing director
of Moscow-based SovEcon consultancy, commented on the discovery
of mad cow disease in the U.S. and its potential influence on
corn and soybean sales from  Russia , by phone from Moscow today.  “This won’t have any impact on Russia’s grains sales.”  “Russia does not export soybeans.”  “Corn will have record shipments of more than 1.5 million
metric tons in the current season.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
