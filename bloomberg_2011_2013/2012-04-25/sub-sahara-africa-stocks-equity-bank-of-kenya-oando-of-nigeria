and food products, advanced for a fifth day, the longest streak
of gains since July 29, surging 5 percent to 13.07 naira on
speculation the stock is undervalued, according to Lambeth Trust
and Investment Co.  Cadbury reported a profit of more than 3 billion naira ($19
million) in 2011, which has “stimulated the appetite” of
investors, David Adonri, chief executive officer of Lambeth
Trust, said by phone today. The stock is currently undervalued
and if Cadbury’s profit growth continues, the stock could rise
to 30 naira in a year, he said.  Equity Bank Ltd. (EQBNK)  , Kenya’s biggest lender by
customers, surged 4.9 percent to 21.25 shillings, the fifth day
of gains and the highest closing price since August, in
anticipation of first-quarter earnings scheduled to be announced
tomorrow.  Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE)  , the state-owned
reinsurer, rose 8.3 percent to 9.8 shillings, the highest since
June 8, after Business Daily reported the company will increase
its investment in the real estate industry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
