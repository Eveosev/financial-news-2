Federal Reserve officials reduced
their forecast for unemployment after payroll gains averaged
more than 200,000 a month during the first quarter, while policy
makers affirmed a plan to keep the benchmark lending rate around
zero at least through late 2014.  Officials forecast the  unemployment rate  would average 7.8
percent to 8 percent in the final three months of this year
versus a forecast of 8.2 percent to 8.5 percent in January,
according to central tendency estimates. The new forecasts are
still far above policy makers’ estimates for full employment,
which range from 4.9 percent to 6 percent.  Unemployment is forecast at 7.3 percent to 7.7 percent next
year and 6.7 percent to 7.4 percent in 2014. The gradual return
of the jobless rate to a level Fed officials view as being in
line with full employment may explain why the Federal Open
Market Committee today restated its plan to pursue a zero-
interest-rate policy for another two-and-a-half years.  Seven of 17 Fed officials expect borrowing costs to remain
below 1 percent at the end of 2014, compared with nine in
January, while 10 expected rates to be 1 percent or higher,
versus eight in January. The Fed has kept the benchmark lending
rate close to zero since December 2008.  The Fed released the expectations of the five Fed board
members and 12 district bank presidents after the FOMC today
said it expects “economic growth to remain moderate over coming
quarters and then to pick up gradually.”  Central Tendency  Ten officials vote on the policy statement, while the
interest-rate and economic projections reflect the views of all
17 Fed officials. The so-called central tendency economic
forecasts exclude the three highest and three lowest
projections.  Prices as measured by the personal consumption expenditures
price index are seen rising 1.9 percent to 2 percent this year,
versus a gain of 1.4 percent to 1.8 percent in January. A 17
percent increase in the cost of unleaded gasoline, according to
data tracked by AAA, has pushed price measures higher this year.
U.S. central bankers have defined their inflation target as 2
percent a year.  Recent economic reports indicate that consumer spending and
services are gaining strength as manufacturing cools.  Bookings for goods meant to last at least three years
dropped 4.2 percent, more than forecast and the biggest decrease
since January 2009,  data  from the Commerce Department showed
today. Sales of non-military capital equipment excluding planes
climbed for a second month.  Retail sales in March rose more than forecast, and the
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index in the week ended April 15
matched the highest level in four years.  Limit Gains  A slowing labor market may limit further gains in household
demand. Payroll growth slowed in March to 120,000 jobs, the
smallest gain in five months. The unemployment rate fell to 8.2
percent from 8.3 percent as people left the  labor force .  Fed officials estimated the economy will expand 2.4 percent
to 2.9 percent this year, compared with a January forecast of
2.2 percent to 2.7 percent. They see growth of 2.7 percent to
3.1 percent in 2013 and 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent in 2014.  To contact the reporters on this story:
