Konecranes Oyj (KCR1V) , the world’s biggest
supplier of industrial cranes, climbed the most in almost three
months, boosted by a record order book.  Konecranes rose as much as 8.5 percent, the most since Feb.
2, adding 7.2 percent to 22.70 euros at the close of trading in
Helsinki. It was the day’s biggest gain on the OMX Helsinki 25
index. The shares extended their rise to 56 percent so far this
year, the third-biggest increase on the  Stoxx Europe 600. (SXXP)   Konecranes is benefiting from an increase in global
container traffic, which boosts port handling volumes and demand
for lifting equipment.  The Hyvinkaa, Finland-based company’s order book is at “an
all-time high,” Chief Executive Officer Pekka Lundmark said at
a briefing in Helsinki today. The order book rose 12.4 percent
to 1.08 billion euros ($1.4 billion) from a year ago.  Sales grew by 22.2 percent to 474 million euros and
operating profit rose by 29.4 percent to 24 million euros from a
year earlier. These were “good achievements,” Lundmark said in
a statement today.  Lundmark will relocate to  Singapore  in August for a year as
the company expands in  emerging markets . The relative share of
the Asia-Pacific region in Konecranes’ sales has doubled in 10
years to 20 percent.  The company reiterated forecast of sales and operating
profit rising in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
