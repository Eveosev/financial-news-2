LCH Clearnet Ltd.,  Europe ’s biggest
 clearing house , raised the extra deposit it demands from clients
to trade some Spanish and French government bonds.  The margin needed for Spanish bonds due in 3.25 years to
4.75 years will be increased to 4.9 percent from 4.4 percent,
according to information posted on LCH Clearnet’s website today.
The rate for securities due between seven years and 10 years was
boosted to 11.2 percent from 8.4 percent. LCH raised margins for
all Spanish securities maturing between 2 years and 15 years,
the statement showed.  LCH Clearnet increased the so-called deposit factor for
French bonds maturing from 10 years to 15 years, to 6.4 percent
from 6.1 percent. Margins on all other French securities, and
all Italian bonds, were left unchanged.  A London-based spokeswoman for LCH Clearnet confirmed the
changes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
