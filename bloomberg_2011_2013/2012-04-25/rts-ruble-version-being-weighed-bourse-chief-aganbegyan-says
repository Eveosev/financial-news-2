A ruble version of the dollar-
denominated  Russian Trading System Index (RTSI$)  may be created,
according to Micex-RTS President Ruben Aganbegyan.  The exchange, which was formed out of the merger of the
ruble-denominated Micex and the RTS in December, is considering
whether investors in the index want the option of hedging
currency exposure in rubles, Aganbegyan said at a press
breakfast in  London  yesterday.  “What we hear from a lot of international participants is
that basically they wouldn’t mind if the market is traded in
local currency,” Aganbegyan said. “That means that the index
should also be in local currency and investors should choose
their own options in FX.”  The exchange will make a decision soon, he said.  Micex-RTS will introduce other measures designed to boost
trading volume this year, including extending the period for
settling trades to three days and the creation of a central
securities depositary, Aganbegyan said.  Rules governing Russian pension funds may also be changed
this year to allow them to invest more of their funds in stocks,
he said.  The 30-day average value traded on the Micex-RTS was $792
million compared with $1.2 billion in trades in shares of 10 of
 Russia ’s biggest companies in London, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
