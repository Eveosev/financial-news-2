JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s biggest beef
producer, advanced the most in a week as concern eased that a
case of mad-cow disease reported in the U.S. may hurt the
company’s units in  North America .  JBS gained 4.2 percent to 7.46 reais at the close in Sao
Paulo, the most since April 18. The Bovespa index rose 0.4
percent. The beef producer’s shares fell as much as 5.2 percent
yesterday after the U.S. Agriculture Department confirmed the
illness in a dairy cow in central California before it could
enter the human food chain.  “At first, when people hear ‘mad cow,’ there’s panic,”
Caue Pinheiro, an analyst at SLW Corretora brokerage, said by
phone from  Sao Paulo . “What so far is just one isolated case
won’t affect the company. It’s an alert, but, if no other cases
are found, it shouldn’t be a big issue.”  JBS, which produces more than a third of its beef in the
U.S., said in a regulatory filing today that the case won’t
affect its business.  Mexico’s Agriculture Ministry expects its cattle trade with
the U.S. to remain unchanged, and European Union spokesman
 Frederic Vincent  said the EU plans no measures in response to
the case.  To contact the reporter on this story:
