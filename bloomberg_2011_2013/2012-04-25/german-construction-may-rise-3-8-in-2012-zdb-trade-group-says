Construction in  Germany  is likely
to increase 3.8 percent in 2012, with stronger demand for new
apartments making up for weaker government orders, Germany’s
largest builders’ trade group said.  The industry is expected to charge 6.7 percent more for
apartment construction than it did last year and 4.1 percent
more for commercial projects, the  Zentralverband Deutsches
Baugewerbe , or ZDB, said in a statement today. Revenue from
government projects was forecast to remain unchanged.  “Construction companies are seeing a hopeful start to the
year,” ZDB President Hans-Hartwig Loewenstein said in prepared
remarks for a press conference today.  Low unemployment, cheap financing and rising incomes are
boosting demand for new homes, Loewenstein said. Orders are also
being buoyed by investors seeking safety amid  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis.  The ZDB’s 35,000 members account for about 70 percent of
German construction revenue.
