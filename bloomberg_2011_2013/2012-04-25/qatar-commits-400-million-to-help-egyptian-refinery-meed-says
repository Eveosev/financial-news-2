Qatar is providing $400 million to
support  Egypt ’s Mostorod refinery project, which has been
stalled since former President Hosni Mubarak’s ouster in
February last year,  MEED reported .  State-run Qatar Petroleum is providing $300 million in
equity, and Qatar National Bank, which counts the emirate’s
government as its biggest shareholder, is providing $100 million
in loans, MEED reported today, citing unnamed people involved in
the effort. The Qatari funding ensures that the project will
reach its financial close in May, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
