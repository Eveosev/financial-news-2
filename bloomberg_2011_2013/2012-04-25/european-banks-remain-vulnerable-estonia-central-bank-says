European banks remain vulnerable
and the region’s governments need to continue with austerity
measures to overcome their debt crisis, the Estonian central
bank said.  The causes of the debt crisis haven’t disappeared, even as
the long-term refinancing operations of the  European Central
Bank  have “somewhat” eased the tensions in financial markets
at the beginning of the year, the Tallinn-based Eesti Pank said
in an e-mailed statement today.  “The partly fragile European banking sector and a weak
economic growth outlook show that  Europe ’s financial system
remains vulnerable and the debt crisis isn’t over,” the bank
said. “Thus the governments in the euro area need to continue
reforms and budget consolidation necessary for solving the
crisis as the long-term loans offered to banks by the euro
system is a temporary measure.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
