The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of
five-year notes may draw a  yield  of 0.905 percent, according to
the average forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 11 of the
 Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in April 2017, yielded 0.895
percent in pre-auction trading. The notes sold at a record low
auction yield of 0.88 percent at the Dec. 20 sale. Bids for
today’s offering are due by 11:30 a.m. New York time.  Today’s offering is the same size as the past 19 monthly
five-year debt auctions.  The March five-year note sale’s bid-to-cover  ratio , which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.85, compared with the 2.88 average ratio at the
past 10 offerings.  Indirect bidders,  an investor category that includes
foreign central banks, purchased 41.9 percent of the notes at
the March offering, compared with the 10-auction average of 43.5
percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary dealers that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 11.3 percent of the
securities at last month’s offering. That compares with the
average of 12.1 percent at the past 10 sales.  Five-year notes have returned 0.5 percent this year,
compared with a 0.04 percent gain for the broader Treasury
market, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Today’s auction is the second of three note sales totaling
$99 billion this week. The U.S. sold $35 billion of two-year
notes yesterday at a yield of 0.27 percent, with a bid-to-cover
of 3.76, the most since November 2011. The Treasury will auction
$29 billion of seven-year securities tomorrow.  This week’s note offerings combined with the April 19
auction of $16 billion in five-year Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities will raise $56.7 billion of new cash, as maturing
securities held by the public total $58.3 billion.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in U.S. debt auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
