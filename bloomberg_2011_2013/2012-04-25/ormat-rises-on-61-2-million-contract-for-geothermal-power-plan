Ormat Technologies Inc. (ORA) , a U.S.
geothermal energy company, rose the most in two months after
receiving a $61.2 million contract to build a power plant in
North America.  Ormat rose 2.7 percent to 18.78 at the close in  New York ,
the most since Feb. 24. The Reno-based company will provide two
air-cooled converters under an engineering, procurement and
construction contract it announced today in a statement.  The plant is expected to be completed in 2013. Smadar Lavi,
Ormat’s vice president of corporate finance and investor
relations, didn’t name the owner or provide additional details
in an e-mail today.  The contract will add to Ormat’s backlog, which reached
$240 million in the fourth quarter.  Ormat is a unit of Yavne, Israel-based  Ormat Industries
Ltd. (ORMT) , which rose 0.65 percent to 18.52 shekels in Tel Aviv
