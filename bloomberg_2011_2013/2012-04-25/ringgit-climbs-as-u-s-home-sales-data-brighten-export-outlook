Malaysia’s ringgit advanced for a
second straight day on optimism a recovery in the U.S. will spur
demand for exports from  Southeast Asia ’s third-biggest economy.  New homes in the U.S. were sold at a 328,000 annual rate in
March, compared with the 319,000 pace forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey. Another report showed  home prices  in 20 U.S. cities
dropped at a slower pace in the year through February, pointing
to stabilization in the real-estate market.  “The U.S. recovery is adding to confidence that export-
oriented Asian countries will benefit from the firmer growth,”
said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings Bhd. in
Kuala Lumpur. “That has helped to shore up Asian currencies.”  The ringgit gained 0.2 percent to 3.0600 per dollar as of
4:08 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-
rate swings used to price options, dropped 10 basis points to
5.85 percent.  Government bonds  declined. The yield on the 3.434 percent
notes due August 2014 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.11 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
