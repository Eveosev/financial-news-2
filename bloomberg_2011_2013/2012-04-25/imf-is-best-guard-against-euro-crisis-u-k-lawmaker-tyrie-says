The  International Monetary Fund 
remains the best backstop against a further deterioration in the
euro-area economy given the region’s “flawed” framework for
dealing with crises, said  Andrew Tyrie , the chairman of
Parliament’s Treasury Committee.  Sustained by “sticking plaster bailouts,” the crisis in
Europe risks spreading to the whole world, the Conservative
Party lawmaker will say in a speech in  London  today. Other
countries won’t be able to rely on the 17 euro-area nations to
“do the hard work for us.”  The IMF is “the only global fire brigade we have,” Tyrie
will say, according to remarks released by his office. “That is
why it was right to increase their resources.”  European policy makers were urged at the weekend to be
tougher and more agile in their efforts to end two years of debt
turmoil as the IMF won more than $430 billion to safeguard the
world economy.  Finance chiefs from the  Group of 20  stressed that  Europe 
must now justify the show of solidarity by doing even more to
restore fiscal health, help banks and spur economic growth.
Failure to do so could make it harder for countries such as
Spain to secure aid if they falter and imperil a global recovery
the G-20 labeled modest and subject to downside risks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
