Japan ’s government bond futures may
decline toward a two-week low, SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. said,
citing trading patterns.  Futures for June delivery yesterday rose to 143.04, the
highest level for a lead contract on an intraday basis since
Feb. 14, when the  Bank of Japan (8301)  unexpectedly eased monetary
policy. The contract’s relative strength index signals that
gains have been too rapid, according to Makoto Noji, a Tokyo-
based senior debt and currency strategist at the unit of Japan’s
third-largest publicly traded bank by assets.  The RSI for the bond futures touched 68.5 on April 23, the
most since August. It was 62.4 at the close of trading in  Tokyo 
yesterday. Readings above 70 suggest the contract is overbought.  “With its RSI approaching 70, the contract may be poised
for a downward correction,” Noji said.  Bond futures may decline toward their 50-day and 100-day
moving averages at about 142.30, the lowest level since April
10, Noji said. The 50-day and 100-day averages were at 142.29
and 142.33 yesterday respectively. Futures were little changed
at 142.77 as of 9:35 a.m. at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
