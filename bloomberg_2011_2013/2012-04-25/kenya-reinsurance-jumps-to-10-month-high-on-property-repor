Kenya Reinsurance Corp. (KNRE) , the state-
owned reinsurer, jumped to its highest in more than 10 months
after   Business Daily  reported it will increase its investment
in the property industry.  Kenya Re, as the company is known, gained 8.3 percent to
9.80 shillings at the 3 p.m. close in Nairobi, the highest since
June 8.  The company is planning to build a 1.5 billion-shilling
($18 million) office in the capital’s Upper Hill business
district, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported, citing Managing
Director Jadiah Mwarania.  The plan marks “a return to property development as it
eyes bigger returns from the real estate sector,” Nairobi-based
Old Mutual Securities Ltd. said in an e-mailed note to clients.  Full-year profit climbed 24 percent to 1.91 billion
shillings, Kenya Re said April 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
