A blast in a Bahraini village
injured four policemen accompanying civil defense workers who
were putting out a fire in a vandalized shop, the  Interior
Ministry  reported on its website last night.  The explosion occurred at 10:35 p.m. in the village of
Deraz, the ministry said, citing the General Directorate of
Northern Governorate Police. It called the blast a “terror”
act. Deraz, west of the capital Manama, is a Shiite Muslim
village that has been the site of frequent clashes between
protesters and security forces.  Bahrain quashed a month of mass rallies last year by mostly
Shiite demonstrators demanding equal rights and representation.
Small rallies still take place regularly in Shiite
neighborhoods, sometimes spilling into commercial areas of
Manama.  To contact the reporter on this story:
