A lawyer for the late Alec
Wildenstein, brother to the current head of the family art
business, was charged in February with  money laundering  by an
investigating judge leading a probe of tax fraud allegations
against the family,  Challenges  said, citing unnamed sources.  Olivier Riffaud is contesting a 750,000 euro ($991,275)
bail set as a condition for his release, the magazine said.  Riffaud acted as tax lawyer and notary for Wildenstein when
he moved back to  France  in 2004. He was in charge of settling a
review of whether his client’s lifestyle could be covered by his
declared income and whether Wildenstein may have hidden money
from tax authorities, the magazine said.  Riffaud didn’t immediately return calls by Bloomberg News
to his Paris office for comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
