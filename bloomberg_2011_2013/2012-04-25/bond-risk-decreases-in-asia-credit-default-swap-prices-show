The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds from non-payment decreased in Asia, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 1.5 basis points to 163 basis
points as of 8:29 a.m. in Hong Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices
show. The gauge is on course for its lowest close since April
17, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell 0.5 basis points to 178
as of 9:50 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is set for its first fall since April 19, according to
CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and compiles prices quoted
by dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The Australian market is closed today for a public holiday.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
