Suntec Real Estate Investment Trust (SUN) ,
a Singapore property trust partly owned by billionaire Li Ka-
shing, climbed to the highest in more than seven months after
reporting a 2.7 percent increase in its payout to shareholders.  The stock rose 1.2 percent to S$1.30, the highest since
Sept. 12, at the close in Singapore. The trust yesterday
reported a distribution per unit of 2.453 Singapore cents for
the quarter ended March 31 of 2012.  Suntec’s  earnings  are increasing as office rents in the
city-state advanced to the highest in three years at the end of
2011, based on  government data . The property trust owns stakes
in the city’s biggest downtown office developments, including
One Raffles Quay and Marina Bay Financial Centre.  “The leasing of  office space  in both One Raffles Quay and
Marina Bay Financial Centre went better than expected,” TiWee
Pang, a Singapore-based analyst at DMG & Partners Securities Pte
with a buy recommendation, said in a note today. “We are
confident that Suntec’s office portfolio will outperform the
general office market industry in Singapore.”  Distributable income increased 3.8 percent to $54.9 million,
for the quarter ended March, Suntec said.  The property trust also owns Suntec City, one of
Singapore’s largest integrated developments with office towers,
a mall and convention center. It also holds a third of One
Raffles Quay and Marina Bay Financial Centre Towers 1 and 2 and
the Marina Bay Link Mall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
