Intel Corp., (INTC)  the world’s largest
maker of computer chips, will fight a 1.06 billion-euro ($1.4
billion) antitrust fine by European Union regulators at a July
court hearing.  Intel’s challenge at the EU’s General Court will be heard
over four days from July 3 to July 6, according to a
spokesperson for the Luxembourg-based tribunal who couldn’t be
identified in line with official policy.  Intel is seeking to overturn a 2009 decision from the
European Commission that said Intel’s use of rebates violated EU
antitrust rules. The Santa Clara, California based company
believes the commission “was mistaken in its findings” and is
availing of its right to appeal, spokesman  Chuck Mulloy  said in
an e-mail.  The antitrust fine was the biggest ever issued by the EU,
more than double the 497 million-euro penalty against  Microsoft
Corp. (MSFT)  in 2004.  Advanced Micro Devices Inc., (AMD)  which initiated the
EU antitrust case, had struggled to overcome Intel’s hold on the
market for processors that run PCs.  Antoine Colombani, a spokesman for the EU regulator,
declined to comment.  Decisions by the EU court can be appealed a last time to
the  European Court of Justice , the 27-nation bloc’s highest
court, which is also in Luxembourg.  The case is T-286/09 Intel v Commission.  To contact the reporter on this story:
