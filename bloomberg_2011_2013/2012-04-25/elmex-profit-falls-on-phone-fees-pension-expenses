Telefonos de Mexico SAB, the fixed-
line unit of  America Movil SAB (AMXL) , reported a 7.3 percent decline
in first-quarter profit after cutting fees for calls to mobile
phones and spending more on its pension fund.  Net income  dropped  to 3.48 billion pesos ($264 million), or
19 centavos a share, from 3.76 billion pesos, or 21 centavos, a
year earlier. Sales slid 3.5 percent to 26.6 billion pesos.  Telmex, as the Mexico City-based company is known, cut
prices for calls to mobile lines after Mexican regulators forced
wireless carriers last year to reduce their fees. The reduction
cut Telmexâ€™s revenue from interconnection charges by 42 percent
to 1.83 billion pesos.  Pension-fund contributions and higher labor costs helped
push expenses up 2 percent to 17 billion pesos. Telmex closed
the quarter with 14.6 million phone lines, down 6.3 percent from
a year earlier, and 8.1 million high-speed Internet connections,
up 6.8 percent.  Telmex rose 0.2 percent to 10.13 pesos yesterday in Mexico
City before the results were announced.  America Movil ,
controlled by billionaire  Carlos Slim , gained 1 percent to 16.64
pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
