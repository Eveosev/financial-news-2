Goldcorp Inc. (G) , the second-largest
gold producer by market value, reported first-quarter earnings
that trailed analysts’ estimates as production declined at a
Canadian mine. The shares fell the most in more than two years.  Net income  fell 26 percent to $479 million, or 51 cents a
share, from $651 million, or 81 cents, a year earlier, the
Vancouver-based company said yesterday in a statement. Profit
excluding mark-to-market gains on securities and other one-time
items was 50 cents a share, less than the 53-cent average of 18
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales climbed 11 percent to
$1.35 billion.  The company said gold output dropped 39 percent at Red Lake
in Ontario, its top producer, because of difficult ground
conditions and lower-than-expected grades. The company produced
524,700 ounces of gold at all its mines in the first quarter,
compared with 637,600 ounces a year earlier.  George Topping , a
Toronto-based analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., had estimated
production of 572,400 ounces.  The company will complete a review of the production plan
at Red Lake by midyear, Chief Executive Officer Chuck Jeannes
said yesterday in a telephone interview. He said it’s too early
to say whether the company will need to revise its output and
cost forecasts. The ground problems probably aren’t “very
serious,” he said.  “We’ve experienced these kinds of things in the past,”
Jeannes said. “We’ll have a much better sense by the end of the
second quarter where we stand.”  Shares Drop  Goldcorp dropped 6 percent to C$38.02 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest decline since July 28, 2009. The 64-company
S&P/TSX  Global Gold Index (SPTSGD)  fell less than 0.1 percent.  Goldcorp said in January it expected to produce 2.6 million
ounces of gold this year at costs of $550 to $600 an ounce. The
company plans to boost annual production by about 70 percent to
4.2 million ounces by 2016, as new mines start up in the
 Dominican Republic ,  Argentina  and  Canada .  All the projects are still on schedule, Jeannes said.  Goldcorp said its average cost to produce and sell gold
increased in the first quarter, primarily because of lower gold
production. So-called co-product cash costs were $648 an ounce
in the quarter compared with $504 a year earlier, the company
said. Brian Yu, an analyst at Citigroup Inc. in  San Francisco ,
had estimated average costs of $571 an ounce. Stifel’s Topping
estimated $628.  ‘Dragged Down’  Goldcorp’s results were “dragged down by poor production
at Red Lake,” Topping said in a telephone interview yesterday.  Red Lake is the “cornerstone on which the company has been
built,” Topping said. “It’s very important, it is their high-
grade, low-cost operation.”  Jeannes said mergers and acquisitions in the gold sector
may accelerate as potential targets look cheaper.  “With the valuations having come down, it’s probably more
likely that you will see activity in the sector,” he said.  “We’re not stressed to go out and buy anything, but we
always keep our eyes open,” he said.  Gold, which has risen for 11 straight years, averaged
$1,694 in the first quarter in  New York , 22 percent more than a
year earlier. Futures for June delivery rose 0.9 percent to
$1,657.80 an ounce at 10:38 a.m. on the Comex.  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) , based in Toronto, is the world’s
largest producer of the metal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
