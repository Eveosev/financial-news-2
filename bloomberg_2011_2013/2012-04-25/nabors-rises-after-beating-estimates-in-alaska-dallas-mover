Nabors Industries Ltd. (NBR) , the world’s
largest land-rig drilling contractor, rose the most in more than
two months after announcing new asset sales and beating
analysts’ estimates on better performance in  Alaska .  Shares climbed 6.3 percent to $16.96 at the close in  New
York , the most since Feb. 22. First-quarter adjusted per-share
earnings from continuing operations of 65 cents were 15 cents
higher than the average of 27 analysts’  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Revenue climbed 31 percent to $1.84 billion, the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company said in a statement yesterday.  Nabors said it wanted to sell as much as $800 million of
oil and natural-gas assets and business units this year and
focus on drilling and production services after former Chief
Operating Officer Tony Petrello took over as the top executive
in October.  The new CEO’s restructuring plan is working,  Scott Gruber ,
an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co., said in a note to
investors today. “The beat was fairly broad-based with
particular strength in U.S. land, U.S. offshore and Alaska.”  Nabors signed long-term contracts for nine new-build rigs,
according to the statement. The contracts “should support
future income generation even as rates soften,” Gruber wrote.  Nabors closed sales of exploration and production assets in
 Colombia  and several minor working interests in the U.S. for $77
million. The company sold parts of its rig-moving business in
the the U.S. for about $13.5 million, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
