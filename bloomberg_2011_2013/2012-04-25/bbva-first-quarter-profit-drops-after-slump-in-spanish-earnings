Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA) ,
Spain’s second-biggest bank, posted higher-than-estimated first-
quarter profit as earnings from  emerging markets  helped offset a
slump in its home country.  Net income  fell to 1 billion euros ($1.32 billion) from
1.15 billion euros a year ago, the Bilbao, Spain-based bank said
today in a filing to regulators. That beat the 936.7 million-
euro average  estimate  in a Bloomberg survey of 15 analysts.  BBVA, which has about 60 percent of its lending  in Spain ,
is among banks being forced by the government to book more
losses for real estate as the recession threatens to drive up
bad loans. Earnings from South America and  Asia  helped counter a
52 percent drop in profit from Spain, where costs for
provisioning impaired assets rose.  “Under the circumstances, these are pretty resilient
results at the operating level,” said Daragh Quinn, an analyst
at Nomura International in  Madrid . “The pressures on the
Spanish business are still very much there, but there’s no sign
that things are getting worse at a faster pace.”  BBVA shares rose 2.2 percent to 5.26 euros in Madrid,
paring this year’s decline to 20 percent and valuing the lender
at 27.2 billion euros. Larger rival  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , which
has dropped 13 percent, will report earnings tomorrow.  BBVA said it met the 9 percent capital requirement set by
the European Banking Authority ahead of a June deadline. BBVA’s
core capital ratio, a  measure  of financial strength, climbed to
10.7 percent from 10.3 percent in December.  Bad Loans  Net interest income rose 13 percent to 3.6 billion euros as
gross lending increased 3.4 percent and deposits fell 1.8
percent, the bank said. Trading income dropped to 367 million
euros from 752 million euros a year earlier.  Bad loans were 4 percent of total lending, a ratio that was
unchanged from December, said BBVA. Gross loans newly classified
as in default reached 3.1 billion euros compared with 3.6
billion euros in the fourth quarter and 2.8 billion euros a year
earlier.  Costs for covering asset impairments rose to 1.09 billion
euros from 1.02 billion euros a year ago. The lender estimates
it will cost 1.5 billion euros to comply with the government’s
order and said it made gross provisions of 174 million euros
toward that goal in the first quarter.  Trends for bad loans remain broadly stable except in loans
to companies where the default ratio rose about 60 basis points
in the quarter to 9.8 percent, Chief Operating Officer Angel
Cano said on a webcast.  Earnings from  Spain  fell by more than half to 229 million
euros from a year ago, BBVA said. Net lending in Spain dropped
1.8 percent and deposits declined 8.4 percent.  Mexican Boost  The bad loans ratio for the division rose to 4.9 percent
from 4.8 percent in December, according to the lender.
Provisioning costs jumped to 613 million euros from 422 million
euros a year ago.  Profit from  Mexico , the biggest contributor to BBVA’s
earnings, rose 0.5 percent to 430 million euros, the bank said.
Earnings from Eurasia, a division that pools BBVA’s business in
 Turkey  and  China  and its operations in  Europe  outside Spain,
climbed 52 percent to 299 million euros. Profit from  South
America  increased 33 percent to 370 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
