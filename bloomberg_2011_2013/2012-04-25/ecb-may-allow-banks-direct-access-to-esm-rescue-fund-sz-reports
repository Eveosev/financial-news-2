The  European Central Bank  and
countries that use the euro are working on an initiative to
allow cash-strapped banks direct acccess to funding from the
European Stability Mechanism,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported in a
preview of that will appear today.  The working group will examine how banks can directly
access the funding within the next two weeks, the newspaper
said. The move comes amid growing concern that Spanish banks are
increasingly unable to lend to companies and that the crisis may
spread to other euro countries, SZ reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
