Asian  stocks  rose, with the
regional benchmark index headed for its first advance in five
days, as corporate profits beat estimates and U.S. housing data
added to signs the world’s biggest economy is improving  Samsung Electronics Co., Asia’s largest consumer
electronics maker, rose 1.7 percent in Seoul.  Hon Hai Precision
Industry Co. (2317) , a maker of Apple Inc. products, added 2.4 percent
in Taipei after the U.S. company’s profit almost doubled. Nomura
Holdings Inc.,  Japan ’s largest brokerage, rose 2.4 percent on
speculation it may post higher net income. Yoshinoya Holdings
Co., a restaurant chain that imports beef, fell 2.4 percent in
 Tokyo  after a case of mad-cow disease was reported in the U.S.  “A recovery trend on earnings is being seen,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc. “The  U.S. economy  is still in mild recovery.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  gained 0.3 percent to 123.61 as
of 5:11 p.m. in Tokyo, with almost three shares rising for every
two that fell. Trading volumes in Tokyo and  Hong Kong  were at
least 28 percent lower than the 30-day average, while those in
 Shanghai  were 41 percent higher. The gauge declined the past
four days as political instability in  Europe  deepened concern
governments will struggle to contain the region’s debt crisis
and amid signs  China ’s economy is slowing.  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  advanced 1 percent and
Taiwan’s Taiex Index added 0.9 percent. China’s Shanghai
Composite Index rose 0.8 percent, reversing losses of as much as
0.5 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index lost 0.2 percent. South
Korea’s Kospi Index lost 0.1 percent. Markets in  Australia  and
New Zealand were closed for holidays.  India Credit Outlook  India’s Sensitive Index dropped 1 percent, heading for its
lowest close since Jan. 30, after the nation’s credit outlook
was cut to negative by  Standard & Poor’s , which cited risks from
slower economic growth and a widening current-account deficit.
The nation’s sovereign-debt rating is one step above junk status.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.7
percent today. The index gained 0.4 percent in  New York 
yesterday amid better-than-estimated earnings at companies from
AT&T Inc. to 3M Co. Apple earnings, which also beat analysts’
estimates, were released after the market closed.  Asian exporters advanced after a report showed the U.S.
housing market is stabilizing, with home prices in 20 cities
dropping in February at the slowest pace in 12 months and
stronger-than-expected sales of new homes in March.  Samsung Electronics (005930) , which gets 20 percent of sales from
the U.S., advanced 1.7 percent to 1.305 million won in Seoul.
Canon Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, gained 1.5 percent
to 3,800 yen in Tokyo. Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and
clothes to Wal-Mart Stores Inc., added 0.9 percent to HK$16.16
in Hong Kong.  Apple Boost  Technology companies posted the biggest advance among the
10 industry groups in MSCI Asia Pacific Index. Apple suppliers
gained after results from the Cupertino, California-based
company reflected robust demand for iPhones in China and sales
of the new iPad.  Net income in the fiscal second quarter climbed 94 percent
to $11.6 billion from a year earlier as sales rose 59 percent to
$39.2 billion, Apple said in a statement.  Hon Hai, which gets about 37 percent of its revenue from
Apple, increased 2.4 percent to NT$106 in Taipei.  Foxconn
Technology Co. (2354) , a unit of Hon Hai that supplies casings to the
U.S. company, rose 2.5 percent to NT$103.50.  LG Display Co., a maker of liquid-crystal displays that
counts Apple as a customer, gained 1.9 percent to 26,850 won in
Seoul as it predicted a return to profit in the three months
ending June after three quarters of losses.  Nomura Speculation  Nomura Holdings climbed 2.4 percent to 344 yen in Tokyo on
speculation Japan’s biggest brokerage may report an increase in
quarterly profit trading gains outweighed declines in investment
banking, according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  Net income climbed to about 18 billion yen ($221 million)
for the three months ended March 31 from 11.9 billion yen a year
earlier, the people said, declining to be identified before
earnings are announced on April 27. The average estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for profit of 14.4 billion
yen.  Among stocks that dropped, Yoshinoya slid 2.4 percent to
102,800 yen on concern a mad-cow case in the U.S. may hurt sales
at the restaurant chain, which imports meat for its beef bowls.
“There is no problem with our beef,” Haruhiko Kizu, a
Yoshinoya spokesman said by telephone today. He declined to
comment on the drop in the company’s shares.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  slumped 6.9 percent to 411.50 rupees in Mumbai
after India’s third-largest software exporter posted fourth-
quarter sales that missed estimates.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 8.3 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 9.1 percent advance by the
 S&P 500  and a 4 percent increase by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark were valued at 12.6 times
 estimated earnings  on average, compared with multiples of 13.1
for the S&P 500 and 10.6 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
