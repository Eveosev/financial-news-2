The  Atlanta Falcons  acquired former
Pro Bowl cornerback Asante Samuel today from the  Philadelphia
Eagles  for a seventh-round pick in the upcoming National
Football League draft.  The Eagles now have 10 picks in the league’s annual college
player draft, which starts tomorrow with the first round of
selections, the team said today in an e-mailed statement.  As part of the trade, the 31-year-old cornerback agreed to
a three-year, $18.5 million contract with the Falcons, ESPN
reported, citing an unidentified person.  “Asante Samuel is a good football player and you can never
have enough good players on your team,” Falcons coach Mike Smith said in an e-mailed statement. “Our game has become more
of a passing game, and you have to have the players who can
neutralize how offenses are trying to attack you.”  A  Pro Bowl  selection from 2007-2010, Samuel played the last
four seasons in Philadelphia. His exit comes one year after the
Eagles acquired  Nnamdi Asomugha  and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie,
giving the team three Pro Bowl cornerbacks.  Samuel has 45 interceptions and six forced fumbles in a
nine-year career with the Eagles and  New England Patriots . His
38 interceptions since 2006 lead the NFL, according to the
Falcons’ statement, though the three he recorded last year were
his fewest since 2005.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
