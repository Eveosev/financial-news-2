China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile phone company, posted first-
quarter profit that missed analysts’ estimates on weaker than
expected subscriber additions to its high-speed service.  Net income  rose to 1 billion yuan ($159 million), from a
restated 145 million yuan a year earlier, the Beijing-based
company said in a statement yesterday. That compared with the
1.1 billion yuan median of six analysts’ estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  China  Unicom (728)  Chairman Chang Xiaobing lost the advantage of
being the only carrier in China to offer  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone
with a service contract when China Telecom Corp. began sales of
the device March 9. China Unicom added 8.84 million users to its
third-generation network in the first quarter, which Macquarie
Group Ltd. analyst Lisa Soh called “a weak number.”  “At this stage it is unclear whether this 3G net adds
number was impacted by  China  Telecom’s iPhone launch,” Soh, a
Hong Kong-based analyst who rates the shares underperform, wrote
in an April 19 note to clients. “Unicom will need to incur
higher costs/lower average revenue per user to accelerate its 3G
run rate throughout the remainder of the year.”  Revenue rose 25 percent to 61.2 billion yuan in the first
quarter, from 49 billion yuan, beating the median estimate of
56.8 billion yuan in the Bloomberg News survey.  Unicom rose 0.2 percent to HK$13.02 at the close in Hong
Kong trading yesterday, before the announcement. The shares have
declined 20 percent this year.  3G Subscribers  China Unicom’s 3G subscribers totaled 48.9 million at the
end of March. The company lagged behind  China Mobile Ltd. (941) ’s 59.6
million 3G users, according to data the companies released this
month. Unicom’s total mobile customer base of 209.5 million was
less than half of China Mobile’s total of 667.2 million.  On April 20, China Mobile said first-quarter profit rose
3.5 percent, missing analyst estimates, as the world’s biggest
carrier by subscribers increased spending to attract users. Net
income climbed to 27.8 billion yuan, from 26.9 billion yuan a
year earlier. The median of four estimates by analysts in a
Bloomberg News survey was 28.2 billion yuan.  China Telecom, the country’s biggest fixed-line carrier and
third-largest mobile phone company, will publish earnings on
April 27.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
