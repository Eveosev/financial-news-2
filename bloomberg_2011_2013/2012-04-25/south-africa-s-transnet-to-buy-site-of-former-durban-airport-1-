Transnet SOC Ltd., operator of
 South Africa ’s ports and railways, will acquire the site of the
former Durban International Airport to build a new port,
Transport Minister Sibusiso Ndebele said.  The project forms part of a government plan to improve
transport links between the eastern port city and Gauteng, the
country’s central industrial area, by 2050. Other key
initiatives announced by Ndebele today include the construction
of a dry port at Cato Ridge near Durban and the extension of
commuter rail services to the town of Pietermaritzburg some 68
kilometers (42 miles) east of the city.  The government is prioritizing “the Durban-Johannesburg
corridor transport improvements,” Ndebele told lawmakers in
Cape Town. Preliminary estimates so far indicate that 100
billion rand ($12.9 billion) would be needed for the port-
development precinct and a half-trillion rand for the entire
corridor, he said.  Ndebele didn’t provide details on how projects would be
financed or give time frames for their completion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
