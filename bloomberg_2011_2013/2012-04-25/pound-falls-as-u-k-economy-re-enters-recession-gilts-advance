The pound dropped from a seven-
month high against the dollar after the U.K. economy
unexpectedly slipped back into recession, backing the case for
the  Bank of England  to extend its asset-purchase program.  The U.K. currency fell the most in two months against the
euro after the  Office for National Statistics  said gross
domestic product shrank 0.2 percent last quarter, after
contracting 0.3 percent in the previous three months. Economists
surveyed by Bloomberg forecast growth of 0.1 percent. Standard
Chartered Plc said it was ending its bet the euro would drop
against the pound after the “unexpectedly weak” growth report.
Gilts declined.  “The pound is clearly selling off on the back of this
data,” said  John Hydeskov , chief analyst at Danske Bank A/S in
 London . “It could be the point where investors say ‘Hang on,
are we really buying the currency from an economy also in
recession, just like the  euro zone ?’”  The pound weakened 0.1 percent to $1.6130 at 4:17 p.m.
London time after rising to $1.6171, the highest since Sept. 6.
The U.K. currency fell 0.1 percent to 81.80 pence per euro after
dropping as much as 0.6 percent, the most since Feb. 22. It
reached 81.44 pence yesterday, the strongest since August 2010.  Short-sterling futures advanced after the GDP report as
investors cut bets on higher  interest rates . The implied yield
on the contract expiring in June 2013 dropped four basis points
to 1.09 percent.  U.K. policy makers kept their  benchmark rate  at 0.5 percent
at their April 4-5 meeting. Bank of England officials will
consider whether to extend their 325 billion-pound quantitative-
easing  program  when they next meet on May 9-10.  Scrapping Bets  The growth report “has tempered expectations the economy
will outperform,” Ned Rumpeltin, head of Group-of-10 currency
strategy at  Standard Chartered  in London, wrote today in a note
to clients. “Fundamentals still imply further medium-term
declines, however we will look to re-enter at better levels,”
he said.  The yield on the 10-year gilt climbed four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2.14 percent. The 4 percent bond due
March 2022 declined 0.43, or 4.30 pounds per 1,000 pound face
amount, to 116.45.  “Today’s U.K. GDP data was very bad,”  Geoff Kendrick ,
head of European currency strategy at Nomura International Plc
in London, wrote in an e-mailed note. “However, with the U.K.
remaining AAA, I think the bigger issue is that despite negative
growth, buying gilts is still more attractive than buying
European paper.”  Poised to Fall  Ten-year gilt yields are poised to retreat after testing
above the 50-day moving average of 2.18 percent last week,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They may encounter so-
called resistance around their April low of 2.01 percent.
Resistance refers to a level where sell orders may be clustered.  Gilts have handed investors a loss of 1.2 percent this
year, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. That’s the
third worst performance among 26 sovereign markets tracked by
the indexes after Spain and  Greece .  Sterling has strengthened 1.6 percent in the past month,
the best performer among the 10 developed-nation currencies
tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro
dropped 0.9 percent, and the dollar slid 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
