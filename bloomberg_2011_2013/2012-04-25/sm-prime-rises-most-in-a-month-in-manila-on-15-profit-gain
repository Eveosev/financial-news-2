SM Prime Holdings Inc. (SMPH)  advanced the
most in more than a month after the largest Philippine shopping
mall operator’s first-quarter profit grew 15 percent and said
earnings growth would be sustained for the rest of the year.  The  stock  rose 2 percent to 17.12 pesos as of 11:17 a.m. in
 Manila , poised for the sharpest gain since March 16. First-
quarter  net income  climbed to 2.43 billion pesos ($57 million)
as sales increased 16 percent to 7.03 billion pesos, the Manila-
based company said in a statement yesterday.  A 15 percent profit growth “should be achievable moving
forward in 2012” as  consumer spending  is likely to improve,
Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Lim said yesterday.  SM Prime benefited from the addition of shopping malls in
the  Philippines  in the past two years and rising momentum from
its China operations, Lim said. Profit may rise 12 percent to
10.1 billion pesos this year, according to the average estimate
of 11 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The earnings report was “ahead of expectations,” Carl Sy,
a Manila-based analyst at Deutsche Bank AG., said in a note
yesterday. “SM Prime seems to be bucking its decade-long trend
of falling margins.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
