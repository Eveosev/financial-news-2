Aviva Plc (AV/) , the U.K.’s second-
biggest insurer by market value, said the chief executive
officer of its Russian unit will leave next month, the fourth
senior executive departure to be announced in the past week.  Andrey Dubinin will leave Aviva Russia to work from Geneva
for  UBS AG (UBSN) ’s Zurich-based wealth management division, he said
today in a telephone interview. His departure, scheduled for May
31, will be followed by the appointment of Chief Operating
Officer Dmitry Maksimov as interim CEO, spokesman Jon Bunn said
today by telephone.  Dubinin’s exit follows the departure of Aviva Europe CEO
Igal Mayer, who stepped down from the company’s board last week.
Richard Hoskins, CEO of  North America , and Alain Dromer, CEO of
Aviva Investors, will also leave the company, which is
reorganizing itself into development markets and higher growth
markets under group CEO Andrew Moss.  Aviva is the worst performing member of the  FTSE ASX Life
Insurance Index (FALIFE)  over the past 12 months as its investments in
European sovereign debt weigh on the shares. The company gets
about a third of its revenue from continental Europe.  The stock climbed 1.8 percent to 317.2 pence at 3:53 p.m.
in London today, valuing the firm at about 9.2 billion pounds
($15 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
