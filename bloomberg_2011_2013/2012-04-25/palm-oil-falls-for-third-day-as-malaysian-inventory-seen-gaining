Palm oil  declined for a third day
on speculation that inventories may gain on higher output in
 Malaysia , the second largest producer, and falling exports.  The July-delivery contract retreated as much as 0.3 percent
to 3,453 ringgit ($1,127) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange and ended the morning session at 3,455
ringgit in Kuala Lumpur.  Production in Malaysia is typically low in January and
February and recovers from March onwards. Output gained 2.1
percent to 1.21 million tons last month from 1.19 million tons
in February, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said April 10.  “Improving production in Malaysia is the main reason the
market has been down this week,” Ryan Long, vice president of
futures and options at  OSK Holdings Bhd. (OSK) , said by phone from
Kuala Lumpur. “Production may be 7 percent to 9 percent higher
this month.”  Malaysia’s palm oil exports fell 2.9 percent to 1.04
million tons in the first 25 days of April from the same period
in March, surveyor Intertek said today.  “Demand is there and buyers are just waiting for the right
time to enter into the market,” Vijay Mehta, a director at
Commodity Links Pte., said by phone from  Singapore . “Soybean
oil is really expensive compared to palm oil, so the entire
dependency is on palm now.”  Soybean oil’s premium over palm oil climbed to $100.47 a
ton today from $98.33 yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Soybeans for July delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$14.73 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soybean oil for
the same month was little changed to 55.74 cents per pound.  Palm oil for September delivery fell 0.2 percent to 8,772
yuan ($1,392) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange . Soybean
oil for delivery in the same month gained 0.3 percent to 9,926
yuan.  To contact the reporters on this story:
