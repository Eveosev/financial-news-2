Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ’s Scion brand,
created to attract young drivers with quirky designs and low
prices, said many initial U.S. customers for the iQ minicar are
buying it as a fuel-saving third vehicle for urban trips.  The tiny hatchback, starting at $15,995, appeals to city
drivers because it’s easy to park and gets the best fuel-economy
of any gasoline-only auto in the U.S., Jack Hollis, vice
president of Scion sales, said in an interview yesterday. Sales
of iQ, which became available in all U.S. markets last month,
lifted Scion deliveries 19 percent in the year’s first quarter.  “The early indication is it’s more of a third vehicle, and
a little more of a higher-income buyer,” Hollis said. “This is
the highest mpg car in the country, non-hybrid, and what I think
is happening is people are seeing that.”  Toyota is adding the iQ, rated at 37 miles (60 kilometers)
per gallon of gasoline in combined city and highway driving, and
the new FR-S rear-wheel-drive sports car, due in June, to revive
flagging sales for Scion. The brand was created in 2003 to draw
younger customers to dealerships that also sell the company’s
namesake Toyota models. Scion sales peaked at 173,034 in 2006,
and dropped to 49,271 last year.  U.S. dealers should sell 10,000 FR-S models this year and
20,000 in 2013, Hollis said.  iQ Outlook  Sales of iQ this year have averaged 840 a month, in line
with Toyota’s target of 750 to 1,100, Hollis. Sales of the model
in April may be about 900 units, he said.  Web-based advertisements for the 120.1-inch (305 cm) long
car that’s two feet smaller than  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s
Mini Cooper show off both how  easily it can be parked  and its
tight turning radius is featured in a series of  “donut” videos 
with various people eating doughnuts and driving in sharp
circles.  Demand for iQs has been stronger than Toyota expected in
states including Texas, Florida and Georgia, and it is also
selling well in Chicago, Philadelphia and New York, Hollis said.  Fuel economy for competing mini-cars includes  Daimler AG (DAI) ’s
Smart fortwo, at 36 mpg combined; the Mini Cooper at 32 mpg; and
Chrysler Group LLC’s Fiat 500 at 33 mpg with a manual
transmission.  Toyota’s American depositary receipts rose 0.8 percent to
$81.36 at the close yesterday in New York. Scion is based in
Torrance, California, at Toyota’s U.S. sales unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
