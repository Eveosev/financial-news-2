Real Madrid coach  Jose Mourinho 
said he’ll stay at the Spanish soccer club after being linked
with the manager’s post at English Premier League team Chelsea
in media reports.  Real Madrid lost to  Bayern Munich  in a penalty shootout
last night in their Champions League semifinal. The 49-year-old
Portuguese coach was attempting to win the elite European club
competition with his third different team after victories with
Porto and Inter Milan.  “If the club thinks I can keep doing things -- and I know
they do -- I will continue,” Mourinho said at the Santiago
Bernabeu stadium last night after the loss. “This group still
has a lot of room to improve.”  Mourinho, in his second season at Real Madrid, left Chelsea
in 2007 after guiding the Blues to two Premier League titles.
The  Daily Mirror  reported on Feb. 29 that he may return when it
reported he was spotted on a “secret  London  house-hunting
mission” in west London.  Three days ago, the  Daily Mail , another U.K. tabloid, said
Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich might offer Mourinho a salary of
9 million pounds ($14 million) to lure him back.  Interim coach Roberto di Matteo led Chelsea since Andre Villas-Boas was fired on March 5. Chelsea beat Barcelona two
days ago to reach the May 19 Champions League final, which will
be played at Bayern’s Allianz Arena.  To contact the reporter on this story:
