The Bovespa stock index declined as
 Itau Unibanco SA (ITUB)  led Brazilian banks lower after it said it
expects losses from bad loans to rise in the second quarter.  Itau, Latin America’s biggest bank by market value, was the
worst performer on the MSCI Brazil/Financials Index, which fell
the most among 10 industry groups.  OGX Petroleo (OGXP3)  & Gas
Participacoes SA gained the most in four months after it said an
oil field off the coast of Rio de Janeiro was declared
commercially viable.  The Bovespa dropped 0.4 percent to 61,750.38 at the close
in Sao Paulo. The real weakened 0.1 percent to 1.8800 per  U.S.
dollar  at 5:32 p.m. local time.  Itau expects to spend as much as 6.4 billion reais in bad-
loan provisions in the second quarter, up from 6 billion reais
in the first three months of 2012, according to a regulatory
filing today.  Banco Bradesco SA (BBDC4) ’s delinquency rate may rise 10
basis points in the second quarter, executive director Luiz Carlos Angelotti said in a conference call yesterday.  “These alerts from banks regarding expectations of rising
delinquency rates really scared investors,” Pedro Paulo Silveira, chief economist at TOV Corretora, said by telephone
from Sao Paulo. “Considering  interest rates  are decreasing and
the economy is slowing down, banks may see their revenue fall as
well.”  Economic Growth  Brazil’s gross domestic product is expected to grow 3.21
percent this year, according to a weekly central bank survey
released April 23, down from a 3.30 percent projection March 16.
Policy makers lowered the benchmark lending rate last week by 75
basis points to 9 percent, near the record low of 8.75 percent.  Itau fell 5.9 percent to 29.60 reais. Bradesco dropped 2.6
percent to 29.85 reais. The MSCI Brazil/Financials Index
declined 3.2 percent.  OGX advanced 6.3 percent to 13.83 reais. The  oil company 
controlled by billionaire  Eike Batista  said its Waikiki field
has 285 million barrels of estimated recoverable oil reserves.  Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s largest pulp producer, fell
5.3 percent to 15.15 reais after selling 91.2 million shares for
15.83 reais each, a 1.1 percent discount from yesterday’s
closing price.  Banco BTG Pactual SA (BBTG11)  is raising as much as 3.66
billion reais in the biggest initial public offering for an
investment bank in two years, according to a regulatory filing
yesterday.  Bovespa Year-to-Date  Brazil’s benchmark equity  measure  has gained 8.8 percent in
2012, buoyed by local interest-rate cuts, signs of expansion in
the U.S. and speculation Europe may be closer to resolving its
sovereign-debt crisis. The gauge has fallen 9.7 percent since
this year’s high on March 13 as signs of a slowdown in  China 
spurred speculation that demand for commodities exports may
falter.  The Bovespa trades at 10.4 times analysts’ earnings
estimates, in line with the 10.4 ratio for MSCI Inc.’s measure
of 21 developing nations’ equities, weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Traders  moved  7.7 billion reais in stocks in  Sao Paulo 
today, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That compares with a
daily average of 7.27 billion reais this year through April 19,
according to data from the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
