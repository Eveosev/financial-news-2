The discovery of a case of mad cow
disease in the U.S. may have “a bearish effect” on corn and
soybean meal prices if fears about the illness spread, economist
 Dennis Gartman  wrote in his daily newsletter.  The first U.S. case of the illness, or atypical bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, in six years was found in a dairy cow
in central California, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
yesterday. Corn and soybean meal are primary ingredients in
livestock feed.  “When it comes to mad cow disease psychology and fear
trump science and fact, harsh though that may seem,” Gartman
wrote today. “For now, all we can do is wait to see what
happens, fearing that this may not be a one-off event, but
expecting and hoping that it shall be.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
