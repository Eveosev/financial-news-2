The  Atlanta Falcons  acquired Pro
Bowl cornerback Asante Samuel from the  Philadelphia Eagles  for a
late-round draft pick, according to  ESPN .  As part of the trade, the 31-year-old cornerback agreed to
a three-year, $18.5 million contract with the Falcons, ESPN
reported, citing an unidentified person.  The  National Football League â€™s annual college player draft
starts tomorrow. The round or year of pick that the Eagles
received in exchange for Samuel was not reported.  Reggie Roberts, a spokesman for the Falcons, did not
immediately return a voicemail and e-mail seeking comment.
Eagles spokesman Derek Boyko said in an e-mail that the team had
made no announcements.  A Pro Bowl selection from 2007-2010, Samuel played the last
four seasons in Philadelphia. His exit comes one year after the
Eagles acquired  Nnamdi Asomugha  and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie,
giving the team three Pro Bowl cornerbacks.  Samuel, 31, has 45 interceptions and six forced fumbles in
a nine-year career with the Eagles and New England Patriots. His
three interceptions last year were his fewest since 2005.  -- Editor: Rob Gloster, Jay Beberman  To contact the reporter on this story:
