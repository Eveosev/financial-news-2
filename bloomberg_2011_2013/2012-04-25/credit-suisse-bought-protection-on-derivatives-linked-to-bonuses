Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  purchased
protection on derivatives the bank used to award more than 5,500
employees part of their 2011 bonuses.  The bank bought a credit default swap from a third party to
hedge the $11 billion senior tranche of derivatives against the
potential for future swings in counterparties’ credit spreads,
the Zurich-based company said in its first-quarter report today.
Credit Suisse also has an agreement with the same unidentified
entity that requires the bank to provide funding to it in
“certain circumstances,” it said.  The bank is keeping the so-called first-loss piece of about
$500 million of the transaction, which covers about $12 billion
in notional exposure from derivative counterparty risks. It
awarded about $800 million in structured notes linked to the
derivatives, named Partner Asset Facility 2, to the employees as
part of their deferred compensation, the bank said.  Switzerland ’s second-largest bank said earlier today that
first-quarter net income dropped 96 percent to 44 million francs
($48 million) from a year earlier, hurt by a 1.55 billion-franc
charge related to the narrowing of credit spreads on its bonds
and 534 million francs in costs to account for the PAF2 bonuses.  PAF2 was hatched as a sequel to the original Partner Asset
Facility, an investment fund set up for staff in 2008 during the
depths of the U.S. financial crisis, where employees got shares
in a $5.05 billion pool of junk-grade loans and bonds backed by
 commercial mortgages .  To contact the reporter on this story:
