AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  and the  Medicines
Co. (MDCO)  agreed to collaborate on drugs for acute ischemic  heart
disease , the companies said.  The Medicines Co.’s sales force will begin supporting
London-based AstraZeneca’s Brilinta in the U.S. next month, the
companies said today in a statement. AstraZeneca will pay
Parsippany, New Jersey-based Medicines Co. $15 million a year
during the four-year deal with as much as $5 million a year more
if performance thresholds are met, the companies said.  AstraZeneca, the U.K.’s second-biggest drugmaker, acquired
Ardea Biosciences for $1.26 billion on April 23, its biggest
acquisition in five years. AstraZeneca’s head of business
development, Shaun Grady, said then that the pharmaceuticals
maker was in talks with several companies about licensing deals
and acquisitions. The company is interested in late-stage assets
outside its traditional focus on cancer, diabetes, and
gastrointestinal ailments, Grady said.  Medicines Co. rose 7.2 percent to $21.52 at 4:04 p.m. in
 New York , the most since October 3. The company gained 32
percent in the past 12 months.  AstraZeneca and the Medicine Co. also agreed to create
development plans Brilinta and Angiomax, the Medicine Co.’s
anticoagulant, for injection and Medicine Co.’s experimental
drug cangrelor.  To contact the reporters on this story:
