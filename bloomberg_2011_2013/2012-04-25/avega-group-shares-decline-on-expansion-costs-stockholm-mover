Avega Group AB (AVEGB) , a Swedish
information technology consulting company, fell the most in
almost two years in  Stockholm  trading after expansion costs hurt
first-quarter net income.  The shares fell 14 percent to 27.60 kronor at 11:11 a.m. in
the Swedish capital, where Avega is based, for the biggest
intraday drop since May 2010. The stock was the biggest decliner
on the Stockholm All Share index.  First-quarter staff costs rose 19 percent from a year
earlier to 87.4 million kronor ($13 million), while sales
climbed 9.6 percent to 106.4 million kronor, Avega said today in
a statement. Demand was “somewhat subdued” in the quarter,
with a rebound toward the end, the company said. Avega last year
added business for Oracle Corp. applications and system
integration and increased its focus on the Gothenburg area.  “Our main focus now is creating growth and profitability
in the new units and a majority are well on their way,” Chief
Executive Officer Jan Rosenholm said in the statement. “The
focus we have placed on the business in western  Sweden  will
hopefully result in a positive operating profit there before the
end of this year.”  Net income declined to 5.7 million kronor from 8.4 million
kronor a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
