News Corp. (NWSA)  turned over evidence of
“suspected illegality” to the U.S. Department of Justice as
well as London police, company Chairman Rupert Murdoch said.  The information has led to the arrests of “a number of
employees” at the company’s News International unit, Murdoch
said in a witness statement to the Leveson inquiry that was
triggered by the phone-hacking scandal at the company’s now-
defunct News of the World tabloid.  Alisa Finelli, a Justice Department spokeswoman, declined
to comment on the investigation. Brendan Sullivan of Williams &
Connolly LLP in Washington, who was hired by News Corp. in July,
said in an e-mail he has a “long-standing practice of not
commenting on client matters.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
