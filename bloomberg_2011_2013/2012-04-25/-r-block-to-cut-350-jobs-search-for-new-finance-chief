H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the biggest U.S.
tax preparer, plans to cut 350 jobs and close about 200 company-
owned offices as part of a realignment.  Also, H&R Block said it is searching for a new chief
financial officer and that CFO Jeff Brown will remain with the
company during the search process.  Once a successor is
found, Brown will transition to chief accounting and risk
officer, the Kansas City, Missouri-based company said in a
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
