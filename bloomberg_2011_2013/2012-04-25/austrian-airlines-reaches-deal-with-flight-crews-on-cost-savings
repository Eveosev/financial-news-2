Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA) ’s Austrian
Airlines unit has reached an agreement with labor
representatives over reducing flight crew costs, avoiding the
need to transfer 2,100 staff to cheaper contracts at a lower-
cost subsidiary.  The agreement, if approved by the 600 pilots and 1,500
cabin crew, would preclude moving the employees to contracts at
regional operator Tyrolean Airways, Austrian Airlines
spokeswoman Patricia Strampfer said by telephone.  Austrian had said last week that it would implement the
“Plan B” of forcing staff to accept contracts at Tyrolean in
order to deliver a 220 million-euro ($289 million) cost-savings
program after talks failed to make progress.  “We have to reduce our personnel costs, which due to a
number of mechanisms increase by 10 percent each year,”
Strampfer said. “Now this new collective agreement has been
agreed, we don’t need the Plan B.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
