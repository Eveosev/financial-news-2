CEZ AS (CEZ) , the Czech Republic’s
largest power producer, is in advanced talks to buy wind power
projects in Germany, Poland and Romania, Mediafax  reported
today , citing a manager at the company’s Romanian unit.  The Czech company is also holding talks to purchase micro
hydropower plants that aren’t as advanced as the wind-project
acquisition discussions, the Bucharest-based news service quoted

saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
