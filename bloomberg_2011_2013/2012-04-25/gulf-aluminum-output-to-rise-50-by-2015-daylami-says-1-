Aluminum output at the member
nations of the Gulf Cooperation Council will climb to 5.21
million metric tons in 2015 from 3.48 million tons last year,
said Mahmood Daylami, Gulf Aluminum Council secretary general.  Output at the  United Arab Emirates  will continue to account
for half of the total production in the region, climbing to 2.6
million tons from 1.75 million tons last year, he said in a
speech at a Metal Bulletin conference in Shanghai.  “The challenge of the expansion in the region will be the
availability of gas and the raw material supply - alumina,” he
said. “The industry will remain export-oriented to meet the
demand of declining output elsewhere in the world.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
