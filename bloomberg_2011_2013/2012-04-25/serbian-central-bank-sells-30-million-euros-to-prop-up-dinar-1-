The Serbian central bank sold euros
to support the dinar, as it tries to curb its declines 10 days
ahead of May 6 general elections.  The Belgrade-based Narodna Banka Srbije said it sold 30
million euros ($39.5 million) to “enable the smooth
functioning” of the market. The National Bank of Serbia has
sold 638.5 million euros since the start of 2012 to prop up the
dinar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
