Investment Technology Group Inc. (ITG) , a
brokerage and financial technology firm, will offer tools to
measure the cost of trading in the foreign-exchange market as
fund managers seek to manage their expenses.  ITG’s transaction-cost-analysis product will use data from
10 providers and complements the firm’s tool for studying
equities, the New York-based company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  “Foreign exchange is the largest and most liquid
securities trading market, but it is also among the least
transparent and most challenging to trade in,” Ian Domowitz,
head of ITG analytics, said in the statement. The new service
seeks to “measure performance, improve execution processes and
quality and fulfill compliance requirements.”  Transaction-cost analysis, which allows funds to measure
trading performance and gauge whether they are getting best
execution, is expanding beyond equities as banks seek to cut
costs following the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression. ITG’s product will compete with Abel Noser Corp.,
which on April 17 said it’s starting a similar service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
