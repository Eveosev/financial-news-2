German corn planting may exceed all
estimates as farmers favor the crop to replace winter grains and
rapeseed that were plowed under after frost damage, industry
group Deutsches Maiskomitee e.V. said.  Corn may be planted for use as  animal feed  and to produce
biogas, Bonn-based DMK wrote in a  report  on its website today.  Some regions where winter kill was concentrated may have
insufficient drying capacity to handle increased corn
production, which could weigh on local prices, the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
