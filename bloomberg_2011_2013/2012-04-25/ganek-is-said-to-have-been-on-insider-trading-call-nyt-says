Level Global Investors LP founder
David Ganek participated in a 2008 employee telephone
conversation about confidential information concerning  Dell
Inc. (DELL) ’s earnings announcements, the New York Times reported,
citing an unidentified source.  Ganek was on the call with Level Global co-founder Anthony Chiasson and two of the hedge fund’s analysts, according to the
New York Times. Details of the call are explained in
prosecutor’s January complaint which referred to Ganek as
“Individual 4,” the Times reported, citing a person briefed on
the case.  Ganek’s alleged participation in the call was first 
reported by the Financial Times, which also cited unidentified 
sources. The New York Times reported that Ganek hasn’t
been accused of wrongdoing, and that there is no indication he
knew the information about Dell was illegal. The government’s
case claims Level Global made more than $50 million from the
 insider trading , according to the Times.  John Carroll , Ganek’s lawyer, didn’t immediately return a
voice mail from Bloomberg News left after regular business hours
seeking comment.  Ellen Davis , a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney
Preet Bharara in Manhattan, declined to comment.  Davidson Goldin, a spokesman for Level Global, declined to
comment.  Assistant U.S. Attorney Antonia Apps told U.S. District
Judge Richard Sullivan at an April 13 conference that the U.S.
didn’t intend to file any new indictment in Chiasson’s case or
add any new defendants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
