Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the oil-sands
company spun off by  Encana Corp. (ECA)  in 2009, said first-quarter
profit increased as output and prices rose.  Net income climbed to C$426 million ($432 million), or 56
cents a share, from C$47 million, or 6 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said in a statement on  Business Wire 
today. Adjusted per-share profit was less than the 54-cent
average of 18  analystsâ€™ estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Producers have benefited from an increase in the price of
crude, which traded at an average $103.03 a barrel in New York
during the first three months of the year, 8.9 percent more than
a year earlier. Cenovus pumped 156,850 barrels of oil and
natural-gas liquids a day in the period, up from 137,355 barrels
a year earlier.  The company said in December it plans to boost investment
23 percent to as much as C$3.4 billion this year to help
increase output. Production at its Christina Lake oil-sands
operation is forecast to more than double in 2012, according to
the Dec. 7 statement.  Cenovus fell 0.2 percent to C$34.13 in Toronto yesterday.
