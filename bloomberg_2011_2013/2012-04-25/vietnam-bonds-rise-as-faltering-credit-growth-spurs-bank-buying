Vietnam ’s benchmark five-year bonds
rose for an eighth day, the longest run of gains since June 2010,
on speculation banks are buying more government debt as credit
growth falters. The dong weakened.  Commercial bank lending in Vietnam fell 1 percent in the
first quarter, according to an April 11 government statement.
Lenders should consider extending debt repayment periods for
borrowers who may miss deadlines but will be able to repay the
debt later, the State Bank of Vietnam said in a statement on its
website late yesterday.  “Credit growth is not strong, that’s why most of the banks
want to invest in bonds and keep their money safe,” said Nguyen Duy Phong, a Ho Chi Minh City-based analyst at Viet Capital
Securities Co.  Five-year bond  yields  fell three basis points or 0.03
percentage point, to 10.82 percent, according to a daily fixing
rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the lowest level
since November 2010.  The dong traded 0.4 percent weaker at 20,853 per dollar as
of 3:54 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The currency
is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
