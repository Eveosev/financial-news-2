Gruma SAB (GRUMAB) , the world’s largest
maker of corn and wheat tortillas, posted its smallest profit in
seven quarters after derivative losses.  First-quarter net income fell 98 percent to 83.9 million
pesos ($6.4 million) from the year-earlier period, when Gruma
profited from selling a stake in Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB.
Profit missed the estimate of 278 million pesos from analyst
Fernando Olvera of BBVA Bancomer SA in Mexico City. Sales were
5.4 billion pesos.  Gruma said that natural gas hedging losses boosted sales
expenses by 17 million pesos. Financing costs rose by 207
million pesos because of a writedown from a “mark-to-market
currency valuation” on hedging contracts linked to corn
purchases.  Gruma reported losses of 13.4 billion pesos from the third
quarter of 2008 through the first quarter of 2009 because of
wrong-way currency derivative bets, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The tortilla maker avoided bankruptcy by
refinancing debt and getting new loans in 2009.  Gruma rose 4.7 percent to 38.94 pesos on the Mexican Stock
Exchange in trading prior to the report. The shares have gained
68 percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
