Bank of America Corp. , the second-
largest U.S. bank, offered to buy back $1.75 billion of trust-
preferred securities and subordinated notes to cut debt.  The offers expire midnight in New York on May 22, unless
extended, the Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank said today in
a pair of statements. The company, which announced plans last
year to retire debt, said it reserves the right to repurchase
more securities.  Chief Executive Officer Brian T. Moynihan, 52, is reducing
his firm’s long-term debt while raising capital to meet demands
from regulators for a larger cushion against losses. Trust-
preferred securities won’t count as Tier 1 common equity under
coming rules set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.  “It’s part of the continuing effort we have to strengthen
our balance sheet and improve the quality of our capital,” said
Jerry Dubrowski, a Bank of America spokesman.  Bank of America retired $4.2 billion of debt for cash and
exchanged $730 million of trust-preferred securities for cash
and shares in the first quarter, the firm said this month. Those
actions helped improve Tier 1 common equity by $1.7 billion in
the quarter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
