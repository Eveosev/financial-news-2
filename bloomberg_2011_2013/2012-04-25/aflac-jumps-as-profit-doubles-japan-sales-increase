Aflac Inc. (AFL) , the world’s biggest
seller of supplemental health insurance, gained the most in six
months after first-quarter profit doubled as  Japan  sales
increased.  Aflac rose 7.8 percent to close at $45.26 in New York, the
most since Oct. 27. The Columbus, Georgia-based insurer, which
has gained 4.6 percent this year, forecast a 10 percent sales
gain in Japan in 2012 after previously saying the figure may
drop.  Net income jumped to $785 million from $389 million a year
earlier as investment losses narrowed, Aflac said in a statement
yesterday after the close of regular trading. New annualized
premium sales in Japan, where the company gets about three-
quarters of its revenue, climbed 54 percent, led by deals
through banks. Aflac also introduced an upgraded medical policy
that’s seen “positive” response among Japanese consumers.  “Sales in Japan were phenomenally strong,” analysts
including Edward Shields at Sandler O’Neill & Partners LP wrote
in an April 24 research note. “Sales trends will continue to be
strong.”  Realized investment losses were $29 million, compared with
$376 million a year earlier, as Aflac reduced risk tied to
European financial companies. Book value, a measure of assets
minus liabilities, rose to $29.19 a share as of March 31 from
$27.76 on Dec. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
