Morgan Stanley’s (MS)  Hidetoshi Ohashi,
a Tokyo-based credit strategist and the head of fixed-income
research, will leave the bank, according to Mika Watanabe, a
bank spokeswoman.  Ohashi, 43, plans to leave at the end of June to start a
hedge fund based in Singapore with a focus on Japanese corporate
bonds and credit-default swaps, a person familiar with the
matter said, asking not to be identified because the details are
private.  Takehiro Sato, the investment bank’s chief economist for
Japan, will take on Ohashi’s responsibilities as the head of
fixed-income research and continue in his current role,
Watanabe, a Tokyo-based spokeswoman at Morgan Stanley MUFG
Securities Co. said when contacted by telephone today. The
company is a  Japan  unit of New York-based Morgan Stanley.  Ohashi joined Morgan Stanley in September 2000 after
leaving Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan’s biggest life insurer,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
