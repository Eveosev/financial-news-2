Boeing Co. (BA)  climbed the most in
eight months after the world’s largest aerospace company posted
a first-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates and raised
its 2012 forecast.  Net income rose 58 percent to $923 million, or $1.22 a
share, buoyed by increased deliveries of commercial jets, Boeing
said today in a statement. The shares  jumped  5.3 percent to
$77.08 at the close in New York, leading the advance in the  Dow
Jones Industrial Average .  Quarterly shipments of 137 jetliners topped Airbus SAS’s
131 as Chicago-based Boeing bids to retake the global
commercial-sales title it lost in 2003. Boeing is boosting
production by more than 60 percent in the four years through
2014 to pare a record order backlog.  “The results look terrific, led by the commercial aircraft
side of the company,” Rick Whittington, a Drexel Hamilton LLC
analyst in  New York , said in a telephone interview. “Boeing has
this monstrous commercial backlog and the question has been if
they can get them out the door profitably, and while the jury
still isn’t completely in there, the signs are looking
positive.”  The first-quarter profit exceeded the 93-cent average
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 26 analysts. Sales rose 30
percent to $19.4 billion, beating the average estimate of $18.3
billion among 22 analysts.  Profit Forecast  Full-year profit will be $4.15 to $4.35 a share, after a
litigation-related reserve was reduced, up from the $4.05 to
$4.25 projected in January.  Shrinking that reserve contributed 11 cents a share to
Boeing’s earnings, according to the statement. Even without that
benefit, profit still would have been “well above consensus”
estimates,  Douglas Harned , a Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. analyst
in New York, said in a note.  Boeing reiterated its plan to deliver from 70 to 85 wide-
body 787 and 747 jets this year, with the composite-plastic
Dreamliner accounting for “approximately half” of the total.
The company handed over five 787s in the first quarter.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  took delivery today of a 747-8
Intercontinental, the latest passenger version of the four-
engine jumbo jet. The German carrier is the first airline to get
the new plane, after Boeing handed one over to an unidentified
private customer on Feb. 28.  Segment Revenue  Revenue at the commercial airplane unit climbed 54 percent
to $10.9 billion last quarter, while profit more than doubled to
$1.08 billion. Boeing’s defense, space and security division
increased profit by 11 percent to $742 million on $8.2 billion
of sales.  The results marked a “very good start to 2012 by Boeing,
with better-than-expected operating performance in both
divisions,” Robert Stallard, an RBC Capital Markets analyst in
New York, wrote in a note to clients.  “If Boeing can continue to execute, then we think there is
the potential” for further increases in the full-year forecast,
wrote Stallard, who rates the shares as outperform. Harned has a
market perform rating on the stock, while Drexel Hamilton’s
Whittington recommends Boeing as a buy.  Boeing’s commercial backlog rose 4.1 percent to $305.3
billion as of March 31 from the end of 2011.  Demand for new jetliners is “strong,” as passenger air
traffic “remains resilient,” Chief Executive Officer Jim McNerney said on a conference call.  To contact the reporter on this story:
