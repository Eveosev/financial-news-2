Encana Corp. (ECA)  Chief Executive
Officer Randall Eresman ruled out a sale of the Canadian oil and
natural-gas producer as the company markets assets to compensate
for slumping  gas prices .  Earlier this month, Petroliam Nasional Bhd., the Malaysian
state-owned  oil company , said it was studying a Canadian
acquisition for more than $5 billion, spurring speculation that
Calgary-based Encana may be a target. A sale isn’t an option,
Eresman said during a conference call today.  Gas prices in  North America , where production has soared
amid a boom in hydraulic fracturing, fell to their lowest
quarterly average in 10 years during the period. The fuel sold
at an average of $2.50 a million British thermal units, down
from an average of $4.20 a year earlier and a high of $13.577 in
2008. Encana is Canada’s largest natural-gas producer by volume.  “We would need a dollar higher to achieve our cost of
capital,” Eresman said. Encana plans to have $3 billion in cash
on its balance sheet by the end of the year, helped by joint
ventures and assets sales, he said.  Encana today said first-quarter net income was $12 million,
compared with a net loss of $361 million a year earlier.
Commodity-price hedging contributed $358 million in realized
after-tax gains, helping counter a decline in gas prices.  The gas producer agreed to sell a 40 percent stake in its
Cutbank Ridge operation for C$1.45 billion ($1.47 billion) to
 Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  in February.  Shares rose 4 percent to C$18.36 at the close in Toronto,
the  most  in more than two months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
