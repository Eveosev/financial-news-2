TAG Immobilien AG (TEG) , the German
company buying a Bayerische Landesbank real-estate unit, said
full-year profit more than tripled on rising rental income and
lower borrowing costs.  Net income climbed to 66.9 million euros ($87 million), or
1.05 euros a share, from 18.5 million euros, or 48 cents, a year
earlier, the Hamburg-based company said in a statement today.
Analysts expected earnings of 72 cents a share, the average of
six estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Rental income rose to 115 million euros from 52 million
euros after several acquisitions last year doubled the value of
TAG’s real-estate holdings. TAG last month agreed to pay 160
million euros for Bayerische Landesbank’s DKB Immobilien unit,
adding 25,000 homes.  “It will be more difficult to buy more,” TAG Chief
Executive Officer Rolf Elgeti said on a conference call today.
“Prices are rising and the environment is becoming more
competitive” with a growing number of bidders making it more
difficult for TAG to win property auctions, he said.  The commercial real-estate market isn’t attractive, Elgeti
said. “We will focus our investments on the residential side,
and if anything, we would sell commercial assets,” he said.  A drop in funding costs also helped boost 2011 earnings.
Average interest charges for its  mortgage loans  fell to 3.9
percent from 4.5 percent over the course of the year, the
company said.  Chief Financial Officer Hans-Ulrich Sutter resigned and
will be replaced by Georg Griesemann, a TAG accounting and tax
executive, the company said in a separate statement.  TAG rose 2.4 cents to 7.09 euros as of 11:59 a.m. in
Frankfurt trading. The shares have risen about 2.2 percent in
the past 12 months, while the 564-member CDAX Performance Index
has dropped 8.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
