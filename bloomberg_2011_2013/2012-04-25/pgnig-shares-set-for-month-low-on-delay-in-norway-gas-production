Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA , Polandâ€™s biggest gas company, headed for the
lowest in almost a month after saying gas production from its
Skarv field off  Norway  has been delayed.  The stock declined 1.2 percent to 4.01 zloty by 9:29 a.m.
in Warsaw, set for the lowest closing level since March 29.  Production was postponed to the fourth quarter from the
second quarter as winter weather prevented the installation of
riser pipes, the company said in a statement yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
