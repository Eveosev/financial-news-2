Vestjysk Bank A/S (VJBA)  and Aarhus
Lokalbank A/S won temporary European Union approval for rescue
aid from the Danish government.  The European Commission authorized the aid to the banks,
which agreed to merge in January, to address funding challenges
and help them meet new  capital requirements . Denmark must submit
a restructuring plan within six months for the EU to grant final
approval for the financial help, regulators said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Vestjysk Bank, based in Lemvig, Denmark, will convert
state-held hybrid capital of about 297 million kroner ($52
million), giving the state a majority holding, it said in
January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
