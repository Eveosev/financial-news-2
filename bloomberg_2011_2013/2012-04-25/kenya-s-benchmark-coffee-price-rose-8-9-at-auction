Kenya ’s benchmark coffee price rose
8.9 percent to $305.44 a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag at a weekly
auction yesterday in Nairobi, the capital.  The average price for all coffee sold dropped 2 percent to
$199.13 a bag as supplies increased, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange
said in an e-mailed statement today.  The benchmark AA grade sold for as much as $415 a bag
compared with $322 a bag last week, while supplies declined 15
percent to 2,189 bags, it said.  “Prices didn’t show marked changes for some grades as
conditions at global markets remain unchanged,” Mansukh Shah, a
coffee trader with the Nairobi-based Alanwood Ltd., said by
phone. “The quality remained good like last week.”  Sales at the auction rose 42 percent to 7,562 bags worth
$1.83 million from 5,317 bags valued at $1.32 million last week,
the exchange said. Supplies of all beans dropped 5.6 percent to
20,655 bags, according to the data.  The following are details of yesterday’s auction in dollars
for a 50-kilogram bag:  To contact the reporter on this story:
