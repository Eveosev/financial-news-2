Tokyo Electric Power Co. (9501)  said
thousands of gallons of highly radioactive water has leaked from
an underground pool at the crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear
plant and may have seeped into the soil.  Tepco estimates about 120 tons (32,280 gallons) of
radioactive water has escaped, company spokesman Daisuke Hirose
said, adding it was uncertain how much contaminated water has
soaked into the soil. While he said the utility plans to
complete pumping the remaining water to other underground pools
by April 9,  Japan ’s  Nuclear Regulation Authority  today said “a
small quantity” of radioactive water may be leaking from
another tank.  The leak is the latest stumble in efforts to stabilize the
plant after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami that caused
the worst nuclear crisis in 25 years. Tepco continues to inject
water into the damaged reactors to cool them, and the leaked
water contains about 710 billion becquerels of radiation, the
most since the facility reached a stable state known as cold
shutdown in December 2011, Hirose said.  Any leakage is unlikely to have reached the ocean as the
underground pool is about 800 meters (0.5 mile) away from the
tank, Hirose said, adding that Tepco is investigating the cause
of the leakage.  A cooling system for one of the spent fuel pools
temporarily stopped on April 5, and the plant lost power on
March 18 after a rat caused an electrical short-circuit, the
company said.  About 276,000 tons of highly radioactive water is stored in
tanks at the Fukushima Dai-Ichi plant, according to Tepco’s
latest  data . That’s enough to fill about 110 Olympic-sized
swimming pools, according to Bloomberg News calculations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
