U.S. Secretary of State  John Kerry , saying differences between Palestinians and Israelis can be overcome, declined to set deadlines or offer details on what he called a “quiet strategy” for resuscitating peace talks.  “This process should not be rushed,” he told reporters yesterday in Jerusalem. “It would be irresponsible not to explore thoroughly the possibilities for moving forward.”  Kerry has shown interest in revisiting a dormant proposal, endorsed by the  Arab League  a decade ago, in which Arab states would normalize relations with  Israel  if it withdraws from lands occupied during the 1967 Mideast war, according to two U.S. officials and a Turkish diplomat who asked not to be named because talks are intended to remain private.  “I am having discussions about those steps that would get at this issue of mistrust, those steps that would allow us to get a process,” Kerry said, declining to elaborate on specific areas of discussion. “There is a quiet strategy that I intend to keep quiet.”  The top U.S. diplomat is on his third trip to the region in a month. Kerry met privately yesterday with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Salam Fayyad and Israeli President  Shimon Peres  before a scheduled dinner with Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu .  After arriving April 7, Kerry went straight to the West Bank for a one-hour meeting alone with Palestinian Authority President  Mahmoud Abbas  in Ramallah.  While mistrust between the parties is high, Kerry said he is “convinced that we can break that down, but I am not going to do it under guidelines and under time limits.”  Reviving Negotiations  President  Barack Obama , who visited Israel last month, has charged Kerry with reviving talks between the Palestinians and Israel. The last round of negotiations fell apart in September 2010 after Netanyahu didn’t extend a 10-month freeze on settlement building in areas of the  West Bank  claimed by Palestinians.  Last week, Abbas said he wouldn’t pursue action against Israel in international bodies, including United Nations agencies, if Kerry got Israel to agree to a two-month moratorium on settlement construction.  Kerry, who has been to the region on all three of his trips overseas since becoming secretary in late January, is seeking to create a positive climate for resumption of negotiations with Israel while keeping details of any possible initiative a secret, according to a U.S. official who asked not to be named discussing diplomatic matters.  ‘Judicious Approach’  “It’s a bit premature to get excited,” said  Robert Danin , a senior fellow for Middle East and Africa studies at the  Council on Foreign Relations  in  Washington . “Clearly, there is a signal of intent to move forward. Kerry is not just freelancing, and the administration is pursuing a more judicious approach.”  The arrival of leaders from Jordan, Turkey and Qatar in Washington in coming weeks, along with Kerry’s shuttle diplomacy, have raised expectations a new peace plan is in the works.  One obstacle is the growing political clout of Hamas, the rival Palestinian movement that controls the  Gaza Strip  and is considered a terrorist organization by Israel, the U.S. and the European Union.  “The balance of power in Palestinian politics has shifted,” Danin said in a telephone interview. “Hamas has been emboldened by the rise of the Muslim Brotherhood across the region and the 2011 cease-fire with Israel. There is a sense that Hamas is on the ascendancy.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Flavia Krause-Jackson in  Jerusalem  at  fjackson@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: John Walcott at  jwalcott9@bloomberg.net
