Ronan O’Gara kicked all the points
for two-time champion Munster in an 18-12 win over Harlequins in
the quarterfinals of European rugby’s Heineken Cup today. Toulon
also reached the last four.  Harlequins led 9-6 at halftime with three penalties from
 Nick Evans  but couldn’t withstand a comeback by the visitors in
the second half. In France, Jonny Wilkinson kicked all the
points for Toulon in a 21-15 win over two-time champion
Leicester, for whom  Toby Flood  kicked five penalties.  Yesterday, Saracens beat Ulster 27-16 and Clermont Auvergne
defeated Montpellier 36-14 in the other quarterfinals.  Saracens will play Toulon in the semifinals, with Munster
meeting Clermont Auvergne. The games will be played on the last
weekend in April, with the final of European rugby’s top club
competition scheduled for May 18 in Dublin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
