Kuwaiti shares gained, sending the
benchmark index to the highest level since January 2011 amid
optimism the government will revive a $110 billion investment
plan to boost economic growth in the OPEC member.  The Kuwait SE  Price Index  rose for a sixth day, climbing
0.5 percent to 6,851.17 at the close.  Kuwait Real Estate Co. (KRE) 
climbed to the highest level in a month.  Agility (AGLTY)  advanced 1.7
percent after winning a $190 million UN contract in Sudan’s
Darfur region. The Bloomberg GCC 200 Index, which tracks the
biggest 200 companies in the Gulf Cooperation Council, fell 0.1
percent.  About 673 million shares were traded in Kuwait, compared
with a 12-month daily average of about 608 million shares,
according to  data compiled by Bloomberg . Kuwait’s government and
parliament this year pledged to fast-track the development plan
first approved in February 2010.  “People are optimistic and believe the government will do
something with the development plan,” Fouad Darwish, head of
brokerage at Kuwait-based  Global Investment House KSCC (GLOBAL) , said by
phone. “The optimism is so strong that people even ignored the
fact that many companies didn’t announce their results on time,
which usually led to selling off.”  ‘Trickle Down’  Kuwait’s parliament passed a law requiring the government
to pay 744 million dinars ($2.6 billion) to purchase citizens’
loans taken before March 30, 2008 and write off all interest
before rescheduling payments. The law also requires banks to
repay borrowers who were charged more than 4 percentage points
above the  base rate  on their loans.  The law may have also helped spur gains in the stock
market, according to  Julian Bruce , head of institutional trading
at EFG-Hermes Holding SAE in Dubai. “It’s positive for banks
non-performing loans and also means some trickle down of
additional cash being recycled into the market.”  The index has gained 15 percent this year. Agility rose to
610 fils while Kuwait Real Estate surged 3.3 percent to 62 fils,
the highest since March 6.  Elsewhere in the GCC, Dubai’s  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  fell 0.3
percent,  Abu Dhabi ’s measure declined 0.1 percent and Qatar’s
gauge lost 0.5 percent. Oman’s MSM30 Index advanced 0.4 percent,
Bahrain’s measure rose 0.2 percent and Saudi Arabia’s Tadawul
All Share Index fell less than 0.1 percent.  Egypt’s EGX 30 Index rose 1 percent. EFG-Hermes Holding SAE
jumped 3.3 percent to 9.71 Egyptian pounds. The country’s
biggest investment bank said its joint-venture with Qatar’s
QInvest LLC may be at risk if it doesn’t receive Egyptian
regulatory approval in the coming days.  Israel’s TA-25 index declined 0.3 percent. The yield on the
4.25 percent notes due March 2023 fell five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 3.81 percent, the lowest since the
notes started trading in August, at the close in Tel Aviv.  To contact the reporters on this story:
