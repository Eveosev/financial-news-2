ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest inter-
bank broker, said a proposed financial transaction tax in the
European Union would hurt the region’s economies.  The rules would raise funding costs for governments and
companies, prompt financial activity to move outside of the tax
zone and increase systemic risk, ICAP said in a  report  today.  “The proposed FTT is a misguided policy which would be
severely detrimental to both EU economies and businesses,”
 Michael Spencer , ICAP’s chief executive officer, said in a
 statement  today. “It would severely damage the functioning of
debt markets which are essential for governments and companies
to raise finance. It would increase both their borrowing and
operational costs and lead to a flood of financial activity
being moved outside the FTT zone.”  The tax may increase the annual interest cost as much as
8.5 billion euros ($11 billion) for Germany, Italy and France in
the first year of implementation, ICAP said, citing an estimate
from Bank of America Corp.  The U.K., which doesn’t seek to adopt the plan, will
probably be among the biggest generators of revenue and won’t
benefit from the tax, ICAP said.  Eleven countries have provisionally agreed to the tax:
 Austria ,  Belgium , Estonia, France, Germany, Greece, Portugal,
Spain, Italy, Slovakia and Slovenia, ICAP said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
