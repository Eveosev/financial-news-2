High winds and rainfall generated by
two low-pressure systems disrupted train and flight operations
over wide areas of  Japan  for a second day, with further storms
forecast.  Some flights departing from Sapporo in northern Japan were
canceled, All Nippon Airways Co.  said  on its website. Operations
on parts of eight rail lines on Japanâ€™s north main island were
canceled or delayed, Hokkaido Railway Co.  said .  Northern and eastern Japan will experience strong winds
through April 8 with some areas receiving heavy rain, the  Japan
Meteorological Agency   said  today on its website. One low-
pressure system in the Japan Sea and another in the Tokyo region
will merge near Hokkaido by tomorrow morning, the agency said.  Winds as strong as 126 kilometers (78 miles) per hour may
hit northern Japan with some areas in Hokkaido seeing up to 50
millimeters (2 inches) of rain per hour, according to the
weather agency. Waves as high as 8 meters are expected along
northern coasts, the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
