Grupo Modelo SAB (GMODELOC) ,  Mexico ’s largest
brewer, said the government is investigating the cause of an
accident at its Mexico City plant that killed seven workers.  The deaths occurred yesterday in “a confined area of a
tank in which cleaning and maintenance work was being done,”
Jennifer Shelley, a Modelo spokeswoman, said in a statement. In
a telephone interview today, she declined to elaborate, saying
Mexican authorities were leading the inquiry.  Officials from the Labor Ministry, federal district
attorney’s office and the federal civil protection agency are
investigating the accident along with representatives from
Mexico City, Shelley said. The city’s attorney general’s office
is part of the probe, according to the agency’s press office.  Four of the dead were maintenance contractors and the other
three were Modelo employees who probably went into the tank in a
rescue attempt, the Mexican newspaper Universal reported today.
The newspaper Milenio reported that the deaths were due to
unspecified toxins.  The Modelo brewery, its employees and the surrounding
neighborhood weren’t at any risk, and production isn’t expected
to be affected, Shelley said.  Modelo is the maker of brands including Corona beer and has
agreed to be acquired by  Anheuser-Busch InBev NV. (ABI)  The shares
