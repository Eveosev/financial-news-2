The Canadian government said it is
examining whether the  Royal Bank of Canada  broke immigration
rules by hiring foreign workers to replace domestic employees.  RBC,  Canada ’s largest bank by assets, fired “dozens” of
staff in its investors services group and replaced them with
individuals under contract with  iGATE Corp ., the CBC television
network  reported  on its website. One of the employees being
replaced told the network the new workers were from  India .  “If true, this situation is unacceptable,” Human
Resources Minister Diane Finley said in an e-mailed statement.  Spokesmen for Toronto-based RBC and Fremont, California-
based iGate didn’t immediately respond to e-mailed requests for
comment sent outside normal business hours.  Canada’s temporary foreign worker  program  isn’t intended to
replace Canadian employees with foreigners, Finley said. “When
there are jobs available, Canadians must always be the first in
line for opportunities from employers who are hiring.”  Finley said her officials are working with immigration
authorities to “determine the next steps.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
