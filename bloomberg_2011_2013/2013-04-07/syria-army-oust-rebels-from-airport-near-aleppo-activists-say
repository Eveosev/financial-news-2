Syrian forces pushed rebels,
including an al-Qaeda linked group, from a village next to the
Aleppo international airport and a military airbase, the Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights said.  Intense fighting is taking place on the outskirts of the
“strategic” Aziza village after Syrian forces ousted rebels
late yesterday after weeks of clashes, the  U.K.-based group  said
on its Facebook page today. Aziza and Jisr Assan were used by
rebels to attack the airports, the group said.  Rebels have tried to capture military airports to reduce
the government’s air superiority. In February, rebels including
the Islamist Al-Nusra Front, a group classified terrorist by the
U.S., captured the Jarah military airport in Aleppo province.
They have been unable to seize the Aleppo airport and the Bab
al-Neyrab military airbase.  The two-year Syrian conflict has killed more than 70,000
people and the United Nations estimates 1 million refugees have
fled to Lebanon, Jordan,  Turkey  and other countries. The
fighting has evolved along largely sectarian lines, with many in
the Sunni majority supporting the rebels while President Bashar al-Assad draws support mainly from his Alawite community.  Syrian rebels claimed to have cut the road linking Damascus
to Jordan, Al Arabiya reported today. Government forces clashed
with rebels in the towns of Hran al-A’wamid and al-A’teiba in
the Damascus suburbs, the Observatory said on its Facebook page.  To contact the reporter on this story:
