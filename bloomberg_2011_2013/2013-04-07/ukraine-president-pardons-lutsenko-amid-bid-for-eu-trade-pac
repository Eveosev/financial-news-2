Ukraine President  Viktor Yanukovych 
pardoned jailed former Interior Minister Yuriy Lutsenko, a move
that may bolster damaged ties with the European Union.  Lutsenko, who was serving a four-year sentence for abuse of
power and is an ally of jailed former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko , was pardoned along with Tymoshenko’s then-
Environment Minister Heorhiy Filipchuk, according to a decree on
the president’s website.  The EU delayed an association and free-trade deal with
Ukraine indefinitely after Tymoshenko was jailed in 2011 in a
case the 27-member bloc deems an example of selective justice.
It has sought changes to Ukraine’s justice and electoral systems
as a condition for the agreement.  Lutsenko and Tymoshenko, who’s serving a seven-year prison
term, were key figures in the Orange Revolution that helped
overturn Yanukovych’s 2004 presidential victory. Tymoshenko was
convicted of abusing her powers as premier in signing a 2009
natural-gas agreement with Russia that Yanukovych says resulted
in his country being overcharged $6 billion a year. She denies
wrongdoing.  The pardons were welcomed by EU Enlargement Commissioner
Stefan Fule, who called it “first but important step” in
dealing with selective justice, in a Twitter posting today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
