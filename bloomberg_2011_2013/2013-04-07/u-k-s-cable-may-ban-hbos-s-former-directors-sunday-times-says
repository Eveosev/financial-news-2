U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
is studying whether three former directors of HBOS Plc can be
banned from serving as company directors after being blamed for
the banking group’s failure, the Sunday Times reported, citing
an interview.  The lender required a 28 billion-pound ($42.9 billion)
rescue and a panel of lawmakers said April 5 regulators should
consider barring former Chairman Dennis Stevenson and ex-Chief
Executive Officers James Crosby and  Andy Hornby  from the finance
industry.  Cable has asked officials to probe the evidence against the
trio as the first part of the process required to strip people
of access to company directorships, the Sunday Times said.  “It’s quite a legalistic process,” Cable told the
newspaper. He said he was “surprised” Hornby and Stevenson
were “still active” in companies.  Almost five years after the rescue, the U.K. lawmakers
report singled out Stevenson, Crosby and Hornby for embarking on
an aggressive expansion strategy, “incompetent” lending and
their failure to understand and manage the risks they were
taking. By focusing on risky commercial real estate, leveraged
loans and funding for entrepreneurs, HBOS ran up bigger loan
losses than any U.K. counterpart, forcing it to be rescued, the
panel said in a report that branded the company as a “manual
for bad banking.”  So far, the only HBOS executive to be banned from the
industry for life is Peter Cummings, who ran the corporate unit
responsible for most of the bank’s losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
