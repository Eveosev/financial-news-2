U.K. Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
said he sees no need for an immediate response to North Korea’s
mounting threats to attack the U.S. and turn inward from the
rest of the world.  “It’s important to keep calm,” Hague said on BBC
television’s “Andrew Marr Show” today. “We shouldn’t respond
and play to that rhetoric and presentation of an external threat
every time they come out.”  Tensions have risen since Kim Jong Un’s regime detonated a
nuclear device in February in defiance of tightened United
Nations sanctions. North Korea asked countries including the
U.K. to consider evacuating their embassies, warning that they
can’t be protected, the Foreign Office in  London  said April 5.  Foreign governments should be “clear and united and
calm,” Hague said, adding that  North Korea  should be told it
faces a “strategic choice” between increased isolation and
better relations with other nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
