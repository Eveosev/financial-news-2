Serbia  sealed a spot in the Davis
Cup tennis semifinals by ousting record 32-time champion the
U.S. as top-ranked Novak Djokovic beat Sam Querrey in four sets.  Serbia will next host  Canada , which advanced to the final
four for the first time after Milos Raonic beat Andreas Seppi
yesterday to secure the home victory against  Italy  in  Vancouver .
 Argentina  will visit defending champion the Czech Republic in
the other semifinal in the top team event in men’s tennis.  Djokovic gave Serbia, which broke through for its first
title in 2010, an unassailable 3-1 lead in its best-of-five tie
against the U.S. with his 7-5, 6-7 (4-7), 6-1, 6-0 victory over
Querrey in Boise,  Idaho . Serbia seized a 2-1 advantage two days
ago when its doubles team of Ilija Bozoljac and Nenad Zimonjic
upset No. 1-ranked brothers Bob and Mike Bryan.  “It wasn’t about my win Friday or today, it was just about
the team win, the team effort,” Djokovic said on the Davis Cup
website. “That’s something that is very special and beautiful
about this competition. You can represent your country and you
get to be a part of a team. You get to feel the team spirit that
carries you on to victory.”  Serbia and Canada had entered yesterday’s reverse singles
2-1 up after both winning their doubles matches 15-13 in the
fifth set.  In Astana, the Czech Republic took an insurmountable 3-1
lead in its quarterfinal against host Kazakhstan as Lukas Rosol
defeated Evgeny Korolev 7-6 (7-5), 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (7-5), 6-2.  Argentina beat France 3-2 in Buenos Aires as 71st-ranked
Carlos Berlocq defeated No. 13 Gilles Simon 6-4, 5-7, 6-4, 6-4
in the decisive singles match. France’s Jo-Wilfried Tsonga had
kept the contest alive with a 6-3, 6-3, 6-0 win against
Argentina’s Juan Monaco in yesterday’s first singles match.  The semifinals are scheduled for Sept. 13-15, with hosts
Serbia and the Czech Republic getting the choice of venue and
surface. The final will be held Nov. 15-17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
