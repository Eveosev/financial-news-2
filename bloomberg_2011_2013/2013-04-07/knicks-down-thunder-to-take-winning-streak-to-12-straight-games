The  New York Knicks  extended their
National Basketball Association winning streak to 12 games with
a 125-120 road victory against the Oklahoma City Thunder.  The only two seasons in which the Knicks had longer winning
streaks, they reached the NBA Finals.  Carmelo Anthony scored 36 points yesterday at Chesapeake
Energy Arena in Oklahoma City as the Knicks (50-26) logged 50
wins for the first time since the 1999-2000 season.  “We knew they were going to make runs, they’ve got their
crowd behind them, but we kept our composure,” Anthony said in
a televised interview. “It was a great team win for us.”  The Knicks won a franchise-record 18 regular-season games
in a row from Oct. 24 through Nov. 11, 1969, the season in which
they secured the first of their two NBA titles. New York won 15
straight games from March 1 to April 2, 1994 and that season
reached the NBA Finals before losing to the  Houston Rockets .  The Knicks had most recently won 12 straight regular-season
games when they ended the 1992-93 season with five victories and
began the next campaign with seven more.  “We’re having fun, that’s the most important thing,” said
Anthony, who moved past Oklahoma City’s  Kevin Durant  as the
NBA’s points-per-game leader at 28.44. “We’re doing the little
things and everyone is playing their part.”  The Knicks lead the Brooklyn Nets (44-32) by six games in
the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic division, and is second in the
conference behind the Miami Heat (60-16). The Nets and Heat
didn’t play yesterday.  Oklahoma City is second in the Western Conference with a
56-21 mark, one game behind the  San Antonio Spurs .  Wizards Next  New York has six regular-season games remaining, beginning
April 9 at home against the Washington Wizards. It also hosts
the  Indiana Pacers  and  Atlanta Hawks , and faces the  Chicago
Bulls , Cleveland Cavaliers and  Charlotte  Bobcats on the road.  Indiana is third in the Eastern Conference with a 48-29
mark, followed by Brooklyn, Chicago, Atlanta and Boston. The
Bulls lost yesterday to the Detroit Pistons 99-85, while the
Celtics beat the Wizards 107-96.  The Los Angeles Clippers yesterday clinched the first
division title in the franchise’s 42-year history with a 109-95
win against the Los Angeles Lakers.  Chris Paul  had 24 points and
12 assists for the Clippers (51-26), who ended the Lakers’ five-
year reign atop the Pacific Division and swept the season series
for the first time since 1974-75.  The Memphis Grizzlies and Bobcats are now the only two
current NBA franchises to have never won a division title. The
Grizzlies improved to 52-25 -- the West’s fourth-best record --
with yesterday’s 89-87 win over the Sacramento Kings, yet are
five games behind San Antonio in the Southwest Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
