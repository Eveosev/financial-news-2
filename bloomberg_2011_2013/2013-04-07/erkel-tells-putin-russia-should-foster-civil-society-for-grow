German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said
that Russia should foster civil society including allowing
greater freedom to non-governmental organizations to help spur
innovation and wealth.  “We are convinced that this is best achieved when there is
an active civil society,” Merkel said today in a speech in
Hanover, where she and Russian President  Vladimir Putin  opened
the annual trade fair.  Russia and Germany have already addressed such topics,
“and we must intensify this discussion, develop our respective
views and give non-governmental organizations in Russia, and the
many other groups that we in Germany recognize as drivers of
innovation, a decent chance,” Merkel said to applause from the
audience.  Relations between the two countries have been strained by
Russian raids of German NGOs, including the Konrad Adenauer
Foundation, which is affiliated to Merkel’s Christian Democratic
Union party. Putin stressed in his speech the strong economic
ties between Russian and  Germany  that saw bilateral trade reach
a record $74 billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
