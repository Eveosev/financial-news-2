China plans to open the Xisha
Islands in the  South China Sea  to cruise-ship tourists ahead of
the May Day holiday, Xinhua News Agency said, citing Tan Li,
executive vice governor of the southernmost province of Hainan.  Tourists will be allowed to land on the islands for
sightseeing while eating and sleeping on their ships, Xinhua
cited Tan as saying. Cruise-ship tours were chosen because
hotels and other facilities on the islands are inadequate to
accommodate visitors, he was cited as saying.  The Xisha Islands, a cluster of islets, sandbanks and reefs
also known as the Paracels, are claimed by China, Vietnam and
Taiwan.  --Tian Ying. Editor:  Garry Smith   To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Tian Ying in
