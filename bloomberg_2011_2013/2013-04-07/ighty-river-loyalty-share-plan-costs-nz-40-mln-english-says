New Zealand Finance Minister  Bill English  expects a  loyalty program  to encourage residents to hold
shares in Mighty River Power Ltd. for at least two years will
cost about NZ$40 million ($34 million)  The actual cost will depend on how many citizens buy shares
at the initial public offering that opens next week, and how
many hold them for two years, English told  Television New
Zealand . Investors who retain their stock will get a 1-for-25
bonus, capped at 200 shares, according to offer documents made
public April 5.  The government is offering as many as 686 million shares,
or 49 percent of Mighty River, and could raise at least NZ$1.6
billion, based on an indicative price range of NZ$2.35 to
NZ$2.80 a share, it said. It will hold back shares from the
initial sale to issue under the bonus plan, ensuring it retains
a 51 percent stake.  “It’s a balance between making sure we get the most value
we can for a taxpayer asset, and achieving something everyone
wants to achieve and that is New Zealanders as long term owners
of this company,” English said.  There were 440,000 pre-registrations of interest in the
offer which signals “fairly strong demand” although it is
likely some of those people won’t buy shares because of what
they read about the risks to the company’s outlook, he said.  “There will be some who thought there weren’t any risks
related to Mighty River because it was government owned,” he
said. “In fact it faces the same commercial risks as any
privately owned power company, and there are plenty who invest
in Contact Energy or Trustpower that face similar risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
