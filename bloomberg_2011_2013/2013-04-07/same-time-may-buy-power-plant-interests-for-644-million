Same Time Holdings Ltd. (451) , a maker of
circuit boards, may buy stakes in three Chinese  power plants 
from  GCL-Poly Energy Holdings Ltd. (3800)  Chairman Zhu Gongshan and his
family for at least HK$5 billion ($644 million).  Same Time agreed to a non-binding memorandum of
understanding on April 2 to buy the assets for cash and stock,
the company said in a statement today filed with the Hong Kong
exchange. GCL-Poly said in a separate statement that Zhu and his
family are beneficiaries of a trust that owns the power-plant
interests.  GCL-Poly, the biggest maker of wafers for solar cells, said
it has an option and right of first refusal on the transaction
and it’s not certain yet whether the company will exercise those
rights. Same Time said the deal may constitute a reverse
takeover and change in control.  The stakes include the Taicang Harbour Power Plant, the
Lanxi Power Plant and the Guohua Taicang Power Plant, according
to the GCL-Poly statement.  The size of the deal is subject to a valuation of the
target companies by an independent assessor, Same Time said. The
purchase is also dependent on the signing of a formal agreement
and GCL-Poly confirming that it won’t exercise its option to buy
the companies.  Trading of  shares  in Same Time has been suspended since
April 2, pending the announcement of the deal. Same Time has
applied for shares to resume trading tomorrow, according to its
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
