Computer hackers briefly shut down
several Israeli government websites today in a coordinated
international assault protesting  Israel ’s treatment of the
Palestinians.  Government computer technicians took steps to protect the
most important sites against the attacks that typically disable
Internet service by flooding them with entry requests, the
Finance Ministry said in an e-mailed statement. The Foreign
Ministry website was crippled for several seconds, the statement
said.  “The most important effect is the buzz around the attack,
not any real damage caused,” said Gabi Weimann, a
communications professor at Haifa University, whose website was
also made inaccessible. “Everybody’s talking about it, but
nothing critical was brought down.”  The attacks were carried out as a one-day operation by a
loosely knit group of hackers around the world calling itself
Operation Israel, according to its postings on Twitter. Some of
the hackers posted messages on the sites such as “Free
Palestine” and “End the Occupation,” the group said.  Israel established the National Cyber Directorate two years
ago to protect vital computer systems from attack.  To contact the reporters on this story:
