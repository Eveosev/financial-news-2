Six of October Development &
Investment Co.  rose for a second day after a court ruled in
favor of its unit on a plot of land at a property development.  Shares (OCDI)  climbed 1.5 percent to 19.24 pounds at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. The benchmark EGX 30 Index advanced 1 percent.  A court in Cairo yesterday accepted the Sorial unit’s
appeal against a government agency’s decision to deny the
company a plot of land in the Eastown development, Six of
October, also known as Sodic, said in a statement today. It
means the company can keep developing the project, it said.  Eastown is a real-estate development of residential and
office units on 860,000 square meters of land east of Cairo,
according to Sodic’s website. In February, a government-
sponsored committee gave Sodic three years to develop the land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
