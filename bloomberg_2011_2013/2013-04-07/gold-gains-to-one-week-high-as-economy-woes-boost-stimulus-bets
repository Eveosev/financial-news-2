Gold rose to the highest price in
almost a week after the U.S. added the fewest workers in nine
months, increasing optimism the  Federal Reserve  will maintain
record monetary policy stimulus.  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,579.05
an ounce at 7:39 a.m. in Singapore after earlier touching
$1,583.20, the highest since April 2. Bullion for June delivery
gained 0.2 percent to $1,578.50 an ounce on the Comex.  U.S. payrolls grew by 88,000, less than the most-
pessimistic forecast in a Bloomberg survey, Labor Department
data showed April 5. Last week, the  Bank of Japan  said it will
start unprecedented stimulus and European Central Bank President
 Mario Draghi  said the institution is prepared to cut  interest
rates  if the economy deteriorates further. Chinese President Xi
Jinping said yesterday that the global economy has entered a
period of “profound readjustment” and recovery remains elusive.  “Economic circumstances in Europe and the U.S. are set to
deteriorate and gold will be the biggest beneficiary,”  Gavin Wendt , a director of Mine Life Pty in Sydney, said in a report
dated yesterday.  The Federal Reserve last month left unchanged plans to hold
its target interest rate near zero percent as long as U.S.
unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The central bank also
said it will continue its $85 billion in monthly asset purchases.  Spot silver gained as much as 0.4 percent to $27.445 an
ounce and was little changed at $27.3613. Platinum was little
changed at $1,538.50 an ounce, while palladium rose 0.3 percent
to $730.55 an ounce.  To contact the reporter for this story:
