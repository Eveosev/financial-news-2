Dubai Islamic Bank PJSC (DIB)  climbed to
the highest level in almost two years as the biggest Shariah-
compliant lender in the  United Arab Emirates  paid a government
loan it got in 2008 before it was due.  The shares jumped 4.1 percent to 2.27 dirhams, the highest
close since April 2011. About 25 million shares were traded, or
almost five times the three-month daily average, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The benchmark DFM General Index lost
0.3 percent.  DIB’s surge takes this year’s gain to 13 percent, compared
with a 16 percent advance in Dubai’s gauge. The bank, which is
taking over mortgage lender  Tamweel PJSC (TAMWEEL) , paid back the 3.75
billion-dirham ($1 billion) loan it received from the U.A.E.
Finance Ministry during the global financial crisis.  National
Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC  and  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB)  are
also among lenders that have repaid all or part of the funds
owed to the ministry.  DIB’s “robust liquidity position” helped pay the loan
ahead of time, the bank said in a regulatory filing.  The stock’s  14-day relative strength index  rose to 70
today. A reading above this level indicates to some analysts
that the security is poised to decline. Two analysts have a buy
rating on the shares, two say hold and two recommend selling,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
