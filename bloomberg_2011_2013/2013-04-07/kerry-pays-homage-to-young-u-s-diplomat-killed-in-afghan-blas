A visibly moved U.S. Secretary of
State  John Kerry  today paid homage to a 25-year-old American
diplomat who served as his aide during his visit to Kabul and
was killed in a blast yesterday in Southern Afghanistan.  Anne Smedinghoff from  Illinois  was one of six people killed
in an attack on a U.S. convoy. She was on her second tour and
arrived to Kabul last summer. Kerry spoke about the young
foreign service officer after arriving to Istanbul during a
meeting with consulate workers.  “We know too well the risks in the world today for all of
our State Department personnel at home and around the world,”
Kerry said yesterday in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
