No. 1 seed Louisville and fourth-
seed  Michigan  will meet tomorrow night to determine the national
men’s college basketball championship.  Louisville rallied from 12 points down in the second half
to defeat Wichita State University 72-68 before Michigan knocked
off Syracuse 61-56 to reach the National Collegiate Athletic
Association title game at the Georgia Dome in Atlanta.  Louisville will make its first appearance in the
championship since 1986, while Michigan will return for the
first time since the school lost in the 1993 title game to North
Carolina. The Cardinals also won the championship in 1980 while
the Wolverines, the first No. 4 seed to play in the title game
since  Arizona  in 1997, will be seeking a second national title
to go with its 1989 championship.  “Louisville is going to be a difficult game,” Michigan
coach John Beilein said in a press conference. “(Rick Pitino)
is a brilliant coach with great schemes. It’s going to be very
difficult. But I need to study him a little bit more before I
know exactly what to expect.”  Michigan has lost both games it has played against
Louisville by a total of four points. The two schools haven’t
played each other since meeting in a pair of home-and-home games
in the 1977-78 and 1978-79 seasons.  Louisville is given a 64 percent chance to win the national
championship, according to R.J. Bell of Pregame.com in Las Vegas.
A $200 bet on the Cardinals would earn $100 and a $100 wager on
Michigan wins $170. Louisville is a four-point favorite to win
at the Hilton and the MGM Mirage in Las Vegas.  Wolverines Lead  The Wolverines held a 36-25 lead at halftime and never
trailed in the second half as junior guard Tim Hardaway Jr. led
all Michigan scorers with 13 points. The Wolverines, who
defeated Florida and  Kansas  to reach the semifinal game, had
three players scoring at least 10 points, including freshman
forward Mitch McGary, who had 10 points and 12 rebounds.  After Syracuse’s James Sutherland hit a three-pointer with
42 seconds remaining to pull the Orange within one point of the
lead, Michigan pulled away, scoring the game’s final five points.
Junior forward Jordan Morgan sealed the victory with a two-
handed dunk with two seconds remaining.  Fair Game  Syracuse junior forward C.J. Fair finished the game with 22
points as senior guard Brandon Triche added 11 points.  The loss marked the first defeat in four semifinal game
appearances for Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim and the first time
Michigan’s Beilein has beaten Boeheim in 10 meetings.  In last night’s first game, Wichita State jumped out to an
8-0 lead five minutes into the game and held a 47-35 lead with
13 minutes, 40 seconds left in the second half. Louisville
chipped away at the advantage until Luke Hancock hit a 3-pointer
to give the Cardinals the lead at 56-55. Hancock then hit
another 3-pointer with two minutes left to build Louisville its
biggest lead of the day at 65-60.  “I kept telling the guys it’s about defense,” said
Louisville coach Rick Pitino during a televised interview. “The
tempo was not ours. We beat a great team tonight.”  Pitino not only won a trip to the NCAA final, his
thoroughbred, Goldencents, came in first in the Santa Anita
Derby to lock up a spot in the Kentucky Derby.  Russ Smith scored 21 points and Hancock came off the bench
to add 20, including six in the final two minutes, for the
Cardinals (34-5), who had won 15 straight games.  “We just had to come out and execute in the offense in the
second half,” Hancock said. “Wichita State is an unbelievable
team.”  Cleanthony Early had 24 points and 10 rebounds and Carl
Hall scored 13 for the Shockers (30-9), who had knocked out No.
1 Gonzaga and second-seeded Ohio State to reach its first Final
Four since 1965.  To contact the reporter on this story:
