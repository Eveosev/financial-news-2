Egypt ’s Islamist president could
call for early presidential elections if he feels he has failed
in running the country, though such a step would be ill-timed at
present, Justice Minister Ahmed Mekki said in a televised
interview.  The comments came as Mekki said on the independent Al-Hayat
satellite channel that, to his credit, one of the positive steps
taken by President Mohamed Mursi’s ousted predecessor,  Hosni Mubarak , was leaving his office.  Asked if Mursi had a similarly positive attribute and would
consider such a step, Mekki said it was an option if the
president “feels he has failed in administrating the state, but
this isn’t good.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
