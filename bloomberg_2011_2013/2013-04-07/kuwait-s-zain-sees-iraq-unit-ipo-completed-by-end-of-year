Mobile Telecommunications Co. (ZAIN) ,
Kuwait’s largest mobile-phone operator, said its Iraqi unit may
not complete an initial public offering until the end of 2013.  “The formation of the joint stock exchange company is
taking longer than expected due to local governmental
procedures,” the Kuwaiti company, known as Zain, said in a
statement today. “There was never a deadline, it’s only
expectations. We hope that it will be completed by the second
half of this year, but it will depend on how long it will take
for the procedures to be concluded.”  Zain said in February that the division planned to list 25
percent of its shares on the Iraq Stock Exchange by the end of
the first half. The stock sale would follow a $1.3 billion IPO
by Asiacell Communications PJSC, majority-owned by  Qatar Telecom
QSC (QTEL) , which started trading in  Baghdad  in February.  Regulatory procedures for the Iraqi IPO should be completed
by mid-2013, Zain said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
