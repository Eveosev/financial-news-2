Martin O’Neill  is on the brink of
being named manager of the Ireland national soccer team and will
appoint Roy Keane as his assistant, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported on its website.  O’Neill, 61, would replace Giovanni Trapattoni, who left
the position in September after Ireland was eliminated from
 World Cup  qualifying. O’Neill last managed Sunderland, which
fired him in March, with Celtic and Aston Villa among his other
clubs.  Keane, 42, played 67 games for Ireland, but walked out of
the squad prior to the 2002 World Cup after falling out with
then-manager Mick McCarthy. He previously managed Sunderland and
Ipswich Town.  Ireland plays exhibition matches against Latvia on Nov. 15
and Poland four days later. The squad for those games will be
named on Nov. 5 and O’Neill could be appointed by then, the  BBC 
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
