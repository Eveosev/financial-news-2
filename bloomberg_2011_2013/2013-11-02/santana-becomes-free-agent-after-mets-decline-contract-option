Johan Santana , who pitched the  New
York  Mets’ first no-hitter in 2012, became a free agent when the
Major League Baseball team declined a $25 million option on his
contract.  A two-time Cy Young Award winner for the  Minnesota Twins  in
2004 and 2006, the 34-year-old Santana was among 11 players
added to the free-agent list yesterday, according to the
players’ union.  Instead of receiving the option in the seventh year of his
contract with the Mets, Santana was paid a buyout of $5.5
million.  “I am not sure what the future holds, as this is all new
to me, but I have every intention of pitching in 2014 and beyond
and I am certainly keeping all my options open,” Santana said
in a statement.  Santana struggled with injuries during his years with the
Mets while posting a 46-34 record and a 3.18 earned run average
over parts of four seasons. He had elbow surgery in 2009 and
tore the anterior capsule in his left shoulder in 2010, forcing
him to miss the 2011 season.  This year, Santana reinjured his shoulder and needed more
surgery.  To contact the reporter on this story:
