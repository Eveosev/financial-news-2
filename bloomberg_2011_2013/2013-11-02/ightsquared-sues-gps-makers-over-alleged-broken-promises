LightSquared Inc.,  Philip Falcone ’s
wireless spectrum company, sued GPS manufacturers over claims
their misrepresentations about the flawed designs of their
products forced LightSquared into bankruptcy.  The lawsuit was filed yesterday in  U.S. Bankruptcy Court  in
 Manhattan  against  Deere & Co. (DE) , Garmin International Inc.,
 Trimble Navigation Ltd. (TRMB) , the U.S. GPS Industry Council and the
Coalition to Save Our GPS.  The defendants promised that after LightSquared resolved
its “out-of-band-emissions” problems, its network wouldn’t
interfere with global positioning system receivers, according to
the complaint.  The broken promises “prevented the timely launch of a
nationwide wireless broadband network, caused LightSquared to
lose investments and contracts worth billions of dollars, and
deprived the public of much needed broadband spectrum,”
LightSquared said in the complaint.  LightSquared, based in Reston,  Virginia , filed for
bankruptcy in May 2012, listing assets of $4.48 billion and debt
of $2.29 billion. U.S. regulators blocked the service after
makers and users of GPS devices, including the U.S. military and
commercial airlines, said LightSquared’s signals would confound
navigation equipment.  In October, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman ruled
that LightSquared could halt a lawsuit that Falcone’s Harbinger
Capital Partners LLC brought against the same defendants.
LightSquared asked the court to keep the lawsuit from going
forward for 60 days because it might distract from restructuring
efforts.  Ken Golden , a spokesman for Deere & Co., said in an e-mail 
that the company doesn't comment on litigation.  The case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
