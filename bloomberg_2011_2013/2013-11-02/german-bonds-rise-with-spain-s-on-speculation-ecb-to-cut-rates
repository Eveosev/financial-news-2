German government bonds advanced for
a third week amid speculation a waning recovery will prompt the
European Central Bank to cut interest rates as soon as its
policy meeting next week.  Spanish and Italian securities also rallied as Bank of
America Corp., Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc and UBS AG all
forecast policy makers will lower borrowing costs this month
after inflation slowed to the lowest since 2009. The implied
yield on interest-rate futures dropped to the lowest in more
than five months. Greek  10-year yields  fell below 8 percent for
the first time since June 2010.  “We think the ECB should move given the inflation rate is
now well below its target,” said Salman Ahmed, a global
strategist in  London  at Lombard Odier Investment Managers, which
has $46 billion in assets. “While recent data suggested the
euro region is probably still in the growth territory, the
improvement stalled.”  Germany ’s 10-year yield dropped six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, this week to 1.69 percent after declining to
1.65 percent on Oct. 31, the lowest since Aug. 8. The 2 percent
bund maturing in August 2023 rose 0.575, or 5.75 euros per
1,000-euro ($1,348) face amount, to 102.755.  Two-year rates  fell seven basis points to 0.11 percent
after reaching 0.087 percent yesterday, the least since July 22.  ECB Predictions  Bank of America, RBS and UBS predict policy makers will cut
the main refinancing rate by 25 basis points on Nov. 7. BNP
Paribas SA, Societe Generale SA, JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
Scotiabank forecast a reduction in December, when the central
bank will publish new economic projections. The ECB last lowered
its  benchmark rate  on May 2 to a record 0.5 percent.  The implied yield on Euribor contracts expiring in
December 2014, a measure of the outlook for three-month money-market rates, dropped 11 basis points this week to 0.39 percent
after reaching 0.355 percent, the lowest level since May 23.  Spanish  10-year yields  declined 19 basis points to 3.97
percent, the least since May 3. Similar-maturity Italian rates
fell 12 basis points this week to 4.11 percent.  Fitch Ratings revised its credit outlook for Spain to
stable from negative yesterday, citing improved financing
conditions and progress with banking sector restructuring. It
maintained its rating at BBB.  Euro-area inflation unexpectedly slowed to 0.7 percent in
October, the ninth straight month it has been less than the
ECB’s 2 percent ceiling, European Union data showed Oct. 31. A
separate report showed unemployment climbed to a record 12.2
percent in September.  Greece ’s 10-year yield declined 63 basis points this week
to 7.99 percent after falling to 7.90 percent, the lowest level
since June 2, 2010. The  rate surged  to 44.21 percent in March
2012 as the government forced losses on investors as part of a
debt swap that saw it issue new securities at less than 30
percent of face amount.  German bonds rose 0.5 percent last month, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italy’s bonds returned 2.8 percent
while Spain’s gained 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
