Lenders including  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C)  will have to show they can survive the
demise of a trading partner or a plunge in value of high-risk
business loans in the 2014 version of U.S. stress tests.  The scenarios for the annual tests, outlined by the Federal
Reserve in a statement yesterday, reflect some of the most
pressing threats seen by regulators as they gauge the ability of
the U.S. financial system to withstand economic shocks. Bankers
will have to show what would happen to the value of leveraged
loans they hold, the impact of another housing bust and how
they’d fare if a firm that owes them substantial sums collapses.  The test was designed in part to build resiliency against
what some see as emerging asset bubbles, said a Fed official who
spoke on a conference call with reporters. The counterparty
failure test aims to prevent a repeat of the 2008 crisis, when
distress at Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and American 
International Group Inc. threatened to destroy their biggest
trading partners.  Counterparty credit risk “has been a very big concern
since the crisis,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner at
Federal Financial Analytics Inc., a Washington regulatory 
research firm whose clients include the world’s largest banks. 
“This is an intervening supervisory step while the broader rules 
are pending.”  The Fed is using the tests -- based on hypothetical adverse
conditions and not forecasts -- to encourage the 30 biggest
banks to build capital cushions against economic turmoil. Twelve
banks will be subject to the capital review for the first time.  Global Shock  The six banks with large trading operations -- JPMorgan,
Citigroup,  Bank of America Corp. , Goldman Sachs Group Inc.,
Morgan Stanley and  Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC)  -- will be required to test
how their portfolios would perform against a global shock to
financial markets. Details of that scenario will be released
“soon,” the central bank said. New York-based JPMorgan is the
biggest U.S. bank by assets, followed by  Charlotte , North
Carolina-based Bank of America and New York-based Citigroup.  Those six banks, as well as  Bank of New York Mellon Corp. 
and  State Street Corp. (STT) , also will have to test against a
scenario in which one of their counterparties experiences an
“instantaneous and unexpected” default. Previous tests focused
merely on incremental defaults as the economy eroded, a Fed
official said on the conference call.  Weak Support  The test shows Fed officials remain concerned that banks
might still rely too heavily on a single counterparty to hedge
potential losses, a practice that contributed to the 2008
financial crisis.  In the “adverse” scenario, banks will be tested against
global flight from long-term debt that pushes the U.S. into a
recession, with unemployment rising to 9.25 percent. The yield
on the U.S. 10-year Treasury note jumps to 5.75 percent by the
end of 2014, and corporate bond and mortgage rates also rise.  In the Fed’s “severely adverse” scenario, the jobless
rate peaks at 11.25 percent, stocks fall almost 50 percent and
U.S. housing prices slide 25 percent, while the euro area sinks
into recession. Developing economies in Asia also experience a
“sharp slowdown,” the Fed said.  The Fed said the larger drop in U.S. house prices in this
year’s severely adverse scenario is “particularly relevant for
states or metropolitan statistical areas that have experienced
brisk gains in house prices over the past year.”  Wider Spreads  The wider corporate borrowing spreads featured in both
tests are “intended to represent a corresponding widening in
spreads across all corporate borrowing rating tiers and
instruments, particularly those instruments -- such as high-yield corporate bonds and leveraged loans -- that are at present
experiencing particularly narrow spreads,” the Fed said.  Top banking regulators in the U.S. are recommending lenders
strengthen underwriting standards for leveraged corporate loans
as borrowing of the high-risk debt approaches levels not seen
since before the financial crisis, nine people with knowledge of
the matter said last month.  Some bankers and economists have said stresses may emerge
when the central bank decides to end its current economic
stimulus program that has kept rates near historic lows. The
program involves buying $85 billion a month in bonds to suppress
borrowing costs. Speculation about the timing earlier this year
sent interest rates soaring in a matter of weeks.  “They seem to be avoiding the biggest risks in the stress
scenarios,” said Chris Whalen, managing director at Carrington
Investment Services LLC in Greenwich,  Connecticut . “The Fed
itself has created this interest-rate risk by bringing rates
down to zero, so maybe that’s why it’s not able to stress too
much.”  Bubble Trouble  Morgan Stanley (MS)  Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 55,
said yesterday he doesn’t see evidence of market bubbles
developing and that investors should celebrate when the Fed
begins to taper its support program because it will signal the
economy is healthy.  Gorman, whose New York-based company runs the world’s
largest brokerage, was responding to remarks by BlackRock Inc.
CEO Laurence D. Fink, 61, who said Oct. 29 that the Fed’s effort
to boost the economy by holding down interest rates has fueled
“bubble-like markets.” His firm is the world’s biggest money
manager.  Banks have argued in past years that they can mitigate
risks in their business deals by purchasing protection, such as
credit-default swaps, from counterparties.  AIG’s Collapse  In the years leading up to the 2008 crisis, financial firms
bought protection from AIG, the New York-based insurer, allowing
them to subtract the CDS on their books from their reported
subprime mortgage-debt holdings because losses would
theoretically be covered by AIG.  When prices of mortgage securities started falling in 2008,
the contracts required AIG to post more collateral to its CDS
counterparties. The demands drained AIG’s cash, and the U.S.
government took over the company when it was hours away from
bankruptcy.  If AIG had collapsed, the protection that its clients had
counted upon for their mortgage portfolios would have
disappeared, leading to billions of dollars in losses and
perhaps a cascade of bank failures.  The Fed, seeking to reduce the chance that one failing
company would topple others, proposed in December 2011 to cap
how much counterparty credit risk a bank could have with any
systemically important trading partner. The limit would be 10
percent of regulatory capital.  Lobbying Limbo  The proposal has been stuck in limbo without being
finalized after heavy lobbying by banks. JPMorgan, Citigroup and
Morgan Stanley were among lenders arguing that the limit was
poorly constructed, overstated risk and would restrain the
economy. It could cut U.S. economic growth and destroy 300,000
jobs, New York-based Goldman Sachs warned last year.  “The regulators have been looking for a way to get
counterparty risk into the scenarios,” said Mark Levonian, a
former senior deputy comptroller at the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency. Levonian, now a managing director
at the consulting firm Promontory Financial Group LLC in
 Washington , said the stress tests also show regulators’ concern
that “recent price gains in some regional housing markets might
not hold up under stress.”  Companies will have until the first week of January to
submit their capital plans, and the results will be released in
March.  Capital Increases  The 18 bank holding companies tested previously have
increased their aggregate Tier 1 common capital to $836 billion
in the second quarter of 2013 from $392 billion in the first
quarter of 2009, according to Fed data. Their Tier 1 common
ratio, which compares capital to risk-weighted assets, has more
than doubled to a weighted average of 11.1 percent from 5.3
percent, the Fed said.  The eight banks with more complicated scenarios have been
through the Fed’s stress test and capital-planning process
before, as have  Ally Financial Inc. (ALLY) ,  American Express Co. (AXP) ,  BB&T
Corp. (BBT) ,  Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) ,  Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB) ,
 KeyCorp (KEY) , PNC Financial Services Group Inc.,  Regions Financial
Corp. (RF) ,  SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI)  and U.S. Bancorp.  Twelve banks will be participating in the process for the
first time. Those banks are BMO Financial Corp., BBVA Compass
Bancshares, Inc.,  Comerica Inc. (CMA) ,  Discover Financial Services (DFS) ,
HSBC North America Holdings Inc., Huntington Bancshares Inc.,
 M&T Bank Corp. (MTB) ,  Northern Trust Corp. (NTRS) , RBS Citizens Financial
Group, Inc., Santander Holdings USA, Inc., UnionBanCal Corp.,
and Zions Bancorp.  To contact the reporters on this story:
