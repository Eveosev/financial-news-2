Three bottles of Romanee-Conti 2006 Domaine de la Romanee-Conti fetched $31,070 at a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. auction in Chicago, taking top slot at a sale in which Burgundies accounted for four of the six most expensive bids.  A case of La Tache 1991 DRC sold for $28,680 and three magnums of Le Pin 2000 Pomerol fetched $26,290, all three top lots matching their presale estimates, according to results in a Hart statement. A case of La Tache 2000 DRC went for $23,900.  The auction came as the  Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index , tracking Bordeaux vintages from recent years, has dropped since March 15, paring an 8 percent gain made in the previous 10 weeks to leave it less than 1 percent up this year. Auction demand for historic vintages and rare Burgundies contrasts with muted investor appetite for younger Bordeaux, even as signs of trading interest on the London-based Liv-ex point to a broadening of the market.  “This week the number of active markets on Liv-ex, wines with either a bid or an offer placed against them on the exchange, reached a record high,” Liv-ex said in its market blog. “While largely down to an increase in offers, over the last month the number of bids has risen too.”  Other rare bottles in the Hart sale, held on Oct. 25 and Oct. 26, included an 18-liter Melchior of Chateau Cheval Blanc 2005, which sold for $22,705. A case of Chambertin 1996 Armand Rousseau Burgundy fetched $21,510, a world record according to Hart, while a 12-bottle lot of Barolo Riserva Collina Rionda 1989 Bruno Giacosa from Italy achieved the same price.  The auction totaled $4.7 million, with all 2,064 lots sold, taking  Hart ’s auction business up 32 percent so far in 2013 compared with the same period last year.
