The pound posted its biggest weekly
decline versus the dollar since July as signs the U.S. economy
is strengthening fueled bets the Federal Reserve will slow
stimulus that tends to debase the greenback.  Sterling fell for a second week against the U.S. currency
as a gauge of whether U.K. data is beating forecasts dropped to
the lowest level since June. Gauges of consumer sentiment and
manufacturing output both fell short of economists’ estimates.
The pound strengthened the most in five weeks versus the euro
amid speculation the European Central Bank will cut interest
rates as soon as next week to revive growth. U.K. gilts dropped,
with 10-year yields rising from a two-month low.  “The pound is down against a strong dollar and winning
against a weak euro,” said Adam Cole, head of Group-of-10
currency strategy at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “It’s not
to do with its own fundamentals. There’s better dollar sentiment
on the Fed outlook and this week there’s been a big shift in
sentiment against the euro with people pricing in ECB rate
cuts.”  The pound fell 1.5 percent this week to $1.5925 at 5 p.m.
in London yesterday, the steepest drop since the period ended
July 5. Sterling gained 0.8 percent to 84.69 pence per euro, the
biggest increase since Sept. 27.  Britain’s currency will appreciate to 82 pence per euro by
the end of the year as the U.K. economy outperforms that of the
euro region, RBC’s Cole predicted. That would be the strongest
since January.  Surprise Index  The Citigroup U.K. Economic Surprise Index fell for a
seventh day to 17.7 yesterday, the lowest since June 17. The
gauge, which shows whether data beat or fell short of
economists’ forecasts, climbed to this year’s high of 113.30 on
Aug. 19.  GfK NOP Ltd. said on Oct. 31 its index of consumer
sentiment dropped to minus 11 last month from minus 10 in
September. Analysts had forecast an increase to minus 8. A gauge
of manufacturing, based on a survey of purchasing managers, fell
to 56 from a revised 56.3 in September, Markit Economics said
yesterday, less than a forecast 56.4.  The U.S. economy shows signs of “underlying strength,”
the Fed said on Oct. 30, fueling speculation it will begin
reducing its $85 billion monthly bond-buying stimulus sooner
than previously expected.  The pound has fallen 1.1 percent in the past month, the
worst performer after  Sweden ’s krona of 10 developed-nation
currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes.
The dollar gained 0.8 percent and the euro rose 0.5 percent.  Rate Forecasts  Sterling strengthened against the euro after Bank of
America Corp., UBS AG and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc all
predicted the ECB will cut its main  refinancing rate  to a
record-low 0.25 percent at its Nov. 7 policy meeting.  Bank of England policy makers meeting on Nov. 7 will leave
the key  interest rate  at 0.5 percent and the asset-purchase
 target  at 375 billion pounds, according to Bloomberg surveys of
economists.  The U.K.  10-year gilt  yield added three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, this week to 2.65 percent. The rate fell
to 2.52 percent on Oct. 31, the  lowest  since Aug. 13. The 2.25
percent bond due in September 2023 dropped 0.27, or 2.70 pounds
per 1,000-pound face amount, to 96.58.  Gilts returned 0.8 percent in October, according to
Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Treasuries and German bonds both
gained 0.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
