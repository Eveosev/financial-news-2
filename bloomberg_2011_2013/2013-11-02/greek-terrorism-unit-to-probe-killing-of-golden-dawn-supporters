Greece’s police chief ordered the
country’s counter-terrorism agency to conduct a preliminary
inquiry after two men were shot dead outside a local office of
the nationalist Golden Dawn party in  Athens .  Two assailants escaped on a motorbike after shooting at
four men standing on the pavement in the northern Athens suburb
of Neo Iraklio at about 7 p.m. local time yesterday, according
to a  statement  today on the Greek police force’s website.  Police sent 12 nine-millimeter shell cases found at the
crime scene for ballistic examination. Two men, aged 22 and 27,
died, while a third, aged 29, was taken to hospital in a
critical condition.  Golden Dawn said a previous request for police protection
of its offices had been denied and that it regarded the two dead
men as “members of our family,” according to a statement on
the political movement’s website.  All of  Greece ’s political parties condemned the attack.  “The killers, whoever they are, will be ruthlessly dealt
with by our democracy, justice system and by a united Greek
society,” government spokesman Simos Kedikoglou said, according
to an e-mailed transcript of his comments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
