The  Boston Red Sox  exercised the 2014
contract option on Major League Baseball pitcher  Jon Lester ,
winner of two World Series starts, General Manager  Ben Cherington  said.  The team didn’t disclose financial terms. Lester completed
the final year of a five-year, $30 million contract that had a
$13 million team option for the 2014 season, according to ESPN.  Lester, 29, won 19 of his 38 starts this year between the
regular season and the postseason, combining for a 3.45 earned
run average and 206 strikeouts. During the regular season, he
was 15-8 with a 3.75 ERA and led the team with 33 games started,
213 1/3 innings pitched, 177 strikeouts and 20 quality starts.  In the postseason when the Red Sox won their eighth World
Series Championship, he tallied a 1.56 ERA and 29 strikeouts in
five starts.  Lester, selected by the  Red Sox  in the second round of the
2002 amateur draft, owns a 100-56 record with a 3.76 ERA in 221
career regular-season appearances. Lester’s 1,237 career
strikeouts are the most by a Red Sox left-hander and rank fifth
overall in franchise history.  Lester and New York Yankees pitcher CC Sabathia are the
only pitchers to record at least 15 wins in five of the last six
seasons from 2008-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
