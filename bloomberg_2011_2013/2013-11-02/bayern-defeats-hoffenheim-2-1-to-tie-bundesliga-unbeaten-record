Bayern Munich  beat Hoffenheim 2-1 to
tie the record for the longest unbeaten run in the history of
German soccerâ€™s Bundesliga.  Mario Mandzukic and  Thomas Mueller  scored the goals as
Bayern matched the mark of 36 games unbeaten set by Hamburg in
1982 and 1983. The defending German and European champion will
set the record by avoiding defeat next weekend against Augsburg.  The victory keeps Bayern one point ahead of Borussia
Dortmund, which beat Stuttgart 6-1 last night. Bayer Leverkusen
dropped four points back in third place after a 1-0 loss at
Eintracht Braunschweig.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
