Hall of Famer Walt Bellamy, an
Olympic gold medalist and four-time National Basketball
Association All-Star, has died at the age of 74.  The  Atlanta Hawks , one of Bellamy’s former teams, and the
NBA “have lost a giant,” the Hawks said yesterday without
giving details of his death.  Bellamy averaged 20.1 points and 13.7 rebounds over the 13
seasons and one game he played in the NBA. He was one of seven
players to score more than 20,000 points and tally more than
14,000 rebounds, joining  Wilt Chamberlain ,  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar ,
Elvin Hayes, Robert Parish and  Karl Malone .  “Walt Bellamy was an enormously gifted Hall of Fame player
who had a tremendous impact on our game,” NBA Commissioner
 David Stern  in a statement. “Off the court, he was an even more
extraordinary person.”  Bellamy, born in New Bern,  North Carolina , was drafted
first overall by the Chicago Packers in 1961 after winning
Olympic gold in 1960 and being named a second-team All-American
at Indiana University. He won NBA Rookie of the Year honors in
1962, All-Star status in his first four seasons, and was elected
to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1993.  Traded to New York in 1965 for Johnny Green, John Egan, Jim
Barnes and cash, he later played for  Detroit , Atlanta and New
Orleans, which waived him at the age of 35 after he recorded six
points and five rebounds in 14 minutes of the first game of the
season.  Bellamy’s scoring average dropped off for six seasons,
giving the impression he wasn’t dedicated to the game.  “Walt wasn’t a highly motivated player, night in and night
out,” said Bob Leonard, Bellamy’s first NBA coach, according to
the player’s biography on NBA.com. “He’d have some great games
and then he’d have one where he didn’t show up. But he was an
excellent player.”  When he retired in 1974, he was sixth all-time in NBA
scoring with 20,941 points and third all-time in rebounding at
14,241 rebounds. His .516 shooting percentage was third best in
the league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
