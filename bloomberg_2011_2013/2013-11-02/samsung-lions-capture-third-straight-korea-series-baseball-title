The Samsung Lions won the Korean
Series professional baseball championship for a third straight
year last night, defeating the Doosan Bears 7-3 in the deciding
seventh game at their home Daegu Stadium.  The Lions broke open a 2-2 tie by scoring five runs in the
sixth inning with the help of a throwing error by Bears third-baseman Lee Won Seok on a play at home plate. Doosan’s Son Si
Heon hit a solo home run in the seventh inning.  Right-hander Ahn Ji Man pitched one inning to get the win
for Samsung, which came back from losing the first two games of
the series. Derek Hankins threw 1.1/3 innings to take the loss
for the Bears.  “I’m always hungry for wins,” Lions’ manager Ryu Joong Il
was quoted as saying by Yonhap News. “I want to win another
championship next year.” Samsung has now won both the regular
season pennant and the Korea Series championship three years
running.  To contact the reporter on this story:
