  Hedge funds  are unloading bullish
bets on gold as a slide in prices sends the metal to its worst
start to a year since 1997. Holdings in silver dropped to the
lowest since February.  Managed-money funds held net-long positions, or wagers on
rising prices, totaling 134,473 contracts on the Comex in  New
York  as of Jan. 18, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data showed on Jan. 21. The gold holdings have plunged for three
straight weeks, dropping 21 percent since the end of December,
while net-long positions in silver are down 24 percent.  Gold has fallen 5.7 percent this month, which would be the
worst start to a year since a 6.3 percent drop in January 1997.
The metal rose every year for the past decade, reaching a record
of $1,432.50 an ounce on Dec. 7 as central banks kept  interest
rates  low and  Europe ’s debt crisis spurred demand for the metal
as a haven. Silver climbed 84 percent last year and reached a
30-year high of $31.275 an ounce in New York on Jan. 3.  “From a technical standpoint, we’ve a strong rally in
silver and gold, and when you have that type of performance, it
prompts profit-taking,” said Brian Hicks, who helps manage $1
billion in the Global Resources Fund at U.S. Global Investors
Inc. in  San Antonio . “Money is going elsewhere to the more
traditional areas of the equity market.”  Gold for February delivery settled on Jan. 21 at $1,341,
the lowest closing price since Nov. 17. The Standard & Poor’s
500 Index of U.S. equities has gained 8.7 percent since the end
of November and touched a 28-month high on Jan. 18.  Bets on a rally in silver totaled 20,318 contracts, down 11
percent from the previous week. Silver settled at $27.427 an
ounce on the Comex on Jan. 21, capping three straight weeks of
losses that was the longest slump since March.  Appeal of Metals  The slide in gold and silver may not last, Hicks said.
Prices may rebound on concern that Europe’s debt crisis will
spread, and that record-low U.S. interest rates and the biggest  budget deficit  ever will fuel inflation, Hicks said.  “Prices are close to a short-term oversold area,” Hicks
said of the decline in gold and silver. “We’re starting to
become interested at these levels. The perfect storm is
continuing to build for precious metals.”  Managed-money positions include hedge funds, commodity-
trading advisers and commodity pools. Analysts and investors
follow changes in speculator positions because such transactions
may reflect an expectation of a shift in prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
