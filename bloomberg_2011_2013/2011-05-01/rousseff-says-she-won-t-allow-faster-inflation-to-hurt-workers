Brazil’s President  Dilma Rousseff  said
the government won’t allow inflation to quicken, reducing the
purchasing power of wages,  Agencia Brasil  reported.  Rousseff, in a letter read today in an event in Sao Paulo,
said that “under any hypothesis” would she allow inflation to
negatively impact worker pay.  The letter was read by Rousseff’s Secretary General
Gilberto Carvalho at the event to celebrate the International
Workers’ Day, the government’s Brasilia-based news agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
