Russia criticized allied airstrikes in
Libya after reports said a bombing killed  Muammar Qaddafi ’s
youngest son and three grandchildren.  The Foreign Ministry said the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization attacks are a disproportionate use of force that
exceed the United Nations mandate and raises doubts about claims
the coalition forces are not intent on “the destruction” of
the Libyan leader and his family, according to a  statement  on
its website.  Russia called for “an immediate cease-fire and the
beginning of a political settlement,” the statement said.  Russian Prime Minister  Vladimir Putin  has been saying
Western military efforts to overthrow Qaddafi are destroying the
nation’s infrastructure and violate a UN mandate to protect
civilians. “Who decided they had the right to execute a man,
regardless of who he is?” Putin told reporters in Copenhagen on
April 26.  Putin on March 21 likened the UN resolution and resulting
offensive to a “medieval call for a crusade.” He criticized
the U.S. for regularly resorting to force in pursuit of its
interests, in  Libya  and previously in Iraq and  Serbia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
