Dubai Aerospace Enterprise Ltd., the
aviation-services and leasing company that in March canceled an
order for 42 planes from Airbus SAS, earned a $10.4 million
profit in 2010 compared with a $21.1 million loss a year
earlier.  Revenue rose 1.8 percent to $1.6 billion, according to the
 annual report  of a shareholder, DIFC Investments LLC, posted on
Nasdaq Dubai today. DIFC Investments owns 23.3 percent of DAE.  Dubai Aerospace, set up in 2006 with the aim of becoming
one of the worldâ€™s biggest airplane lessors, ordered 100
aircraft each from Airbus and Boeing Co. in 2007, only to scale
back expansion after its financial situation weakened during the
recession in 2008 and 2009.  To contact the reporters on this story:
