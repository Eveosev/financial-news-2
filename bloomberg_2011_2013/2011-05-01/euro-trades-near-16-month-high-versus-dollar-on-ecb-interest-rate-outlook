The euro traded 0.5 percent from a 16-
month high against the dollar on speculation the  European
Central Bank  will this week signal it intends to raise interest
rates further, boosting the appeal of the region’s assets.  The common currency held gains from last month versus the
yen before European data forecast to show producer-price
inflation remained at the quickest pace in two years. The euro
extended gains against the yen after a U.S. official said that
Osama bin Laden is dead. The dollar reached a record low versus
the Swiss franc on prospects  Federal Reserve  officials will this
week reiterate they intend to keep borrowing costs near zero.  “The rhetoric that we’ve seen from ECB officials suggests
that they’re still prepared to hike further before the year is
out,” said Khoon Goh, head of market economics and strategy at
ANZ National Bank Ltd. in Wellington. “They’re very worried
about inflation. That’s continuing to keep the euro well bid.”  The euro traded at $1.4808 as of 11:52 a.m. in  Tokyo  from
$1.4807 in  New York  last week, after rising to $1.4882 on April
28, the strongest since December 2009. It traded at 120.70 yen
from 120.22 yen, after gaining 2.2 percent last month.  The dollar bought 81.51 yen from 81.19 yen, after dropping
to 81.00, the weakest since March 25. The U.S. currency touched
an all-time low of 86.26 Swiss centimes, before trading at 86.75
centimes from 86.53 centimes.  Foreign-exchange movements may be exaggerated today as
holidays in  China ,  Hong Kong ,  Malaysia , Singapore, Taiwan and
 Thailand  reduce trading volumes.  Producer Prices  Producer prices in the 17-nation euro region rose 6.6
percent in March from a year earlier, matching February’s pace
that was the quickest since September 2008, according to a
Bloomberg News survey before the data’s release tomorrow.  “We have risks of second-round effects here and there,”
ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet said, according to the
transcript of an interview with Finland’s Helsingin Sanomat and
Kauppalehti that was released on the central bank’s website on
April 26. Second-round effects refers to an increase in consumer
prices prompting bigger wage increases that feed through to
quicker inflation.  The ECB raised  interest rates  on April 7 by a quarter
percentage point to 1.25 percent. The central bank will leave
its benchmark unchanged at its May 5 meeting, a separate
Bloomberg survey showed. It will raise rates by 75.1 basis
points in the next 12 months, according to a Credit Suisse AG
index based on swaps.  Gains in the dollar were limited before Federal Reserve
policy makers including Boston Fed President  Eric Rosengren  and
Atlanta Fed President  Dennis Lockhart  speak this week.  ‘Extended Period’  Chairman Ben S. Bernanke, who has kept the target for
overnight loans between banks in a record low range of zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008, said last week there will be
no change in the rate for an “extended period,” which means
“for a couple of meetings.” The  Federal Open Market Committee 
reviews monetary policy every six to eight weeks.  “The theme of U.S. interest rates remaining low for a very
long time continued to play out as a drag on the dollar,”  John Kyriakopoulos , Sydney-based head of currency strategy at
National Australia Bank Ltd., wrote in a research note today.  Futures on the Chicago Board of Trade show a 22 percent
chance the Fed will raise its target lending rate at least a
quarter percentage point by December. That compared with a 24
percent probability a week earlier.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the greenback against the
currencies of six major U.S. trading partners was at 73.050 from
72.933, after touching 72.813, the weakest since July 2008.  South Korea ’s Won  South Korea’s won strengthened against all of its 16 major
peers after a government report showed yesterday the nation’s
overseas shipments climbed to $49.77 billion in April, up 26.6
percent from last year.  “The won is rising after exports gained and the nation
posted a trade surplus, which suggest more incoming dollars,”
Sam Hong, senior vice president at Shinhan Bank in charge of
currency strategy, said in Seoul. “However, we have to take
into consideration that the export rise and more dollar inflows
will make the won appreciate further, deteriorating the trade
balance in coming months and slowing future won gains.”  The won strengthened 0.4 percent to 1,066.85 against the
dollar and reached 1,065.50, the strongest since August 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
