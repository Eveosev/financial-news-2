Brazilian relatives of the victims of
the 2009 Air France plane crash want a neutral country to assess
the black-box from the craft,  O Estado de S.Paulo  reported,
citing Nelson Faria Marinho, who heads the association of
families who lost relatives in the accident.  Marinho said that the families don’t trust either the
French BEA air-accident investigation bureau nor the French
government with the probe, according to the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper website.  Investigators scouring the undersea wreckage of the crash
site today recovered the memory unit from the craft’s data
recorder that they say offers the best chance of explaining the
disaster.  To contact the reporters on this story:
