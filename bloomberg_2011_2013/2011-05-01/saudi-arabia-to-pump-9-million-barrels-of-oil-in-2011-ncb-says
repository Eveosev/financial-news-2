Saudi Arabia ’s oil production may
reach 9 million barrels per day on average in 2011 as global
demand increases, said an official at  National Commercial Bank ,
Saudi Arabia’s largest bank by assets.  Average prices for Saudi’s crude are expected to reach $95
per barrel, Said A. al-Shaikh, the Jeddah-based lender’s senior
vice president and its chief economist, said in a telephone
interview today.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s biggest oil exporter, reduced its
output by 800,000 barrels per day in March after raising it to
over 9 million in February, Oil Minister Ali al-Naimi said last
month. The kingdom produced 8,292,100 barrels a day in March and
it will probably go a “little higher in April,” he said.  Saudi Arabia pumped 9.02 million barrels of crude a day in
February, up 5.9 percent from the previous month, according to
official data posted April 17 on the Joint Organization Data
Initiative’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
