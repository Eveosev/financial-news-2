Thousands of protesters marched in
Hong Kong, demanding legislation to standardize work hours,
overtime pay and an annual review of statutory  minimum wage .  About 3,100 people participated in the Labor Day march from
Victoria Park to the government office in Central today,
organized by the  Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions , Mung
Siu-tat, a coordinator of the event, said in a phone interview.  The march took place on the day when the city’s statutory
minimum wage of HK$28 ($3.60) an hour took effect. Employees,
including casual and part-time workers are covered by the act,
except live-in domestic workers, students on internships and on
work-experience arrangement, according to a statement posted on
the government’s website.  Protesters carried signs demanding paid meal time during
work days and wage increases to offset inflation, according to

percent in March from a year earlier, the fastest pace since
August 2008.  The confederation also called for low-income household
subsidies and universal retirement benefits, according to
