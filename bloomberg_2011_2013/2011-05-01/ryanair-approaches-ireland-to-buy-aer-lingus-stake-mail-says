Ryanair Holdings Plc (RYA)  has approached
the Irish government to acquire Ireland’s 25 percent stake in
 Aer Lingus (AERL)  Group Plc, the  Mail on Sunday  said, without saying
where it got the information.  Ryanair already owns a 29 percent stake in Aer Lingus and
the purchase would be its third attempt to marry the airlines
after the European Commission twice blocked a takeover on
competition grounds, the newspaper said.  Piaras Kelly, an external spokesman for Dublin-based
Ryanair, declined to comment when contacted by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
