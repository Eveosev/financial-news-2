Sony Corp. (6758) , facing regulatory backlash
over delays in telling 77 million users that their personal data
may have been stolen by a hacker, aims to resume full service of
the PlayStation Network and  Qriocity  service by the month end.  Partial resumption of the networks will resume “soon,”
Sony said in a statement distributed in Tokyo today. The company
will upgrade the PlayStation 3 software and also create a chief
information security officer, it said. The services have
remained shut since April 20.  Sony has slumped the most since the aftermath of the March
11 earthquake on concern the fallout will set back efforts to
compete against  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  in online movies
and games. Sony warned customers of the security breach on April
26, six days after closing the PlayStation Network and Qriocity
video- and music-streaming services.  The electronics maker is cooperating with investigating
authorities to sue the intruders that attacked its systems,
according to the statement.  A lawsuit filed April 27 in federal court in  San Francisco 
alleges the delay left PlayStation users exposed to losses
related to any credit-card data theft. Officials in Connecticut,
the U.K. and Ireland began inquiries. The Italian Data
Protection Authority said April 28 it will contact Sony to
gather more information.  To contact the reporter on this story:
