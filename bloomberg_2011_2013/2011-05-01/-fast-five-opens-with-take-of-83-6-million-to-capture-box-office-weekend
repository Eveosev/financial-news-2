“Fast Five,” the fifth installment
in the series about elite street racers, opened as the top movie
in U.S. and Canadian theaters, taking in a record $83.6 million
for  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) ’s Universal Pictures.  “Rio,” the animated film from  News Corp. (NWSA) ’s Twentieth
Century Fox, had sales of $14.4 million, dropping to second
place after two weeks in first, researcher Hollywood.com Box-
Office said today in an e-mailed statement.  “Fast Five” lifted U.S. box-office revenue for a third
straight weekend, suggesting that with summer films opening in
theaters the industry will begin to whittle down a year-to-date
drop in sales and attendance.  It is the biggest opening since “ Harry Potter  and the
Deathly Hallows Part 1” raked in $125 million in November,
Gitesh Pandya, editor of Box Office Guru, said of “Fast Five”
in a telephone interview. “It’s the biggest opening ever in the
month of April and also the biggest opening in company history
for  Universal Pictures ,” he said. “There’s no better way to
kick start the summer box office.”  “Thor,” based on the Marvel Comics character, opens next
weekend and “Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” on
May 20.  Biggest Since Potter  In “Fast Five,” Vin Diesel returns as a renegade street
racer and professional thief on the run from authorities. He and
friends must confront a Brazilian drug lord and pursue federal
agents to win their freedom.  Paul Walker  and Dwayne Johnson co-
star.  The first four films in the series took in $955.4 million
in worldwide ticket sales, according to Box Office Mojo, another
industry researcher. With the latest installment, the franchise
topped the $1 billion mark worldwide.  “It’s pretty amazing what that franchise has been able to
do,”  Jeff Bock , a box office analyst with Exhibitor Relations
said in a telephone interview. “Usually with a fifth film in a
franchise, you don’t see it continue to raise the bar.”  “Rio,” featuring the voices of  Anne Hathaway  and  Jesse Eisenberg , tells the story of a domesticated macaw who travels
to  Rio de Janeiro  from  Minnesota  to find a mate.  ‘Big Happy Family’  The Tyler Perry comedy “Madea’s Big Happy Family” dropped
to third place from second with sales of $10.5 million for  Lions
Gate Entertainment Corp. (LGF)   The film stars Perry, in drag, in his recurring role as the
outspoken matron of a large Southern family. He also writes,
directs and produces the films.  “Water for Elephants” was fourth in its second weekend
with sales of $9.1 million for the Fox studio. The film features
“Twilight” star  Robert Pattinson  as a veterinary student who
falls in love with a circus performer played by Reese Witherspoon.  “Prom,”  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s tale of teens preparing for the
year’s biggest dance, came in fifth place with opening weekend
sales of $5 million. “Prom” features Aimee Teegarden as a
perfectionist whose infuriation with a classmate turns to
attraction. Thomas McDonell and DeVaughn Nixon co-star.  The animated feature “Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil” opened
in sixth place with $4.1 million in sales for Weinstein Co. In
the film, a teen-age Red Riding Hood is recruited into a covert
organization to investigate the disappearance of Hansel and
Gretel. Hayden Panettiere provides the voice of Red Riding Hood.
Co-stars include Patrick Warburton as the Big Bad Wolf, joined
by Joan Cusack and Amy Poehler.  Revenue for the top 12 films this past weekend gained 55
percent to $142.4 million, from a year earlier. Domestic box-
office sales so far this year have declined 14 percent to $3.04
billion, compared with the same period of 2010. Attendance
