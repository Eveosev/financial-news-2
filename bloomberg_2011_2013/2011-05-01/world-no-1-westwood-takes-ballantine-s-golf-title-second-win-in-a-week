World No. 1  Lee Westwood  scored a
final-round 67, 5-under par, to clinch victory today in golf’s
Ballantine’s Championship in  South Korea , his second win in a
week.  The Englishman finished on 12-under par in Icheon, one shot
ahead of Miguel Angel Jimenez of Spain, with Sang-Hyun Park of
South Korea a further stroke back. Westwood picked up a check
for 367,500 euros ($545,000), a week after winning the
Indonesian Masters to regain the No. 1 ranking.  Dustin Johnson  of the U.S., making his Asian debut, was
fourth on 9-under after a final-round 69.  “We had a nice bottle of red wine over dinner and I told
Jimenez that I’ll see him in the playoff,” Westwood said in a
release from the Asian Tour, co-sponsor of the event with the
European circuit. “It nearly went that way but thankfully it
didn’t go to that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
