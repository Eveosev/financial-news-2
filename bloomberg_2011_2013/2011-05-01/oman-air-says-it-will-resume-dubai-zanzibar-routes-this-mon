Oman Air , the sultanate’s state-owned
carrier, said it will resume flights to Dubai and Zanzibar from
the Gulf state this month to serve business travellers as well
as tourists in the summer season.  Salalah-Dubai flights will recommence May 4 twice weekly,
and the Muscat-Zanzibar route will operate three times a week
starting May 16, the company said in an e-mailed statement
today.  Calls to Oman Air’s main offices in Muscat weren’t answered
when Bloomberg News called seeking comment on the announcement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
