Oil dropped the most in almost seven
weeks in  London  on speculation that the killing of Osama bin Laden may ease the risk of Middle East supply disruptions.  Brent crude  futures fell as much as 3.4 percent, the most
since March 15, following reports that bin Laden was dead. The
al-Qaeda leader, who orchestrated the Sept. 11 attacks on New
York and  Washington  in 2001, died in a firefight in Abbottabad,
Pakistan, U.S. President Barack Obama said. Oil had slipped
earlier on signs that cooling economic growth in China may
temper fuel demand in the world’s biggest energy user.  “Good news on the geopolitical front has the potential to
move prices back below $100,” said Ric Spooner, chief market
analyst at  CMC Markets  in Sydney.  Bin Laden  was a symbol of
geopolitical uncertainty and terrorism whose death “carries
hope of reduced threats of terrorism and political risk in
northern  Asia  and the Middle East,” Spooner said.  Brent crude for June settlement slid as much as $4.22 to
$121.67 a barrel, the lowest price since April 20, on London’s
ICE Futures  Europe  exchange and traded 1.3 percent lower at
$124.20 at 1:32 p.m. Oil for June delivery on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  was down $1.46 at $112.47 a barrel after
falling as much as $3.11 to $110.82. The contract rose 6.8
percent last month and settled at $113.93 on April 29, the
highest since Sept. 29, 2008.  Oil has climbed 31 percent in London and 23 percent in  New
York  this year as revolts that overthrew the governments in
Tunisia and Egypt raised concern that supplies from the Middle
East would be disrupted as protests spread. Fighting between
rebels and forces loyal to Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  has
shut 1.3 million barrels a day of output in Africa’s third-
largest producer.  Bin Laden  The Saudi-born bin Laden, who helped found al-Qaeda in 1988
after fighting Soviet troops in  Afghanistan , was targeted in a
compound in Pakistan. He was 54.  For the U.S. public, bin Laden was the face of terrorism.
He appeared in videotapes threatening strikes against the West,
including a message praising the Sept. 11 attacks  as “divine
blows” against America.  Al-Qaeda and bin Laden encouraged attacks on oil production
and distribution facilities as a way to damage the economies of
the U.S. and Europe. In February 2006, Saudi Arabian security
guards foiled the group’s attack on the Abqaiq oil processing
center in  Saudi Arabia , preventing disruption to exports from
the facility which handles two-thirds of the supply of the
world’s biggest producer.  China  Purchasing  Oil also slid after a Chinese manufacturing index declined
more than forecast in April. The Purchasing Managers’ Index
slipped to 52.9 from 53.4, the logistics federation and
statistics bureau said yesterday. That was below the median
forecast of 53.9 in a Bloomberg News survey of 20 economists.  “Things are slowing down in the growth economies and that
should also slow the consumption of crude,”  Jonathan Barratt ,
managing director of Commodity Broking Services Pty in Sydney,
said by telephone today.  Asian oil demand growth will slow in the second half of
this year as fuel prices hurt consumers, JPMorgan Chase & Co.
said April 28.  Hedge funds and other traders raised their bullish bets on
oil for a second week to the highest level since reaching a
record in March. Net-long positions in oil increased by 11,202
futures and options combined, or 3.9 percent, to 301,118, in the
week ended April 26, according to the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission’s Commitments of Traders report. That’s the most
since the peak of 311,632 in the week of March 11.  Brent’s premium to U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
narrowed for a third day. The spread between the two front-month
contracts declined to $11.75 a barrel as of 1:32 p.m. London
time from $11.96 at settlement on April 29, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
