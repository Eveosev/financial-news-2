British voters will likely reject the
proposed introduction of a new election system that would rank
candidates by order of voters’ preference, according to two
polls published in newspapers today before a May 5 referendum.  Fifty-one percent of respondents to a BPIX poll for the
 Mail on Sunday  said they would reject the so-called alternative
vote, an 18 percentage point lead over supporters of this
Australian-style procedure. A separate poll in the Sunday Times
showed opponents of the alternative vote leading by 10 points.
Voters expect an alternative vote would make it easier for the
Liberal Democrats, the country’s third-largest political party,
to gain parliamentary seats, today’s polls showed.  Support for keeping the U.K.’s existing first-past-the-post
electoral system has increased in the past month, the polls
show. BPIX interviewed 2,003 people online on April 27-28. The
Sunday Times didn’t provide details of its poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
