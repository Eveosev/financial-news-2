Chelsea coach  Carlo Ancelotti  is
 Manchester City ’s first-choice replacement if  Roberto Mancini 
leaves the Premier League club at the end of the season, the
News of the World reported, without citing anyone.  Mancini is reportedly considering a return to  Italy , at
Juventus, the newspaper said. Ancelotti’s tenure at Chelsea is
in doubt after a campaign in which the Blues may not win a
trophy, the News of the World added.  Ancelotti would be keen to remain in English soccer’s top
league, although he is also likely to be in demand in Italy’s
Serie A, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
