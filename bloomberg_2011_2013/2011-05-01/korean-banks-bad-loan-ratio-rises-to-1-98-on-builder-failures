South Korean banks’ bad-debt ratio
rose to 1.98 percent of their total lending last quarter as at
least five builders sought court receivership or debt
restructuring, the  Financial Supervisory Service  said.  The ratio as of March 31 climbed from 1.9 percent three
months earlier, the FSS said in an e-mailed statement today.
Non-performing loans to developers and builders for real estate
projects increased to 18.01 percent from 16.44 percent.  The regulator said it plans to guide banks to reduce bad
debts as construction industry restructuring may deteriorate
their loan quality further. Soured debts from property projects
totaled 6.6 trillion won ($6.2 billion) as of March 31, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
