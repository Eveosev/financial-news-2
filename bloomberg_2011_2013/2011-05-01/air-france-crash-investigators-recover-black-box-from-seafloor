Investigators scouring the undersea
wreckage of the 2009 Air  France  plane crash recovered the memory
unit from the craft’s black-box data recorder that they say
offers the best chance of explaining the disaster.  The unit from the downed Airbus SAS A330’s flight data
recorder was found by a robotic submarine around 10:00 a.m. GMT
and raised from the bottom of the Atlantic nearly seven hours
later, France’s BEA air-accident investigation bureau said in an
e-mailed statement.  All 228 people on Air France Flight 447 were killed when
the Airbus SAS A330 went down during a storm in a flight from
 Rio de Janeiro  to Paris on June 1, 2009. The recovery of the
memory unit comes a month after crash investigations located the
wreckage in about 3,900 meters (12,800 feet) of water. Three
previous search operations failed.  “Until we have opened the box we can’t say whether we’ll be
able to read the data,” Martine Del Bono, a BEA spokeswoman,
said by telephone. Transporting it to the agency’s Paris
headquarters will take “a week to 10 days,” she said.  BEA President Jean-Paul Troadec has said the unit may offer
the only hope of fully understanding the cause of the 2009
crash, providing its memory withstood the impact and the effects
of almost two years on the seafloor under high pressure. A  photo
released by the BEA  appeared to show the casing of the orange
cylindrically shaped data unit to be intact.  Automated radio transmissions from the 2009 crash have
suggested the jet’s airspeed sensors failed as it flew into bad
weather, leading to a series of system failures. The BEA has
said that the exact causes may never be known without data from
the black boxes. The investigators cautioned that there is no
certainty the stored data will be readable.  According to the manufacturer,  Honeywell International
Inc. (HON) , the data recorder logs as much as 24 hours of several
hundred flight parameters, including altitude and airspeed. The
units are designed to withstand an impact of 1,500 times the
force of gravity immersion under 6,100 meters (20,000 feet) of
water for as many as 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
