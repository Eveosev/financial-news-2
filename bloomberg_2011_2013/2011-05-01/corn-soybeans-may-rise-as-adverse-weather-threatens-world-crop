Corn and soybeans may rise this week
as adverse weather in the U.S.,  China ,  Europe  and Canada
threatens world production amid increasing demand for food,
livestock feed and fuel made from the crops.  Twenty-three of 33 traders and analysts surveyed from Tokyo
to Chicago on April 29 said corn will rise, and 20 of 34
respondents forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the
Chicago Board of Trade, corn futures for July delivery rose 1.6
percent to $7.565 a bushel, and soybean futures for July
delivery advanced 0.3 percent to $13.94 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s gains in corn and soybeans were expected by the
majority of respondents surveyed on April 21. Since 2004, the
surveys have been correct 55 percent of the time for corn, and
54 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 23    Bullish on soybeans: 20
