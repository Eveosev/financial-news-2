Billionaire  Warren Buffett  said his
 Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  would consider repurchasing the
company’s shares in a declining market.  “There could be a market that was terrible for some reason
where it wouldn’t be self-defeating” to repurchase the
company’s stock, Buffett, 80, said today at a press conference
in Omaha,  Nebraska . “We would love to buy it back under those
circumstances.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
