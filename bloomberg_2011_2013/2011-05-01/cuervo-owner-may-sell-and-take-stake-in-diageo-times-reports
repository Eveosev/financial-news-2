Juan Beckman is seeking to become
Diageo Plc’s largest shareholder as he negotiates the sale of
his controlling stake in the maker of the Jose Cuervo brand of
tequila, the Sunday Times reported, without saying where it
obtained the information.  Beckman is pressing for shares in the U.K.-based Diageo
instead of cash in return for relinquishing control of the 200-
year-old family owned company, which has about a 30 percent
share of the global tequila market.  A call to the press office of London-based Diageo today 
wasn't answered. A call to San Pedro Tlaquepaque, Mexico-based
Cuervo today was answered by a person who said no one was 
available to comment immediately, and who declined to give 
his name.   To contact the reporter on this story:
