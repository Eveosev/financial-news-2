Japanese and Australian  stock futures 
rose after U.S. companies reported earnings that topped
analysts’ estimates and commodity prices gained, easing concerns
that global economic growth may slow.  American depositary receipts of Komatsu Ltd., the world’s
second-largest maker of construction equipment, advanced 0.7
percent from the closing share price in Tokyo after  Caterpillar
Inc. (CAT)  posted earnings that beat estimates. Those of  Canon Inc. (7751) ,
the world’s biggest manufacturer of cameras, climbed 0.8 percent.
Those of NTT DoCoMo Inc., Japan’s No. 1 mobile-phone operator,
rose 0.7 percent after forecasting profit will rise this fiscal
year. ADRs of Australian miner and oil producer  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) 
gained 0.5 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,935 in  Chicago  on April 29, compared with 9,925
in Singapore. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,920 in Osaka,
at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
Index advanced 0.7 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
slid 0.2 percent in Wellington.  “In addition to U.S. companies having good earnings,
Japanese companies’ earnings were not so bad. That’s improving
investors’ sentiment in the market,” said Toshiyuki Kanayama, a
market analyst at Tokyo-based Monex Inc. “Excessive worries
about the future of economy and companies’ earnings are
receding.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index increased 0.2
percent today. In New York, the index rose 0.2 percent to
1,363.61 on April 29.  U.S. Earnings  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, posted first-quarter profit that topped analysts’
estimates and raised its full-year earnings forecast as sales
surged in developing countries.  Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. (GT) , the largest U.S. tiremaker,
also reported first-quarter profit and sales that beat analysts’
estimates as it won higher prices.  Also, a government report showed  consumer spending  in the
U.S. climbed in March as Americans spent more on food and fuel.
Purchases rose 0.6 percent after a revised 0.9 percent gain in
February that was higher than previously estimated, Commerce
Department figures showed on April 29. The increase compared
with the 0.5 percent median estimate of economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News.  Crude Oil  NTT DoCoMo said net income will climb 2.3 percent this
fiscal year as revenue from data services offsets a decline in
voice-call traffic.  Crude oil for June delivery rose 1 percent to $113.93 a
barrel on April 29 in New York, the highest settlement since
Sept. 22, 2008, as the better-than-expected consumer spending
signaled demand for fuel may climb. The London Metal Exchange
Index of six metals including copper and aluminum advanced 0.3
percent on April 28.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index increased 1.3 percent this year
through April 29, compared with gains of 8.4 percent by the S&P
500 and 2.9 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the
Asian benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings on
average, compared with 13.8 times for the S&P 500 and 11.5 times
for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
