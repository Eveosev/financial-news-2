Brazil ’s President  Dilma Rousseff  was
diagnosed with a mild case of pneumonia after undergoing exams
at the Sirio-Libanes Hospital in Sao Paulo this weekend,  Folha
de S. Paulo  reported, citing Roberto Kalil Filho, her doctor.  Rousseff, who is taking antibiotics, left the hospital this
afternoon and will be able to work tomorrow, the Sao Paulo-based
newspaper said on its website, citing Kalil. Kalil described the
president’s health as “fine,” Folha reported.  In April 2009 Rousseff announced that she was being treated
for lymphoma. Her doctors pronounced her in “excellent health”
in September 2009.  Phone calls to the hospital and the presidential press
office by Bloomberg News weren’t answered.  To contact the reporters on this story:
