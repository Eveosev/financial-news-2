Zeltia SA (ZEL)  will miss out on a $10
million payment from  Johnson & Johnson (JNJ)  after the U.S. drugmaker
withdrew an application to use Zeltia’s Yondelis to treat
ovarian cancer, the Madrid-based company said in a regulatory
filing.  Johnson & Johnson stopped its bid to have Yondelis approved
for use alongside Doxil for the disease after the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration requested additional phase three trials of
the treatment, Zeltia said.  Zeltia’s Pharma Mar SA unit was due to receive the payment
from Johnson & Johnson once Yondelis was approved for that use
in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
