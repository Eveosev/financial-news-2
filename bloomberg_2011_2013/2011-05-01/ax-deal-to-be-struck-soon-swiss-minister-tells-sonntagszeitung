Switzerland and Germany may wrap up
their negotiations on an agreement on untaxed assets in Swiss
bank accounts and a withholding tax around the middle of the
year, Swiss Finance Minister Eveline Widmer-Schlumpf told
 SonntagsZeitung  in an interview.  “We are approaching the end” of the talks, Widmer-
Schlumpf said, according to the Zurich-based newspaper. German
Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  and his Swiss counterpart
“want to wrap up the negotiations in the summer.”  Planned rules on limiting the risks of Switzerland’s
biggest banks,  UBS AG (UBSN)  and  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) , shouldn’t be
watered down, Widmer-Schlumpf told the newspaper.  Switzerland’s capital requirements might be stricter than
in other countries, the minister said, according to
SonntagsZeitung. Still, the Swiss approach to the so-called too-
big-to-fail problem is “transparent” and “liberal” compared
with the mix of measures in other countries where banks are
split up or burdened with high levies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
