Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S.
oil company, flared gases at its Joliet refinery in Channahon,
 Illinois , according to a filing with state regulators.  The  filing  to the Illinois Emergency Management Agency said
malfunctioning equipment caused the flaring, which began at 2:45
a.m. yesterday and ended three minutes later.  Refinery outages can increase prices for refined products
as refiners turn to spot markets to help them meet supply
contracts. Operational disruptions can also depress prices for
crude oil because less feedstock is needed.  The refinery has a processing capacity of 248,000 barrels a
day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
