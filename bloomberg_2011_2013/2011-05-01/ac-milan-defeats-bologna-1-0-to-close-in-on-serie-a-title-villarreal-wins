AC Milan needs one more point to seal
its first Italian soccer league title in seven years after a 1-0
home win over 10-man Bologna.  Mathieu Flamini’s eighth-minute goal at the San Siro
yesterday was enough to move Milan up to 77 points, eight ahead
of defending champion Inter Milan with a superior head-to-head
record. There are three rounds of games left.  “It’s great to know that it’s enough to get one point in
the next three matches to win the championship,” AC Milan Chief
Executive Officer Adriano Galliani told his club’s website.
“We’re very close, but just not there yet.”  Bologna’s Francesco Della Rocca was red-carded for a foul
in the 82nd minute. Inter rallied to win 2-1 at Cesena two days
ago as Giampaolo Pazzini scored twice in injury time.  In  Spain , Barcelona and Real  Madrid  both lost three days
after their Champions League semifinal opener. Diego Ifran and
Xabi Prieto scored in the second half for Real Sociedad in a 2-1
win over Barca. Angel Lafita scored twice in Real Zaragoza’s 3-2
victory at Real Madrid.  Barcelona has 88 points, eight ahead of Real. The second
match of their Champions League semifinal takes place tomorrow,
with Barcelona 2-0 ahead after last week’s game in Madrid.  Villarreal yesterday kept up the pressure on third-place
Valencia with a 2-1 home win over Getafe. Valencia, which lost
1-0 at Osasuna last night, has 63 points with Villarreal on 60.  Dortmund Takes Title  Borussia Dortmund  two days ago won its first German
Bundesliga title in nine years after beating Nuremberg 2-0.  The victory, combined with Bayer Leverkusen’s 2-0 loss at
Cologne, gave Dortmund an unbeatable eight-point lead with two
games remaining.  In  France , Marseille lost ground with a 1-1 home draw
against Auxerre. Lille, a 5-0 winner over Arles-Avignon two days
ago, has 63 points atop the standings, with previous leader
Marseille on 62.  In the  Netherlands , defending champion  FC Twente  leads by a
point with the league title to be decided in the final round.  Twente beat Willem II 4-0, Ajax won 2-1 at Heerenveen and
 PSV Eindhoven  had a 2-1 home victory over  Vitesse Arnhem . Twente
has 71 points, Ajax 70 and PSV 68.  WEEKEND RESULTS
