Australia ’s dollar erased gains after
nearing $1.10 for the first time since exchange controls were
lifted in 1983. New Zealand’s dollar also weakened.  The Australian dollar dropped against 15 of its 16 major
counterparts on speculation the  Reserve Bank  of Australia will
keep  interest rates  unchanged tomorrow. The New Zealand dollar
fell against the dollar after the 14-day relative strength index
for the pair rose above 70 last week, a threshold that some
traders see as a sign an asset is poised to reverse course.  “The Aussie is falling after failing to rise above $1.100,
a key level where a lot of buying and selling are likely to
occur,” said Takuya Kawabata, a researcher in  Tokyo  at
Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., a unit of Japan’s largest
foreign-exchange margin company. “I think it’s too early for
the RBA to raise rates again, and I’d like to pay attention to
its statement tomorrow.”  The so-called Aussie fell to $1.0945 as of 9:32 a.m. in
Sydney from $1.0971 in New York on April 29. It earlier reached
$1.0994. New Zealand’s dollar slid 0.4 percent to 80.68 U.S.
cents.  Editors: Nate Hosoda, Nicholas Reynolds  To contact the reporter on this story:
