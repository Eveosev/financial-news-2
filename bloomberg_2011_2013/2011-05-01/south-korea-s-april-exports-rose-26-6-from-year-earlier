South Korea ’s exports climbed to a
record in April as exporters weathered the won’s gains, adding
pressure on the central bank to boost borrowing costs next week
to rein in consumer prices.  Exports climbed 26.6 percent from a year earlier to a
record $49.77 billion, the Ministry of  Knowledge Economy  said
yesterday. This compares with a revised 28.9 percent gain in
March and the median estimate of a 23.7 percent increase in a
Bloomberg News survey of 13 economists.  South Korea’s won has advanced to the highest levels since
2008, reaching 1,070.5 per dollar on April 29, as the nation
reported accelerating economic growth. Deputy Finance Minister
Choi Jong Ku said last week that it’s the government’s job to
reduce exchange-rate volatility, adding that gains in the
currency are partly from “speculative” trading.  “Exports are surprisingly strong and I’m more confident
now that the central bank will raise the interest rate again
next week,” said Kong Dong Rak, a fixed-income analyst at
Taurus Investment & Securities Co. in Seoul. “A strengthening
won and the earthquake in  Japan  have not hurt local exporters
much yet.”  The won advanced 3.6 percent in the past month, the best
performer among the 10 most actively traded currencies in  Asia 
excluding Japan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Best-Performing Currency  Gains in the currency are helping to curb inflation that
exceeded the central bank’s 4 percent target ceiling in each of
the first three months of the year. Consumer prices rose 4.6
percent last month, according to the median forecast of 13
economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. The data is scheduled to
be released at 8 a.m. today in Gwacheon, south of Seoul.  Bank of Korea Governor Kim Choong Soo and his policy board
will discuss May 13 whether to raise the benchmark seven-day
repurchase rate after boosting it by a quarter of a percentage
point each in January and March to 3 percent.  Exports, equivalent to about half the gross domestic
product, helped the economy expand last year by the most since
2002 and boosted earnings at companies including  Hyundai Motor
Co. (005380) , South Korea’s largest carmaker.  Exports rose from a revised $48.07 billion in March,
yesterday’s report showed. Imports climbed 23.7 percent to
$43.95 billion. The  trade surplus  was $5.82 billion.  Shipments to Japan jumped 70.1 percent from a year earlier
in the first 20 days of April, driven by oil products, steel,
and mobile phones, the ministry said. Imports from the
earthquake-stricken country rose 3.1 percent over the 20 days
after an 8.4 percent gain in March. Imports of Japanese cars and
semiconductor equipment fell 62.8 percent and 24.6 percent
respectively.  Shipments to  China , the biggest buyer of South Korean
goods, increased 9.3 percent. Exports to the U.S. climbed 23
percent. Data for exports to individual countries are only
available for the first 20 days of the month.  Exports of semiconductors fell 0.4 percent last month while
oil product exports surged 79.8 percent, the ministry said.
Shipments of vessels and vehicles gained 56.1 percent and 37.9
percent, respectively.  To contact the reporters on this story:
