Silver for immediate delivery dropped
as much as 11 percent to $42.6775 an ounce before trading at
$44.3487 an ounce at 8:14 a.m. in  Singapore .  Gold climbed 0.9 percent to a record $1,577.57 an ounce
before trading at $1,554.65 an ounce.  “We opened up this morning in  New Zealand  exceptionally
well bid across the board,”  Jonathan Barratt , managing director
at Commodity Broking Services Pty, said in a phone interview
from Sydney today. “We got a high in gold and then we got
massive sell orders in the spot market and the price fell
through. When futures opened the market fell again.”  “Those sort of moves may be an indicator of a key reversal,
but it will often take one or two weeks to unfold,” he said.  Silver more than doubled in the past year and reached a
record $49.79 an ounce on April 25, while gold increased 31
percent. Gold bought 35.1 ounces of silver today, 7.5 percent
more than the 32.64 ounces on Friday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
