The  Burkina Faso  Workers Union called
for a 30 percent increase in wages and a reduction in prices of
basic goods, threatening to begin demonstrations unless the
government meets its demands.  “We want an increase in wages and a decrease in the price
of basic goods, which have become very expensive in our
country,” Mamadou Nama, general secretary of the labor union,
said in an e-mailed statement today in Ouagadougou, the capital.
Protests may begin “in the coming days”, he said.  The government will consider workers’ grievances and work
to find a solution, Civil Service, Work and Social Welfare
Minister Soungalo Appolinaire Ouattara told reporters today
after receiving a list of complaints from the union.  About 3,000 people demonstrated in Ouagadougou yesterday
against the rising cost of living and to call for President
Blaise Compaore to resign. The West African country has been
wracked by political instability since February, amid protests
over the death of a student in police custody, and a
presidential guard mutiny that led Compaore to dismiss his
government last month.  Prices rose in Burkina Faso after a four-month political
crisis in neighboring  Ivory Coast  interrupted the flow of
imports. Annual inflation was 1.2 percent in January after
prices fell 0.3 percent in December, according to the latest
data on the website of the eight-member  West African Monetary
Union .  To contact the reporter on this story:
