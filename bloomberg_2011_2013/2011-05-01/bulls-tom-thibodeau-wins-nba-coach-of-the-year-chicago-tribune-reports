Tom Thibodeau will be named the
National Basketball Association Coach of the Year after leading
the  Chicago Bulls  to a league-best 62-20 regular-season record,
the  Chicago Tribune  reported, without saying where it got the
information.  It will be the first time a Bulls coach has won the
accolade since  Phil Jackson  in 1996.  A news conference with the NBA and Bulls has been scheduled
for 3:30 p.m. local time, the Tribune said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
