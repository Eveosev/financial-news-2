Israel ’s 10-year bond fell, pushing
the yield to the highest in almost three weeks, on concern about
regional stability after an accord between Palestinian political
groups and amid heightened violence in Syria.  Hamas, an Islamist group that rules the  Gaza Strip , and
Fatah, which holds sway in the  West Bank , signed a preliminary
accord on April 28 to end their almost four-year divide, form a
unity government and hold elections. Israel in response delayed
tax funds to the Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority until
receiving proof the money won’t go to Hamas. Israel, the U.S.
and the European Union consider Hamas a terrorist group.  “Yields changed direction at the end of the trading day as
more sellers came into the market amid concern over the
geopolitical situation,” Gil Chen, head of the fixed-income
desk at Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv, said by
telephone.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit due January 2020
climbed 2 points to 5.33 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in Tel
Aviv, the highest since April 11. The  Tel Aviv 25 Index (TA-25)  of the
country’s 25 biggest companies lost 1.4 percent, the most since
March 13, to 1,296.03.  The shekel strengthened 0.3 percent 2 to 3.3866 per dollar
on April 29, the highest since July 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
