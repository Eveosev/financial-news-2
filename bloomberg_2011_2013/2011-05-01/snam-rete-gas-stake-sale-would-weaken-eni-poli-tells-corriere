A sale of  Eni SpA (ENI) ’s controlling stake
in  Snam Rete Gas Spa (SRG)  would “weaken” Italy’s biggest energy
company, Chairman Roberto Poli told  Corriere della Sera .  “Any break-up would be an historic mistake,” Poli said in
an interview with the newspaper. “Eni, once separated from its
Italian regulated activities, could be much more easily
integrated in an international competitor,” Poli, who will
leave the company May 5, said in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
