Home buyers in Auckland,  New Zealand ’s
largest city, are returning to the  property market  and beginning
to reduce the volume of unsold houses, according to a survey.  The inventory of homes for sale in Auckland fell 9 percent
to the equivalent of 34.8 weeks of sales in April from 38 weeks
in March, according to figures on  realestate.co.nz , the industry
website. Nationally, inventory rose 1 percent after increasing 9
percent in March.  Greater housing demand may support New Zealand’s economic
recovery after confidence and spending deteriorated following a
devastating earthquake that struck Christchurch, the nation’s
second-largest city, in February. Central bank Governor Alan Bollard last week said housing market turnover was beginning to
increase in many parts of the country.  “Auckland is very much on the boundary of moving from a
buyer’s market to one favoring sellers,” Alastair Helm, chief
executive officer at realestate.co.nz, said a statement on the
website. “The levels of sales reported show that buyers are
certainly back in the market and beginning to clear some of this
high inventory.”  The inventory figures, calculated from unsold stock divided
by three-month average sales, may be overstated because of low
sales during the January vacation period. Inventories will show
a “significant fall” in May, Helm said.  The number of new listings across the country fell 8
percent from March, after seasonal adjustment, according to
today’s report. From a year earlier, listings have fallen for 10
straight months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
