RSA Insurance Group Plc (RSA)  began a search
for Chairman John Napier’s replacement as part of an overhaul of
the company’s board, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, citing a
person with knowledge of the matter it didn’t identify.  The insurer hired headhunter Anna Mann to search for a new
chairman and an unspecified number of non-executive directors,
the London-based newspaper said. An RSA spokesman declined to
comment, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
