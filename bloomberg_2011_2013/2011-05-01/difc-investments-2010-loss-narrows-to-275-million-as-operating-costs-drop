DIFC Investments LLC, a unit of the
Dubai International Financial Centre business park, said its
2010 loss narrowed as writedowns on property declined. The
company will complete the sale of its Smartstream unit in 2011.  The net loss narrowed to $274.7 million from $561.4 million
a year ago, the Dubai government-owned company said in a
 statement  to Nasdaq Dubai today. DIFC Investments rescheduled
interest and principal repayment on two $500 million loans owed
to the Dubai government, it said.  “The loss in 2010 was mainly attributable to the
devaluation of the real-estate portfolio due to the market
conditions,” DIFC Investments Chairman Ahmed Humaid Al Tayer
said in the  statement . The company will execute a “selected
divestment plan and expects further value improvement in various
funds and assets” in 2011, if global markets improve, it said.  DIFC Investments owns and operates office buildings in the
tax-free Dubai International Financial Center, which is home to
the regional offices of banks including  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  Standard
Chartered Plc. (STAN)  and Morgan Stanley & Co. Property prices in Dubai
have fallen about 60 percent from their peak in 2008 as the
global financial crisis hurt business and trade.  DIFC Investments expects to complete the sale of business
software company SmartStream Technologies Group Plc. this year,
it said today. It bought the company in 2007. Income from
investment properties and fees fell 4 percent to $146.3 million,
while sales of goods dropped 8 percent to $656.6 million, it
said.  Rent Falls  The company said in December it would cut rents and
operational costs by as much as 50 percent from January to
encourage companies to expand following the financial crisis.
Occupancy in the center continues to be 95 percent, it said.  DIFC Investments booked a loss on the fair value of
investment properties of $374.3 million in 2010 compared with
$438.6 million a year ago, according to the statement. It had a
gain of $5 million from investments in joint ventures and
associates after a loss of $85.3 million a year ago.  The company, which has about $3 billion of debt, had its
outlook changed to negative by  Standard & Poor’s  in August as
its plan to raise $1 billion from asset-sales by the end of 2011
faces uncertainties. The company also has a $1.25 billion
Islamic bond due in June 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
