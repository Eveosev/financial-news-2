Israel’s benchmark stock index tumbled
the most since March, led by  Perrigo Co. (PRGO) , as Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said an agreement between Hamas and Fatah
should concern the world.  Perrigo, the maker of over-the-counter drugs, dropped the
most since Nov. 30 and  Gazit-Globe Ltd. (GLOB) , a multinational real-
estate investment company, tumbled to the lowest in almost a
month. The  Tel Aviv 25 Index (TA-25)  of the country’s 25 biggest
companies lost 1.7 percent, the most since March 15, to 1,292.55
at 1:48 p.m. in Tel Aviv, bringing the four-day drop to 3.7
percent.  Hamas, an Islamist group that rules the  Gaza Strip , and
Fatah, which holds sway in the  West Bank , signed a preliminary
agreement on April 28 to end their almost four-year divide, form
a unity government and hold elections. The U.S., the European
Union and  Israel  consider Hamas a terrorist group. The agreement
should concern citizens "around the world who aspire to see
peace between us and our Palestinian neighbors," Netanyahu said.  “Geopolitical issues, such as the Hamas-Fatah treaty, the
opening of the Rafah crossing by Egypt and the Syrian unrest are
weighing on the local market,” said Yuval Amiram, head of
institutional sales at Tel Aviv-based IBI-Israel Brokerage &
Investments Ltd.  Syrian Unrest  Egypt plans to open its border crossing with the Gaza
Strip, possibly within the next two weeks, the Foreign Ministry
said last week. In Syria, the death toll from anti-government
protests has climbed as President Bashar al-Assad’s regime
intensified a crackdown on people who defied warnings not to
hold demonstrations.  Perrigo lost 3.3 percent to 303.5 shekels and Gazit-Globe
declined 2.8 percent to 44.81 shekels, the lowest intraday level
since April 6.  Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) , the world’s
largest maker of generic drugs, lost 1 percent to 155.50 shekels
and headed for the lowest close since November 2008.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit government bond
due January 2020 was unchanged at 5.31 percent. The shekel
gained 0.3 percent to 3.3866 per dollar on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
