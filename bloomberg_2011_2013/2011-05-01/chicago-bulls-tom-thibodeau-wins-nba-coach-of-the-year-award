Tom Thibodeau was voted the National
Basketball Association Coach of the Year after leading the
 Chicago  Bulls to a league-best 62-20 record, it’s best mark
since Michael Jordan’s final season with the franchise in 1998.  Thibodeau, 53, is the seventh first-year coach to win the
Red Auerbach Trophy and the fourth Bulls coach to claim the
award. The last was Phil Jackson in 1996, when the Bulls went on
to win the NBA Finals for a fourth time in six years. The other
Chicago winners were Johnny Kerr in 1967 and Dick Motta four
years later.  “This is a well deserved honor,” Bulls General Manager
Gar Forman said in a statement on the team’s website today.
“He’s a terrific teacher, motivator, tactician and communicator.
His work ethic, passion for the game and for our players is
appreciated.”  Thibodeau totaled 475 points, including 76 first-place
votes, from a panel of 119 sportswriters and broadcasters in the
U.S. and  Canada . Doug Collins of the  Philadelphia 76ers  was
second, with 210 points, followed by Gregg Popovich of the  San
Antonio Spurs , with 177.  Thibodeau built a reputation as a defensive-minded coach
during 18 years as an assistant with seven NBA teams prior to
earning his first head coaching position in Chicago. When he
took over the Bulls in June, he said improvements in rebounding
and defense were keys to rebuilding the team.  Defensive Improvements  The Bulls allowed 91.3 points per game this season, the
second-fewest in the league and almost eight points less on
average than they gave up last season. Chicago was also second
in the NBA in rebounds, averaging 44.2 per game.  The Bulls added two-time All-Star Carlos Boozer during the
offseason to team with third-year point guard  Derrick Rose ,
who’s one of the leading contenders for the Most Valuable Player
Award after averaging 25 points and 7.7 assists.  The Bulls had their fourth-best regular season in franchise
history and the best since Jordan’s sixth and last championship
season in Chicago in 1997-98.  This season’s 21-game improvement over last year was
achieved even after Boozer missed 23 games because of injury and
Joakim Noah, who averaged a team-leading 10.4 rebounds, sat out
34 games.  Thibodeau’s 62 wins matches the NBA record for a head coach
is his first year set by Paul Westphal in 1992-93 with the
 Phoenix Suns . Thibodeau is the third rookie coach to enter the
postseason with a No. 1 seeded team, joining Westphal and former
Los Angeles Lakers coach  Jerry West  in 1976-77.  Thibodeau started in the NBA as an assistant with the
expansion Minnesota Timberwolves in 1989. After stints with the
Seattle SuperSonics, San Antonio Spurs and Philadelphia 76ers,
he spent seven years with the  New York Knicks  as an assistant to
Jeff Van Gundy before following him to the  Houston Rockets  in
2003.  Thibodeau became an assistant coach for the  Boston Celtics 
in 2007 and joined the Bulls in June 2010, a month after they
fired Vinny Del Negro following consecutive 41-win seasons.
Thibodeau signed a three-year, $10 million contract, according
to the Chicago Tribune.  To contact the reporter on this story:
