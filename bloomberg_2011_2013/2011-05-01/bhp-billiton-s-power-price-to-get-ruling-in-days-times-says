South Africa’s High Court may rule
within days whether Eskom Holdings Ltd. should disclose terms of
its contracts to supply electricity to  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the
 Sunday Times  reported, citing no one.  Naspers Ltd. (NPN) ’s newspaper unit sued the power company under
freedom of information legislation to disclose details of the
contracts, under which the mining company’s southern African
aluminum smelters are supplied with power at a discounted rate.  BHP Billiton  opposed the action, saying disclosure would
give its competitors price-sensitive information, the newspaper
said, citing court documents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
