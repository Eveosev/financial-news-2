CVC Capital Partners Ltd. and Warburg
Pincus LLC are among the bidders for a controlling stake worth
about $750 million in Environmental Resources Management Ltd.,
the Sunday Times reported without saying where it got the
information.  Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. hired Goldman Sachs Inc. earlier
this year to sell its 57 percent stake in ERM and later this
month the bank will release an information memorandum to
potential buyers, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
