Daily Mail & General Trust Plc (DMGO)  will
close its final-salary  pension plan  to existing members in order
to cut costs and reduce  investment risk , the  Observer  reported,
citing Geoffrey Staines, the DMGT pension director.  Entitlements of members before April 1 are unaffected by
the change, though current employees will have to sign up to a
new plan that combines defined benefits and contributions, the
London-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
