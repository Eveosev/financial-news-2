Brazilian bank  Itau Unibanco Holding
SA (ITUB4)  was ordered by a  Sao Paulo  state court to pay 167,700 reais
($103,800) to an unidentified person who lost money in Bernard Madoff’s Ponzi scheme,  Folha de S.Paulo  reported.  A representative of Itau’s BankBoston unit advised the
person to put money in the Fairfield Sentry Fund, which invested
with Madoff, Folha said, citing the person’s lawyer, Paulo Iasz
de Morais. Morais probably will appeal for higher damages, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said.  Itau declined to comment, Folha said. Paulo Marinho, a
spokesman for Itau, declined to comment when contacted by
Bloomberg News by telephone today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
