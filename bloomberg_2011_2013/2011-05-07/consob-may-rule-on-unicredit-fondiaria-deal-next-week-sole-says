Italian regulators may address
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) ’s purchase of a stake in insurer  Fondiaria-Sai SpA (FSA) 
ahead of Fondiaria’s board meeting next week, Il Sole 24 Ore
reported.  The market regulator, Consob, may rule by May 10 on whether
UniCredit must bid for the rest of Fondiaria’s shares, the
newspaper said, without saying where it got the information.
Fondiaria’s board is scheduled to approve its quarterly results
on May 11.  Italy’s biggest bank agreed on March 22 to acquire a 6.6
percent stake in Fondiaria, paying about 170 million euros
($243.4 million) for  Premafin Finanziaria SpA (PF) ’s rights in
Fondiaria’s planned share sale of as much as 450 million euros.
The agreement was conditional on Consob not requiring a
mandatory bid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
