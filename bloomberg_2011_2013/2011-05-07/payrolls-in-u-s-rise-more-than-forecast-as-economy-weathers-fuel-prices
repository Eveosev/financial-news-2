American employers added more jobs
than forecast in April and previous monthly gains this year were
revised up, easing concern the economy is cooling.  Payrolls expanded by 244,000 last month, the biggest gain
since May 2010, after a revised 221,000 increase the prior
month, the Labor Department said yesterday in Washington. The
jobless rate climbed to 9 percent, the first increase since
November, a separate survey of households showed. Employment was
forecast to grow by 185,000 last month, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Stocks and the dollar rallied as the report indicated
consumers in the world’s largest economy are weathering the
highest gasoline prices in almost three years. The figures
bolster Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s forecast for
a labor market that is “improving gradually.”  “The recovery looks to be certainly more self-
sustaining,” said  Omair Sharif , a U.S. economist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , who forecast a 240,000
gain in payrolls. “Businesses have more confidence in the
sustainability of the recovery.”  March payrolls were revised up from a previously reported
gain of 216,000, and February employment increased 235,000, up
from a prior estimate of 194,000.  April payroll projections in the Bloomberg survey of 86
economists ranged from gains of 118,000 to 325,000, while the
jobless rate was forecast to hold at 8.8 percent.  Stocks, Dollar  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent to
1,340.2 at the 4 p.m. close in New York.
IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, used to track the
dollar against the currencies of trading partners including the
euro and yen, rose 0.8 percent to 74.785.  The economy has generated 760,000 private jobs in the past
three months, the employment report showed. Overall, companies
added 2.1 million jobs since February 2010, after the loss of
8.8 million as a result of the 18-month recession that ended in
June 2009.  Private hiring, which excludes government agencies, rose by
268,000 in April, more than the 200,000 median forecast in the
Bloomberg survey and the most since February 2006.  Among companies adding workers is  Norfolk Southern Corp. (NSC) 
The fourth-biggest U.S. railroad is expanding payrolls as it
benefits from higher shipping volumes. First-quarter profit
excluding some items was $1 a share, topping the 90-cent average
estimate from 27 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  More Hiring  “We still have a need for additional employees for the
business that we’ve got out there,” Mark Manion, chief
operating officer of Norfolk Southern, said in an April 27
teleconference. “There is a need to hire for our current
business as well as hiring for the growth that’s anticipated in
the first -- this year and on into 2012.”  A separate survey of households by the Labor Department
showed that the size of the  labor force  was little changed in
April and employment shrank by 190,000. That pushed the share of
the population in the labor force down to 58.4 percent from 58.5
percent a month earlier.  “The labor market has shown further improvement,”
William C. Dudley, president of the  Federal Reserve Bank of New
York , said in a speech yesterday. “Yet the recovery remains
moderate and we still have a considerable way to go to meet the
Fed’s dual mandate of full employment and price stability.”  The payroll figures are a boost for President  Barack Obama ,
whose administration is locked in negotiations with Republican
leaders in Congress to reduce record budget deficits. The
president’s approval ratings got a lift in public opinion polls
after the killing of al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.  Economic Concerns  Americans remained concerned about the economy, which is
likely to be the top issue in the 2012 presidential election. In
a  New York  Times/CBS poll conducted May 2-3, 57 percent of those
surveyed said they approved of the job Obama is doing, up from
46 percent who approved last month. Thirty-four percent approved
of how Obama is handling the economy and 55 percent disapproved.  The jobs report “is obviously good news,” White House
press secretary  Jay Carney  said yesterday aboard Air Force One
as Obama traveled to an event in Indianapolis. “We obviously
have a lot more work to do,” Carney said.  Government payrolls decreased by 24,000 in April, the sixth
straight decline. Local-government employment dropped by 14,000.  Factory payrolls increased by 29,000 last month, exceeding
the survey forecast of a 20,000 gain, after a 22,000 rise in
March.  Plane Demand  “We are going to be hiring and growing employment in Puget
Sound and in  South Carolina  over the foreseeable future,” Jim McNerney, chief executive officer of Chicago-based plane maker
Boeing Co., said on an April 27 teleconference. “Production
rates are fueling really an unprecedented growth for commercial
airplanes.”  Employment at service-providers rose 200,000 in April after
a 184,000 gain the prior month. The health-care industry added
37,300 workers in April. Construction payrolls increased on a
pickup in heavy and civil engineering employment.  Retail trade employment increased by 57,100 last month,
which may have reflected the effects of an Easter holiday that
occurred later this year than last, making seasonal adjustment
difficult for the Labor Department.  While payrolls have grown each month since October,
Bernanke on April 27 said central bankers would like to see more
strength in the U.S. job market and that the recovery has been
“quite slow.”  Bernanke’s View  “The labor market is improving gradually,” Bernanke said
to reporters during the first-ever press conference following a
Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “We would like to make
sure that that is sustainable.”  Fed policy makers last month decided to complete their
program to buy $600 billion in Treasuries through June to boost
the economy. At the same time, Bernanke said the Fed would
maintain record monetary stimulus and keep its balance sheet
steady by reinvesting proceeds of maturing securities.  Economic growth slowed to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first quarter after expanding at a 3.1 percent pace in the last
three months of 2010, according to Commerce Department figures.  Rising fuel and grocery bills are damping  consumer
confidence  and squeezing the budgets of households, whose
spending makes up 70 percent of the world’s largest economy. The
Bloomberg Consumer Comfort Index decreased to minus 46.2 in the
week ended May 1, the lowest level since the end of March, from
minus 45.1 the prior period.  Fuel Costs  Regular gasoline was $3.98 a gallon on May 5, up from $3.07
at the beginning of the year, according to AAA, the nation’s
biggest motoring organization. Food costs rose 0.8 percent in
March, the most since July 2008, consumer-price index data from
the Labor Department showed last month.  Higher incomes are helping make up for the price increases.
Average hourly earnings climbed by 3 cents to $22.95 in April,
yesterday’s report showed, while the average work week for all
employees held at 34.3 hours.  The data also showed a decrease in long-term unemployed
Americans. The number of people jobless for 27 weeks or more
fell to 43.4 percent of all job-seekers from 45.5 percent a
month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
