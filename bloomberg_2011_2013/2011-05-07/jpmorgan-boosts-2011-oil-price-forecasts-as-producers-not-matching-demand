JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  raised its oil-
price forecasts because OPEC and other producers aren’t matching
rising demand and consumers will take time to react to higher
prices.  The bank boosted its 2011  Brent crude  forecast to $120 a
barrel from $110, and changed its estimate for West Texas
Intermediate crude to $109.50 from $99. Forecasts for 2012
prices were raised to $120 and $114, respectively.  “While financial bushfires or perhaps a rapid resolution
to the Libyan civil war could radically alter market dynamics,
the balance of both risks and fundamentals still points to a
supply-constrained world,” JPMorgan analysts led by New York-
based  Lawrence Eagles  wrote in a report yesterday.  Oil futures posted their biggest weekly decline since
December 2008 last week amid concern about the pace of the
economic recovery, with London-traded Brent plunging 13 percent
to $109.13.  JPMorgan forecasts supply to fall short of demand by
600,000 barrels a day during the third quarter, even with the
assumption that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries increases output by 1.2 million barrels a day in
coming months.  The gap could narrow to 300,000 barrels a day by the fourth
quarter, assuming  Saudi Arabia  increases production to 9.5
million barrels a day,  Angola  to 1.7 million and  Iraq  to 3
million, though “that may prove a stretch,” the bank said.
Output from those three OPEC countries in March was 8.66
million, 1.56 million and 2.69 million barrels a day,
respectively, it said.  Supply Gap  Consumers draw on stockpiles when production fails to match
demand. Still, “with inventories already below the five-year
average, any supply gap will have to be balanced by lower demand
growth, rationed by higher prices,” the New York-based bank
said.  Next quarter there’s a risk oil may move toward record
levels near $150 set in 2008, unless there’s a surprise increase
in OPEC output beyond 29.4 million barrels a day or slower
economic growth, the bank said. JPMorgan forecast Brent to
average $130 and WTI $116 during the July-to-September period.  While the bank lowered its estimate of world demand by
100,000 barrels a day, in part because of the earthquake-led
disruptions in  Japan , it raised its forecast for Chinese
consumption, saying data implies  China ’s crude-oil inventories
have been “drawn heavily” in the past six months.  “We have observed a parallel destocking activity in the
copper market,” JPMorgan said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
