British aircraft from the Royal Air
Force bombed a collection of weapons on Friday morning at a
location to the south of Sirte, the home town of Libyan leader
 Muammar Qaddafi , according to the U.K.’s Ministry of Defense.  Two Tornado GR4 planes targeted a cache of 20 FROG-7 rocket
launchers and between 30 and 40 canisters used to transport SCUD
missiles, the ministry said in a statement today. The weapons
“would pose a serious threat to civilians if used against an
urban area,” the ministry said.  Thousands of people have died in more than two months of
Libyan violence, which began with an uprising in the eastern
city of Benghazi. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization has
been enforcing a United Nations-mandated no-fly zone.  “I have no doubt that this stockpile of weapons could have
been used to threaten and kill innocent Libyans,”  Liam Fox , the
U.K.’s Secretary of State for Defense, said in the statement.
“We continue to degrade and destroy a range of military assets
including tanks, armored personnel carriers and rocket launchers
that threaten the civilian population.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
