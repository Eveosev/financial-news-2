Brazil’s efforts to slow inflation
won’t keep the nation’s economy from growing at a
“sustainable” pace, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said.  “We’re managing to calibrate a reduction in demand, a
reduction in credit, a reduction in spending,” Mantega said in
a video interview posted on the  website  of Folha de S.Paulo
newspaper today. “However, it’s not going to bring down the
economy. Investments will continue.”  Brazil’s economic expansion is slowing from last year’s 7.5
percent pace as policy makers raise  interest rates , pare credit
and moderate spending to rein in prices. Mantega said inflation
has reached an “inflection point” after the national
statistics agency reported yesterday that the benchmark annual
rate had reached 6.51 percent in April, above the upper limit of
the government’s target range.  Gross domestic product is expected to grow a
“sustainable” 4.5 percent this year, Mantega said.  “We’re having excellent results from a fiscal point of
view,” he said. “Revenue is good because the economy is
continuing to grow.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
