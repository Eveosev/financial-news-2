AC Milan captured its first Italian
soccer league championship since 2004 following a 0-0 tie at
Roma.  The draw at the Olympic Stadium in  Rome  gives Milan an
unbeatable nine-point lead over archrival  Inter Milan  in Serie
A. Milan has two matches remaining and Inter, which plays
Fiorentina tomorrow, has three.  Milanâ€™s 18th league title ties it with Inter for second-
most in  Italy , nine behind Juventus. Inter had won the past five
Serie A championships.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
