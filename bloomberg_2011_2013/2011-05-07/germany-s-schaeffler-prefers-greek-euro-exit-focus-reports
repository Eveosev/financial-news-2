German Free Democratic Party lawmaker
 Frank Schaeffler  said  Germany  should support any Greek wish to
leave the euro region,  Focus magazine  reported today, citing an
interview with the politician.  Debt restructuring for Greece is “inevitable,” Schaeffler
told Focus. Some 19 lawmakers of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s
coalition are decided to vote against the planned European
Stability Mechanism, or ESM, the magazine also said in the e-
mailed preview of a report to be published May 9. At least
another 36 members of parliament are also considering refusing
approval for the ESM, Focus said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
