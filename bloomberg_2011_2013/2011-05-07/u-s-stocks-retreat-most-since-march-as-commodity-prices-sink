U.S. stocks fell this week, sending
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to the biggest drop since March,
as the largest commodities slump in two years drove down energy
and raw-materials producers as well as  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)   The S&P 500 pared its weekly loss yesterday, gaining 0.4
percent after April job growth topped economists’ estimates.
 Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  and  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  sank 6 percent, leading
declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average , as the price of
oil tumbled the most since 2008. Caterpillar, the world’s
largest maker of construction equipment, fell 4.4 percent.
 Computer Sciences Corp. (CSC)  dropped 15 percent, the most in the S&P
500, after saying full-year profit probably missed its forecast.  The S&P 500 lost 1.7 percent to 1,340.20 this week,
including four straight declines. The Dow fell 171.80 points, or
1.3 percent, to 12,638.74. The S&P GSCI Index of 24 commodities
such as oil and silver sank 11 percent, the most since December
2008, after the U.S. killed  Osama bin Laden  in  Pakistan .  “We’re in a more volatile period for markets as investors
await the end of the Fed’s easy monetary policy, while they
digest data to determine how slow the recovery is,” said Jason Hsu, chief investment officer of Research Affiliates LLC, which
oversees $75 billion in  Newport Beach ,  California . “The death
of Osama bin Laden removed some of the terror-risk premium that
investors have put on global commodities, helping push energy
prices down.”  Silver, Oil, Cotton  The S&P 500 pared this year’s gain to 6.6 percent. Selling
swept commodities markets as investors sold positions following
gains of more than 23 percent in 2011 through April 29 by
silver, oil, gasoline, coffee and cotton. The  S&P 500  had closed
at the highest level since June 2008 on April 29. This year’s
gains have been helped by earnings-per-share that beat estimates
at 72 percent of the 417 S&P 500 companies that reported results
since April 11, Bloomberg data show.  Oil futures retreated 15 percent to a seven-week low of
$97.18 a barrel in  New York  after the death of al-Qaeda leader
bin Laden, a worse-than-estimated report on U.S. service
industries and growing American inventories. Silver contracts
retreated 27 percent, the biggest weekly slump since at least
1975, after CME Group Inc. increased margin requirements, making
it more expensive for speculators to trade.  Energy stocks in the S&P 500 sank 7 percent, the biggest
loss among 10 industries and the largest retreat for the group
since May 2010. Metal, chemical and agricultural commodity
companies slumped 3.8 percent.  Biggest Company  Exxon, the world’s largest company by market value, slumped
6 percent to $82.69 for the biggest retreat in the 30-stock Dow.
Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, lost 6 percent to
$102.88.  Energy companies accounted for 8 of the 10 biggest declines
in the S&P 500.  Pioneer Natural Resources Co. (PXD)  plunged 13 percent
to $89.08. Helmerich & Payne Inc., a drilling contractor,
tumbled 13 percent to $57.67.  Caterpillar slumped 4.4 percent to $110.34. The stock had
risen 23 percent between Dec. 31 and April 29 for the largest
gain in the Dow. DuPont Co., a chemical maker, slumped 3.8
percent to $54.63 this week.  General Electric Co. (GE) , the world’s
largest maker of jet engines, turbines for  power plants , medical
imaging and locomotives, slipped 2.2 percent to $20.01.  Computer Sciences fell 15 percent to $43.51. The provider
of computer services to companies and U.S. government agencies
said sales and profit for the fiscal year that ended March 30
probably missed its forecast.  Stocks gained yesterday, breaking the S&P 500’s four-day
losing streak, after the Labor Department said the U.S. added
244,000 non-farm workers last month, the biggest gain in a year
and more than the 185,000 median economist forecast in a
Bloomberg survey.  Novellus Systems Inc. (NVLS)  rallied the most in the S&P 500 this
week, gaining 11 percent to $35.58. Tokyo Electron Ltd. may look
to buy the semiconductor equipment maker after Applied Materials
Inc.’s acquisition of Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates
Inc., analysts at Citigroup Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
