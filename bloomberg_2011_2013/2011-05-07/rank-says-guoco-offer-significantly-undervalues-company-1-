Rank Group Plc (RNK) , the operator of Mecca
Bingo clubs and Grosvenor casinos, said a 150 pence a share
offer from  Guoco Group Ltd. (53)  “significantly undervalues” the
company.  The offer, required after Guoco boosted its shareholding in
Rank to 41 percent, represents a 0.8 percent premium to
yesterday’s closing price of 148.8 pence, Maidenhead, England-
based Rank said in a statement late yesterday.  Rank, which has gambling businesses in the U.K., Spain and
Belgium, rose 1.3 percent on Friday, valuing the company at 581
million pounds ($951 million.)  “The Guoco Group stated that it looks forward to
continuing its existing relationship with Rank,” according to
the U.K. company’s statement.  Guoco, a Hong Kong investment group, made the bid after
subsidiary All Global Investments Ltd. bought the 12 percent
stake in Rank held by  Genting Bhd (GENT) , Guoco said in a statement on
May 6. Genting is a Malaysian holding company with interests in
gaming and entertainment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
