Paintings by Pierre-Auguste Renoir and
Jan Lievens valued at $20 million have boosted takings generated
by the world’s biggest art-and-antiques fair, six weeks after it
closed.  The sales were confirmed to Bloomberg News as galleries
continued to follow expressions of interest from wealthy
collectors at Tefaf, the European Fine Art Fair, in Maastricht,
the Netherlands. About 260 dealers offered artworks with a total
value of more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) at the event.  Business at Tefaf itself, which closed on March 27, was
quieter than last year, dealers said, making after-sales more
important. The event’s organizers don’t disclose total figures,
just attendance figures. Tefaf attracted 73,000 visitors this
year, an increase of 500 on 2010.  “It is not uncommon that the actual deal is done after the
fair,” James Roundell, a director at  London  dealer  Dickinson ,
said in an e-mail. Dickinson sold Renoir’s 1874 painting “Femme
Cueillant des Fleurs,” showing  Claude Monet ’s first wife
Camille Doncieux in a sunlit meadow. The early Impressionist
work was being sold by the  Sterling and Francine Clark Art
Institute , Williamstown,  Massachusetts , with an asking price of
$15 million.  An early-17th-century panel painting of an old man by the
Dutch painter  Lievens  was priced at 3.9 million euros ($5.7
million) on the booth of the Paris-based Old Master dealership,
 Haboldt & Co . The work had been acquired by Bob Haboldt at
 Sotheby’s (BID)  in London in July 2010 for 2.5 million pounds. Both
paintings were bought by European private collectors, said
 Tefaf .  Quinn Show  The British contemporary artist  Ged Quinn  is a name that
investment-minded collectors are watching.  Five new large-scale works by the Cornwall-based artist are
included in a show at the  Stephen Friedman Gallery  in Mayfair,
London, through June 1. The paintings, which insert 21st-century
urban detritus into meticulously rendered Old Master-style rural
scenes, are priced at about 100,000 pounds ($164,230). Smaller
paintings are tagged at 30,000 pounds.  In February, one of Quinn’s tongue-in-cheek Arcadian
landscapes sold at Christie’s International for a record 193,250
pounds, more than three times its estimate.  Quinn, a former protege of  Charles Saatchi , was previously
represented in London by the east London dealership  Wilkinson ,
which priced his paintings at about 60,000 pounds, said dealers.  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
