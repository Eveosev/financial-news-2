The  Boston  Bruins completed a four-
game sweep of the Philadelphia Flyers to advance to the Eastern
Conference finals in the National Hockey League playoffs, while
the  Detroit Red Wings  defeated the  San Jose Sharks  to avoid
elimination in the Western Conference.  The Bruins defeated the Flyers 5-1 in the fourth game of
their best-of-seven series and will face the Tampa Bay Lightning
for a spot in the Stanley Cup finals. The Lightning took their
series 4-0 against the Washington Capitals.  Johnny Boychuk snapped a 1-1 tie early in the third period,
and the Bruins then added goals by Milan Lucic, Brad Marchand
and Daniel Paille. Lucic had started the scoring in the first
period, and the Flyers’  Kris Versteeg  tied the score in the
second period at TD Garden in Boston.  At Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Darren Helm scored with 87
seconds left in the third period to snap a 3-3 tie for the Red
Wings, who trail 3-1 in the best-of-seven series.  Todd Bertuzzi had a goal and Nicklas Lidstrom scored twice
during the first period as Detroit took a 3-0 lead. Logan Couture, Dan Boyle and Dany Heatley scored for the Sharks, who
host Game 5 tomorrow.  In today’s game, the host Vancouver Canucks can eliminate
the Nashville Predators with a win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
