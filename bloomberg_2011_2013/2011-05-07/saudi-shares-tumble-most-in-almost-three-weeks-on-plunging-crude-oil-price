Saudi Arabian shares dropped the most
in almost seven weeks after crude oil capped its biggest weekly
decline in more than two years, following the death of Osama bin Laden and a strengthening dollar.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s biggest
petrochemicals maker, dropped for a third day.  Al Rajhi bank (RJHI) ,
the kingdom’s largest publicly-traded lender by market value,
declined to the lowest level in two weeks.  The 146-member  Tadawul All Share Index (SASEIDX)  declined 1.6
percent, the measure’s largest loss since March 15, to 6,577.74
at the 3:30 p.m. close in Riyadh. Three shares dropped for every
one stock that gained. The volume of shares traded on Tadawul
was 281.8 million, the highest level since March 26.  “The market is under pressure due to sharp declines in
international oil markets,” said Fuad Aghabi, investment
director at Ajeej Capital in Riyadh.  Crude oil tumbled 15 percent from $113.93 a barrel on April
29, the highest settlement price since 2008, after the al-Qaeda
leader’s death. Crude for June delivery fell 2.6 percent
yesterday to $97.18 a barrel in New York, the lowest level since
March 15.  Saudi Arabia  holds one-fifth of the world’s proven oil
reserves.  Sabic declined 2.9 percent to 108.50 riyals. The Riyadh-
based company was downgraded to “hold” from “strong buy” at
Global Investment House KSCC, with a share-price estimate of
120.1 riyals.  Al Rajhi  lost 1.3 percent to 74.75 riyals.  National
Industrialization Co. (NIC)  plunged 3.4 percent, the biggest loss
since March 1, to 37.30 riyals.  Saudi Arabia’s stock exchange is the only Gulf Arab bourse
open on Saturdays.  The Saudi market may rebound on prospects for stronger
economic growth, Aghabi said. U.S. payrolls increased by 244,000
workers last month, the biggest gain since May 2010, after a
revised 221,000 gain the prior month, the Labor Department said
in Washington yesterday.  “Continued global economic growth will reflect positively
on Saudi companies, specifically export-oriented companies such
as petrochemicals, in the medium term,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
