Plum Pretty, trained by  Bob Baffert ,
held off a late charge along the rail by St. John’s River to win
by a neck in the 137th running of the $1 million Kentucky Oaks
at Churchill Downs in Louisville, Kentucky.  The 3-year-old filly, owned by Peachtree Stable and ridden
by Martin Garcia, came into the Oaks off a 25-length victory in
the $200,000 Sunland Park Oaks on March 27 in Sunland Park,  New
Mexico .  “That was awesome,” Baffert said today. “We hoped she’d
run like that. She thought she was at Sunland Park.”  Baffert now has the opportunity to become the first trainer
since Ben Jones in 1952 to sweep the Oaks and the $2 million
 Kentucky  Derby tomorrow with Midnight Interlude.  Plum Pretty earned $570,400 for covering the 1 1/8 miles in
1 minute, 49.50 seconds.  Plum Pretty paid $14.60 to win, $7 to place and $4.60 to
show on a $2 bet. St. John’s River returned $13.20 and $7.20,
while Zazu paid $4 to show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
