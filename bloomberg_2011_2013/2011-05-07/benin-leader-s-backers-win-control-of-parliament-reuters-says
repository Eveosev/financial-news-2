Benin President Thomas  Boni Yayi ’s
party won 41 of 83 parliamentary seats contested in last month’s
elections, while parties allied to him won another 11, Reuters
reported, citing provisional results.  The results give Boni Yayi, who won a second term as the
West African nation’s leader two months ago, effective control
over the legislature, the  news agency  said. Opposition parties
previously held 49 parliamentary seats, while the Forces Couris
pour un Benin Emergent, which backs Boni Yayi, had 34.  To contact the reporter on this story:
