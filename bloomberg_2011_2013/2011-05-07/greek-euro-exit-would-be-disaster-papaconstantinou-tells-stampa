Abandoning the euro would be a
disaster for  Greece , Greek Finance Minister  George
Papaconstantinou  told the Italian newspaper  La Stampa  in an
interview.  “Consequences would be catastrophic,” Papaconstantinou
told the newspaper, saying public debt would double, consumers’
purchasing power would be “shattered,” banks would collapse
and the country would fall into a “war-like recession.”  The country will continue implementing its recovery plan,
Papaconstantinou told the newspaper. Should that not be enough,
Greece may ask for intervention from the European Financial
Stability Facility in 2012, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
