The  Mississippi , the nation’s largest
river system, is nearing a record level in  Memphis  as its rising
waters force widespread evacuations, slow waterborne commerce
and threaten riverside oil refineries.  The Memphis river gauge was at 47.12 feet (14.4 meters) at
2 p.m. local time, according to the  National Weather Service .
The record at Memphis is 48.7 feet set in 1937.  The Mississippi drains 41 percent of the continental U.S.
and is the third-largest watershed in the world, according to
the  Army Corps of Engineers . It is a major delivery system for
commodities and petroleum products and the land along its banks
grow wheat, soybeans and other crops. Flooding across the south
has killed at least two people, driven thousands from their
homes and closed a 23-mile stretch of Interstate 40 in Arkansas.  “The rain event we’ve had the past two weeks is 600
percent above normal,” said Major General Michael Walsh,
commander of the Corps’  Mississippi  Valley Division, who has
dispatched “hundreds” of field engineers to fight the rising
water.  Throughout April, the central and southern U.S. was hit
with severe thunderstorms and heavy rains, as well as
destructive tornadoes. The tornado outbreak from April 25 to
April 28 produced an estimated 305 storms, now considered the
most in U.S. history. It also killed at least 327 people,
according to the  National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration .  Tanker Traffic  The rains fell on ground already saturated by last winter’s
melting snow. The water volume sparked flooding throughout the
central U.S. on the Ohio, Mississippi and White rivers, breaking
water level records at many locations, said Jeff Graschel,
service coordination hydrologist for the  Lower Mississippi River
Forecast Center  in Slidell,  Louisiana .  “The high water, and consequently the increase in river
currents, will affect tanker traffic for the delivery of crude
oil and the loading of petroleum products,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston. Some refinery
locations may be flooded by the rising water, “causing
reductions in crude processing rates and consequently an impact
in supply,” Lipow said.  The New Orleans-Baton Rouge region has 11 refineries with a
combined capacity of 2.5 million barrels a day, or 13 percent of
U.S. output, Lipow said.  Spillway to Open  The Bonnet Carre spillway near  New Orleans  will be opened
on May 9 to relieve pressure on levees along the Mississippi,
the New Orleans Times-Picayune newspaper reported yesterday.
When opened, the spillway can divert as much as 250,000 cubic
feet of water per second into  Lake Pontchartrain  and away from
downstream communities, the newspaper said.  At Cairo,  Illinois , the Ohio had risen to 61.72 feet,
surpassing the record of 59.5 feet set in 1937, on May 2 when
the U.S.  Army Corps  of Engineers blew up the Birds Point Levee
in  Missouri . The breach allowed the water to spill over a
130,000-acre rural area in a bid to prevent the destruction of
the town.  The river rose at the rate of a foot a day for the past two
days at Memphis, where  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  operates a 195,000
barrel-a-day refinery. The city closed flood-wall doors, while
some barge traffic remains, said Major Jon Korneliussen of the
 Corps of Engineers .  Order to Leave  “There has been no material impact to production at
Memphis or St. Charles due to flooding,”  Bill Day , a Valero
spokesman, said yesterday in an e-mail. The St. Charles refinery
is located on the Mississippi in Louisiana.  Memphis police began delivering voluntary evacuation
notices to  2,000 homes yesterday , said George Little, chief
administrative officer for the city.  Little said the order was based on a flood crest of 48
feet. However, officials believe the river may rise to 49 feet,
setting a record, which will mean more people may be urged to
leave their homes, he said. The river is expected to crest there
on May 12.  “This is unprecedented in this area by all accounts,”
Little said by telephone. Much of the city of about 670,000 is
on high ground and isn’t in danger of being inundated, he said.  The Coast Guard closed a portion of the Mississippi because
of the imminent danger of vessel wakes topping a flood wall in
Caruthersville, Missouri, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Bill
Colclough.  10-Lane Highway  The volume of water in the Mississippi more than doubles
after it takes in the flow from the  Ohio . Graschel likened the
Mississippi to a four-lane highway that joins a six-lane Ohio.  “It’s a 10-lane highway from Cairo southward,” Graschel
said.  Shipments on the Ohio have also been disrupted. “Both our
docks are under water for the first time since we went into
business in the early 1970s,” said Ken Canter, executive
director of the  Paducah-McCracken County Riverport Authority  in
 Kentucky , which loads and unloads barges. Full operations are 10
to 12 days away, Canter said.  Another Mississippi tributary, the White River, is at 39.32
feet in Des Arc, Arkansas, today, breaking a record set in 1949,
according to the  National Weather Service . The previous record
was 37.3 feet, the agency said.  The rising water on the White River shut a 23-mile stretch
of I-40, the third-longest highway  in the system , running from
 California  to  North Carolina .  “That is first time in the history that highway has been
closed,” said Tommy Jackson, spokesman for the  Arkansas
Department of Emergency Management  in  Little Rock . “That is a
major trucking corridor between Little Rock and Memphis.”  Jackson said with the Mississippi rising, the White River
has no place to go, so flooding will probably last in  Arkansas 
through next week.  Two people have died and a third is reported missing in
flooding in Arkansas, where at least 1,000 people have been
evacuated, Jackson said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
