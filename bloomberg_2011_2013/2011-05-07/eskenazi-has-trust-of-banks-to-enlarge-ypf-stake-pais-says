Enrique Eskenazi’s Grupo Petersen has
won the “trust” of several worldwide banks for its plan to
increase its stake in the local Argentine unit of  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ,
Eskenazi said in an interview with  El Pais .  The lenders include Brazilian, Mexican and European banks.  Eskenazi’s “operation” to enlarge a stake in oil producer
YPF SA by 10 percent is valued at more than 800 million euros,
($1.1 billion), the Argentine investor said, according to the
newspaper. “We have the absolute confidence of Repsol,” he was
quoted as saying by El Pais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
