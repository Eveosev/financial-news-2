Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  expects to flare
gases at its Corpus Christi West refinery in  Texas  until 8 p.m.
local time tomorrow as a oleflex unit is restarted, according to
a  filing  with state regulators.  The flaring began today at 8 a.m.  The oleflex unit converts isobutene into isobutylene in the
process of creating gasoline blending components.  Valeroâ€™s Corpus Christi West plant can process 200,000
barrels a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
