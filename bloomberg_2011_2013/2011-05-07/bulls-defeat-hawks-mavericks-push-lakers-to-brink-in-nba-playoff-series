Derrick Rose  scored a career-high 44
points and the Chicago Bulls defeated the Atlanta Hawks 99-82,
while the Dallas Mavericks beat the defending champion  Los
Angeles  Lakers 98-92 to move within one game of sweeping their
series.  The Bulls took a 2-1 lead against the Hawks in the Eastern
Conference semifinals. The Mavericks lead the Lakers three games
to none in their best-of-seven Western Conference semifinal
series.  Rose made 16 of 27 shots from the field, including four 3-
pointers, and tallied seven assists and five rebounds at Philips
Arena in Atlanta.  “Just attacking the whole game,” Rose told reporters.
“That was my whole thought process.”  Jeff Teague, with 21 points, was high scorer for the Hawks,
who host Game 4 tomorrow.  “He’s tough to cover anyway, but when his jump shot is
falling, he’s the MVP,” Teague said.  At American Airlines Center in Dallas,  Dirk Nowitzki  scored
32 points and Jason Terry added 23 for the Mavericks, who can
sweep the Lakers with a home court win tomorrow.  Andrew Bynum had 21 points and 10 rebounds and Lamar Odom
scored 18 for the Lakers.  Kobe Bryant  had 17 points for Los
Angeles.  In tonight’s games, the Oklahoma City Thunder are at the
Memphis Grizzlies with the teams looking to break a 1-1 tie in
their series, while the Miami Heat can take a 3-0 series
advantage with a win in  Boston  against the Celtics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
