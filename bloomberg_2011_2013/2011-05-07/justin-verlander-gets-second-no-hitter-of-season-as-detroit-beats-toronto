Justin Verlander said his second
career no-hitter felt “just as good as the first” after the
Detroit Tigers righthander allowed just one baserunner on an
eighth-inning walk in a 9-0 win over the  Toronto Blue Jays .  Verlander (3-3) yesterday became the 28th pitcher in major
league history to register two no-hit games as he threw the
second no-hit game of the Major League Baseball season.  Francisco Liriano of the  Minnesota Twins  recorded the
season’s first no-hitter five days ago, against the Chicago
White Sox. Verlander’s first no-hitter came against the
 Milwaukee Brewers  on June 12, 2007.  “I felt like tonight I had really good control of my
fastball, and I just used that to my advantage,” Verlander, 28,
told reporters at Rogers Centre in Toronto. He threw 74 of 108
pitches for strikes, and struck out four.  The Tigers (16-18) scored three runs in the third inning
off a walk, wild pitch and groundout. Jhonny Peralta and Alex Avila homered in the fourth to add three more runs.  Victor Martinez  had run-scoring singles in the fifth and
ninth innings and Peralta added an RBI single in the ninth.  “My breaking ball was surprisingly my worst pitch,” the
righthander said. “That’s probably indicative of why I didn’t
have many strikeouts. I was just able to move the ball around
and keep guys off balance and get some quick outs.”  Ricky Romero (2-4) surrendered six runs on five hits in 3
1/3 innings for Toronto (15-18).  To contact the reporter on this story:
