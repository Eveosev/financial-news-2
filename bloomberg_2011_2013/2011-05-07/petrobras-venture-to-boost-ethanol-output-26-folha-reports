Nova Fronteira Bioenergia SA will
produce 107.1 million liters of anhydrous ethanol in the 2011-
2012 harvest, 26 percent more than the previous year,  Folha de
S.Paulo  reported, citing Chief Executive Officer Fabio Venturelli.  The increase is aimed at aiding government efforts to
reduce inflation by keeping gasoline prices from rising, the Sao
Paulo-based newspaper said, without citing anyone.  Nova Fronteira is a venture controlled by Petrobras
Biocombustivel SA and  Sao Martinho SA (SMTO3) , Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
