Nottingham Forest captured the final
spot in the playoffs of English soccer’s Championship by winning
3-0 at Crystal Palace.  Victory in the regular-season finale clinched sixth place
in the second division for Forest and sets up a playoff meeting
with third-place Swansea, which beat Sheffield United 4-0.
Fourth-place Cardiff, which tied Burnley 1-1, will meet Reading,
a 2-1 winner over Derby, in the other matchup.  The winners of the two-match series will then meet for a
place in the Premier League. Joining  England ’s top division is
worth about 90 million pounds ($147 million) in television
rights and other revenue, accountant Deloitte LLP estimates.  QPR and Norwich have already earned automatic promotion
after finishing as the top two in the league. QPR today was
officially crowned champion after the Football Association said
it wouldn’t face a points deduction for rule-breaching charges
connected to the signing of Alejandro Faurlin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
