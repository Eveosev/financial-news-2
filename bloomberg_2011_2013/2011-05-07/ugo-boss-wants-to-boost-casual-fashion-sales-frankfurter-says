Hugo Boss AG (BOS) , the German luxury
clothier, plans to boost sales with casual fashion,  Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung  reported today, citing Chief
Executive Officer Claus-Dietrich Lahrs.  Casual fashion accounts for 40 percent of the companyâ€™s
revenue, the newspaper said in the preview of a report to be
published tomorrow.  Hugo Boss  also wants to sell more tailor-
made suits as it starts making them in Shanghai and Singapore
later this year, Frankfurter said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
