Ireland is set to get a reduction in
the 5.8 percent interest rate on its 85 billion-euro ($121.7
billion) financial bailout, the  British Broadcasting Corp .
reported on its website, citing people it didn’t identify.  The  BBC  said it was “unclear” how much of a rate cut will
be granted on the European Union and International Monetary Fund
aid package.  The bailout will be discussed at a future meeting and
nothing has yet been decided, a spokesman for the Irish Finance
Ministry told Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
