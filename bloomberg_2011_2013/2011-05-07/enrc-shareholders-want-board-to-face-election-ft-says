Shareholders in Eurasian Natural
Resources Corp., a producer of metals in  Kazakhstan , are
demanding that the company board be up for re-election at an
annual meeting next month, the Financial Times said.  The move by owners of about 43 percent of ENRC shares comes
after disagreements over an acquisition by the company in the
Democratic Republic of Congo last year, the FT said without
citing its source.  To contact the reporter on this story:
