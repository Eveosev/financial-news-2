German lawmakers Carsten Schneider and
Wolf Klinz are in favor of a restructuring of  Greece ’s debt,
they told the  Deutschlandfunk , or DLF, radio station in separate
interviews today.  Schneider, budget spokesman of the opposition  Social
Democratic Party  in the Bundestag, and Klinz, a European
Parliament lawmaker for the Free Democratic Party who heads a
committee on the financial crisis, both criticized yesterday’s
unscheduled meeting of EU officials in Luxembourg as it spurred
speculation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
