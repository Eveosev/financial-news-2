Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel beat out
teammate  Mark Webber  to win pole position for tomorrow’s Turkish
Grand Prix.  The defending world champion posted a time of 1 minute.
25.049 seconds in Istanbul to top Webber’s qualifying run of
1:25.454. Vettel has started from pole in all four races this
season, winning the first two.  “I’m very happy,” Vettel said on Red Bull’s website. “I
messed up the car yesterday morning, so we missed the session in
the afternoon, but the guys fixed it today and I think they did
a very good job.”  Mercedes’s  Nico Rosberg  will start third next to McLaren’s
Lewis Hamilton, who won the last race in China on April 17.
Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso, McLaren’s Jensen Button, Renault’s
Vitaly Petrov, Mercedes’s  Michael Schumacher , Renault’s Nick
Heidfeld and Ferrari’s Felipe Massa round out the top 10
