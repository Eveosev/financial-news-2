Gunmen in  Nigeria  attacked villages in
the northern state of Bauchi, killing at least 16 people in a
region shaken by recent sectarian fighting, police said.  Several villages in the Bogoro district were attacked
overnight yesterday and most of the casualties were women and
children, James Apakasanga, Bauchi state police commissioner,
told reporters yesterday. “We have sent a detachment of
soldiers and police to track the attackers,” he said.    Nigeria,  Africa ’s top oil producer and most populous
country of more than 140 million people, is roughly split
between a mainly Muslim north and a predominantly Christian
south. Sectarain fighting flared up in Bauchi last month after
violent protests by mainly Muslim supporters of opposition
candidate,  Muhammadu Buhari , who lost in elections to President
Goodluck Jonathan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
