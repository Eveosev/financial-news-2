Colombian President  Juan Manuel Santos 
said several leaders of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
 Colombia , the nation’s biggest guerrilla group, are sick or
injured and called for the rebels to demobilize.  Santos, who cited intercepted e-mails from the group, known
as the FARC, said a member with the alias of Pablo Catatumbo
suffered a number of fractures after an accident in the jungle.
Romana, also an alias, has back problems that make it difficult
for him to walk, according to a statement on the presidential
 website .  The FARC, which is classified as a terrorist organization
by the U.S. and the European Union, was founded in 1964 as a
rural, Marxist insurgency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
