Ireland faces bankruptcy because of
its acceptance of the European Union-led 85-billion-euro ($121.7
billion) bailout package late last year, Morgan Kelly, an
economics professor, wrote in today’s  Irish Times  newspaper.  “Ireland is facing economic ruin,” wrote Kelly, dubbed
the country’s “Doctor Doom.” By 2014 Ireland well have debt of
around 250 billion euros, Kelly forecasts. “Irish insolvency is
now less a matter of economics than of arithmetic. Marginal
changes in the bailout terms can make no difference.”  Ireland was forced to accept the bailout last November as
concerns over the rising cost of its bank-guarantee plan locked
it out of bond markets. A new government, elected in February,
wants to renegotiate the 5.8 percent interest rate the country
is paying on the aid package.  “National survival requires that Ireland walk away from
the bailout,” Kelly wrote. “This in turn requires the
government to do two things: disengage from the banks and bring
its budget into balance immediately.”  Kelly is a professor of economics at University College
Dublin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
