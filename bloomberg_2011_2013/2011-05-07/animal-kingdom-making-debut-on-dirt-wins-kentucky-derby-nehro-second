Animal Kingdom, running his first race
on dirt, won the $2 million  Kentucky  Derby at Churchill Downs in
Louisville, Kentucky.  Jockey John Velazquez got his first Derby win after losing
his mount on Uncle Mo, that was scratched because of an illness,
and taking over for Robby Albarado who was injured earlier this
week.  Nehro was second and Mucho Macho Man was third.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
