Tata Steel Europe aims to double its
profit margin by concentrating output on higher-value products
and steel more closely tailored to customers’ needs, the
company’s chief executive officer told the Financial Times.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) ’s European unit wants specialized products
including high-strength steel for vehicle bodies to make up 50
percent of sales in a few years, up from 20 percent now, Karl- Ulrich Koehler told the newspaper.  European steel consumption, while rising this year, will
still be 20 percent below levels in 2007, Koehler said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
