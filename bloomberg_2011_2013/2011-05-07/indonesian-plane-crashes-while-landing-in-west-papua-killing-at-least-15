A passenger plane carrying 27 people
crashed in bad weather when it was about to land in the
Indonesian province of West Papua, killing at least 15, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing local officials.  The Chinese-made Xian MA60 twin-turboprop aircraft
belonging to a state-owned airline went down just before landing
in Kaimana, Bambang Ervan, a transportation ministry spokesman,
told AP, adding it was difficult to say if there were any
survivors.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
