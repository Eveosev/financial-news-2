U.K. Business Secretary Vince Cable
called the Conservative party, the Liberal Democrats’ partner in
a coalition government, “ruthless, calculating and thoroughly
tribal” in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.  Cable criticized the “enormous amount of personal abuse”
heaped on Deputy Prime Minister  Nick Clegg , leader of the
Liberal Democrats, during the campaign for local elections and a
referendum for electoral change on May 5.  “That doesn’t mean to say we can’t work with them,” Cable
said in the interview. “You have to be businesslike and
professional, and you have to work with people who aren’t your
natural bedfellows, and that is being grown-up in politics.”  Cable’s comments come after the worst local-election
results for the Liberal Democrats since the party’s formation in
1988. Voters also rejected a new electoral system backed by
Clegg. The Liberal Democrats sought the referendum as part of
negotiations with the Conservatives to form a coalition
government last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
