Australia  and  New Zealand  will contest
rugby union’s annual Bledisloe Cup as a three Test match series
between the two nations from next year.  Australia will host the potentially deciding match in
October 2012 with future third games in the series to be
alternated between the two countries for the next 10 years, the
New Zealand Rugby Union said in an e-mailed statement today.  The plan, which guarantees at least one match in Sydney
every year, will replace the current system where the Bledisloe
Cup is typically decided by the two games played between
Australia and New Zealand in the Tri-Nations tournament that
also includes  South Africa .  Fan research in Australia and New Zealand supported the
Bledisloe Cup being contested over three matches, rather than
two, New Zealand Rugby Union Chief Executive Officer Steve Tew
said in the statement,  The Bledisloe Cup, which has been contested since 1931, has
changed its format a number of times with four games contested
in 2010, three in 2006 and two matches annually between 1999 and
2005 as part of the Tri-Nations, according to the  Australian
Rugby Union ’s website.  The Tri-Nations itself will also change next year,
including a new name and branding, with the addition of
 Argentina  to the competition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
