Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo , Latin America’s largest publicly traded water
utility, rose the most in six weeks after reporting higher-than-
expected earnings.  Sabesp, as the company is known, increased 2.6 percent to
91.23 reais at the close in Sao Paulo, the most since Feb. 4.  The company reported last night adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization of 1.02 billion
reais ($506.6 million) for the fourth quarter, 5 percent higher
than what analysts forecast, according to information compiled
by Bloomberg.  “The company’s results were good and the shares are
probably reflecting this,” and to a lesser extent the rate
hike, Vicente Koki, an analyst at Portuguese lender Caixa Geral
de Depositos SA’s Sao Paulo office, said today in a telephone
interview.  Arsesp, the energy and sanitation regulator for Sao Paulo
state, approved an increase in the rate Sabesp charges for water
of 2.4 percent, up from a proposal of 1.9 percent in November.  The increase in water tariff will start April 22, Agencia
Reguladora de Saneamento e Energia de Sao Paulo, as the
regulator is officially known, said in a statement today. It may
be adjusted in August after Arsesp concludes a study on the
value of the company’s assets.  Sabesp, based in Sao Paulo, is expected to invest 12
billion reais through 2016 to expand infrastructure and boost
efficiency, according to the statement. It delivers water and
treats sewage in 363 cities in the state of Sao Paulo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
