The  European Central Bank  said
banks will repay 1.94 billion euros ($2.5 billion) of three-year
loans next week.  Seven banks will return 1.57 billion euros borrowed in the
first of the so-called Longer Term Refinancing Operations, and
15 will hand back 371 million euros of the second offering, the
Frankfurt-based ECB said in a statement today. That takes the
total amount of money repaid early to 237.7 billion euros, or 23
percent of the overall lending.  The ECB flooded financial markets with three-year loans
totaling more than 1 trillion euros a year ago after banks
stopped lending to each other because of  Europe ’s debt crisis.
Banks now have the option of repaying the loans, which were
offered at the average of the ECB’s  benchmark rate  over their
duration.  The central bank this month cut its forecasts and predicted
the 17-nation euro economy will shrink 0.5 percent this year
before growing 1 percent in 2014. The fact that banks have
started paying back the loans is a “positive sign” of economic
stabilization, ECB Executive Board member Joerg Asmussen said on
March 18.  The central bank still allows banks to borrow as much money
as they want against eligible collateral for periods of one
week, one month and three months. Its monetary policy “will
remain accommodative for as long as needed,” President  Mario Draghi  said this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
