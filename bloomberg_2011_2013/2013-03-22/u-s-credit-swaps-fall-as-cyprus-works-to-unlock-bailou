A gauge of U.S. corporate credit
risk fell as Cyprus said it entered the final stages of talks
with international creditors to receive a rescue package.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, eased 0.7
basis point to a mid-price of 90.6 basis points at 8:48 a.m. in
 New York , according to prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Cypriot lawmakers are debating proposals needed to obtain a
bailout after they rejected a plan by the 17 euro-area finance
ministers to tax bank deposits. The  European Central Bank , which
makes up the troika along with the  International Monetary Fund 
and the European Commission, will cut off emergency funding to
Cyprus’s banks at the end of March 25 unless there is a deal,
threatening to deepen  Europe ’s debt crisis.  The credit-swaps index typically falls as investor
confidence improves and rises as it deteriorates. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
