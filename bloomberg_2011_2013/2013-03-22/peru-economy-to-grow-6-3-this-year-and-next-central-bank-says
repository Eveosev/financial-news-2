Peru’s economy will expand 6.3
percent this year and next, while inflation will end the year at
about 2 percent, the central bank said in a report issued in
 Lima  today.  The bank had said on Dec. 14 that gross domestic product
would rise 6.2 percent in 2013 and 6.3 percent in 2014.
Inflation slowed to 2.5 percent in February from 2.9 percent the
month before.  The central bank will sell $4 billion to the Finance
Ministry this year, Julio Velarde, the bank’s president, told
reporters during the presentation. The bank is not concerned
about capital losses stemming from its program to buy dollars
and doesn’t need more capital, he said.  The bank’s equity has declined after its net loss through
Nov. 30 increased nine-fold to 1.1 billion soles from 121
million soles a year earlier. The monetary authority has
purchased $30 billion since 2009 to ease a rally in the sol
stemming from capital flows into the country. The purchases have
doubled  Peru ’s foreign reserves to $68.4 billion in three years.  After buying dollars, the central bank sells certificates
of deposit to absorb the soles from the market. The bank’s
capital has fallen as it pays higher interest on the
certificates, currently about 3.80 percent, than it earns from
its dollar reserves invested overseas.  The central bank lost 203 million soles in 2011, its first
negative result since 1994.  Capitalizing the central bank will give it leeway to
continue intervening in the foreign exchange market, Finance
Minister Miguel Castilla said March 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
