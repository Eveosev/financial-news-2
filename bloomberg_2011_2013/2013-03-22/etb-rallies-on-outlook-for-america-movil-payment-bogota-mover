Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de
Bogota SA, the city-owned phone company in Colombia’s capital,
gained the most in seven weeks after saying it expects a 180
billion peso ($99 million) payment from America Movil SAB.  ETB gained 4 percent to 413 pesos at 11:59 a.m. in Bogota,
headed to its biggest advance since Feb. 1. The shares were the
best performers on the IGBC index, which gained 0.9 percent.  ETB president Saul Kattan said in an interview on W Radio
that he expects the company to get the payout from America
Movil’s Claro unit after a Colombian court ruled in favor of ETB
in a dispute over connection fees.  Claro “should have paid back that money a long time ago,”
Kattan said on W Radio.  Claro said the court order “at no moment establishes the
amount to be returned” to ETB, making it “not possible to
comply” with the verdict. Claro said in a Colombian  filing  that
it will resort to all legal alternatives to defend its
interests.  To contact the reporter on this story:
