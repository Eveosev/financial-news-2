The following table details the expected annual
year-over-year share-weighted earnings growth for industry groups in the Dow
Jones Stoxx 600 Index.  Percentages are calculated using Bloomberg earnings estimates for the
current period compared with actual figures from a year ago. Companies are then
grouped together by industry and summed for each period to calculate the
percentage growth.  
NM -- The calculations of percentage changes between profit and loss and vice
versa are not meaningful, hence not calculated.  To contact the reporter on this story:
