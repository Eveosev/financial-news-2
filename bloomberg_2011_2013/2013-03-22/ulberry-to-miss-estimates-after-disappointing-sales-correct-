(Corrects typographical error in company name in headline.)  Mulberry Group Plc (MUL) , a British
luxury-handbag maker, said full-year sales and profit will miss
estimates because of weak business in the last 10 weeks.  Pretax profit for the year ending March 31 will be about 26
million pounds ($39.5 million), the company said today in a
statement. That compares with the 30.7 million-pound average
estimate of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue will
be about 165 million pounds, Mulberry said, compared with the
176 million-pound average estimate.  “Trading across the retail portfolio during the last 10
weeks has been disappointing, including a reduction in tourist
spending in the London stores,” Mulberry said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
