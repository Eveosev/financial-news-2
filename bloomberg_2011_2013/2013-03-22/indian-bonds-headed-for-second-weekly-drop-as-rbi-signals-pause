Indian bonds due 2022 fell for a
second week, pushing the yield to the highest level in 2 1/2
months, as the central bank signaled it will refrain from adding
to this year’s two interest-rate cuts.  The  Reserve Bank  of  India  lowered its  repurchase rate  to
7.50 percent from 7.75 percent on March 19, and said room for
further monetary easing was limited by “persisting” inflation.
Demand for the notes slowed amid speculation the government will
offer new 10-year bonds once the next fiscal year starts April
1, said Ganti N. Murthy, head of fixed income at Peerless Funds
Management Co. in Mumbai.  “The RBI has indicated its hands are tied as inflation may
remain stubborn,” said Murthy, who helps manage $866 billion in
assets. “That is keeping yields at elevated levels.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent bonds due June 2022 rose 10
basis points, or 0.10 percentage point, this week to 7.96
percent in Mumbai, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate rose three basis points today and is the
highest since Jan. 3.  Wholesale-price inflation  quickened to 6.84 percent in
February from a year earlier, while  consumer prices  rose 10.91
percent, official data show.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, from a week ago to 7.55
percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate fell
one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
