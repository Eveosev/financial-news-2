Petroleos de Venezuela SA , the
country’s state-owned oil producer, reported a 3 percent decline
in annual sales on lower prices and a divestiture, newspaper El
Universal reported, citing an Oil Ministry report.  Sales fell to $121 billion last year after PDVSA, as the
company is known, sold a refining company in  Germany , the
Caracas-based newspaper said. The average price of the
Venezuelan crude basket slid $3 last year to $103.2, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Cash holdings of the Caracas-based company plunged 51
percent to $4.2 billion, El Universal said. Even so, profit at
South America’s largest oil exporter rose 2.8 percent in 2012,
the newspaper reported, without saying why.  PDVSA’s debt to service providers rose 40 percent to $14.6
billion in 2012, the newspaper reported.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  said
this week it’s reducing work in  Venezuela  because of trouble
getting paid by PDVSA.  Ministry spokeswoman Marlene Tupano said she didn’t have a
copy of the report. PDVSA spokesman Alfredo Carquez in Caracas
didn’t return an e-mail and telephone calls seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
