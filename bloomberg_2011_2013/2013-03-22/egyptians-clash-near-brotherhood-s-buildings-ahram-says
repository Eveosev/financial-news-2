Supporters and opponents of
Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi’s Muslim Brotherhood clashed in
Cairo after anti-government demonstrations.  The two sides threw stones at each other in streets around
the organization’s headquarters in the capital’s Mokattam
district, the state-run website Ahram Gate reported. About 40
people were wounded and buses used by Brotherhood members were
burned, Al Arabiya television reported. Video footage showed a
front line forming between riot police guarding the building and
protesters.  While marching toward the Brotherhood’s headquarters,
demonstrators stormed one of its offices in the El Manial
district, about six kilometers (3.7 miles) away, Ahram Gate
said.  The protests were organized by 21 parties and activist
groups under the slogan “Down with the rule of the Supreme
Guide.” Secularist and youth activists say Mohammed Badie, the
Brotherhood’s top official who’s known as the Supreme Guide, is
running the country behind the scenes.  Mursi is facing mounting criticism and regular protests, as
critics charge him with defending Islamist interests while
failing to revive the economy or combat a crime wave.  -- Editor: Francis Harris  To contact the reporter on this story:
