SouthGobi Resources Ltd. (SGQ) , a
Mongolian coal mining company controlled by Rio Tinto Group,
will restart production at its Ovoot Tolgoi mine as the outlook
for prices improves.  The company plans to produce 3.2 million metric tons of
semi-soft coking coal over the remainder of 2013, Vancouver-
based SouthGobi said yesterday in a statement.  Production at the mine has been halted since the end of
June 2012 after prices and customer purchases declined.
SouthGobi’s relations with Mongolia became strained last year
after Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. launched an ultimately
unsuccessful bid for a stake in the coal producer.  “While a certain amount of volatility remains in the coal
markets, signs of improvement justify this restart of
operations,” SouthGobi said.  SouthGobi, controlled by Rio’s 51 percent-owned unit
 Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd. (TRQ) , fell 0.5 percent to C$2.09 at the
close of trading in Toronto yesterday. The stock has declined 67
percent in the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
