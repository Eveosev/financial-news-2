GSW Immobilien AG (GIB) ,  Germany ’s
fourth-largest residential landlord by market value, said funds
from operations rose 13.4 percent after the company added
apartments and rents in Berlin climbed.  FFO excluding sales, a measure of a property company’s
ability to generate cash, increased to 64.2 million euros ($83
million) or 1.35 euros per share, from 56.6 million euros or
1.44 euros a share a year earlier, the Berlin-based company said
in a statement today. The company had forecast FFO of 61 million 
to 64 million euros. An average of 5 analysts  surveyed by 
Bloomberg  forecast FFO of 1.28 euros a share.  GSW owns 60,000 apartments, mainly in Berlin, and is
benefiting from rising rents as the population in the German
capital grows. The company added 7,000 apartments this year.  The number of households in Berlin rose 13 percent to
almost 2 million in the 10 years through 2011, according to the
latest census. Rents gained about 8 percent in 2012 and 26
percent in the past five years, according to online broker
ImmobilienScout 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
