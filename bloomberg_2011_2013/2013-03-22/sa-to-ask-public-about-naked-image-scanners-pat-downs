The U.S. Transportation Security
Administration, under court order, will start a rulemaking
process on its airport screening machines and full-body pat-
downs, including collecting and analyzing public comments.  The proposed regulation will be posted on a Federal
Register website later today, said  David Castelveter , an agency
spokesman. The TSA isn’t proposing any change to its screening
procedures, he said.  The move comes almost three years after the TSA awarded a
$47.9 million contract to  L-3 Communications Holdings Inc. (LLL)  and
 OSI Systems Inc. (OSIS) ’s Rapiscan unit to develop full-body scanners,
known as advanced-imaging technology.  A U.S. appeals court in 2011 ordered the rulemaking as the
result of a lawsuit filed by the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, a civil liberties group. The group unsuccessfully sought
to suspend the body-scanner program as a violation of the  Fourth
Amendment .  The use of scanning machines has changed since they were
first rolled out in 2008. The TSA has used software privacy
filters to generate a generic stick figures rather than almost-
nude images on screens at the checkpoint.  In January, the agency terminated a $5 million contract
with Rapiscan and said it would remove those machines from
airports after the company said it couldn’t finish writing the
privacy software by a congressionally imposed deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
