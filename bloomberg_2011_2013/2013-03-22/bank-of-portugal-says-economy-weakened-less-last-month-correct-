(Corrects to say drop was smallest in at least a year in
second paragraph.)  Portugal ’s economy probably
weakened less in February than in the previous month, the Bank
of Portugal said.  The bank’s coincident indicator, which combines several
measures of economic activity and confidence levels, dropped 1.4
percent from a year earlier, after declining 1.5 percent in
January, the central bank said today in its monthly report on
the economy. The drop in February is the smallest in at least a
year.  The Lisbon-based central bank’s indicator of  consumer
spending  dropped 3.8 percent in February from a year earlier. In
January, the indicator declined 4.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
