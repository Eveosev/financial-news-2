Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the second-biggest owner
of German homes, said funds from operations fell 5.8 percent in
2012 as it sold apartments and spent more on maintaining those
it kept.  FFO excluding cash, a measure of property company’s ability
to generate cash, dropped to 49 cents a share in 2012 from 52
cents in 2011, the Luxembourg-based company said in a statement
today. That’s in line with its forecast in November.  Gagfah, controlled by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) , owned
145,000 apartments at the end of 2012, compared with 149,000 a
year earlier. Repair and maintenance costs rose 6.9 percent to
81.8 million euros.  The company last year focused on reducing debt and
fulfilling terms of an agreement with the city of Dresden.
Gagfah increased maintenance spending after settling a lawsuit
with Dresden in March that claimed it wasn’t adequately keeping
up its apartments. Gagfah sold homes in part to raise cash as it
faces 3.4 billion euros of debt maturities this year.  Rental income fell to 385.5 million euros in 2012 from
419.6 million euros. Net income was 43.2 million euros, or 22
cents a share, compared with a loss of 16.4 million euros, or 7
cents, a year earlier.  Gagfah rose as much as 6.5 percent in Frankfurt trading and
was up 5.2 percent at 9.48 euros as of 11:31 a.m. The shares
have gained about 60 percent in the past 12 months, while the
FTSE EPRA/NAREIT Index of German property stocks rose about
20percent.  Loan Maturing  The company has signed term sheets for five of six tranches
in its 2.1-billion euro German Residential Funding loan maturing
in August, according to an  analyst presentation  posted today on
its website. The final tranche will likely be a commercial
mortgage-backed security with a weighted average maturity of
seven years, it said.  In February, Gagfah obtained a five-year, 1 billion-euro
loan from Bank of America Corp. to refinance debt maturing in
May. That loan had a 3.85 percent interest rate.  Gagfah said Chief Executive Officer Stephen Charlton will
be replaced by Thomas Zinnoecker after he leaves his post at the
helm of  GSW Immobilien AG (GIB)  on April 15.  “Having resolved the company’s key challenges during the
past 12 months, Stephen Charlton has tendered his resignation,”
Gagfah said in the statement. “We are ready to take the company
to the next level.”  Gagfah is  Germany ’s second-largest homeowner by number of
apartments. Deutsche Annington Immobilien AG is the country’s
largest with about 186,000 homes.  Annual Outlook  FFO per share will grow by 5 percent to 10 percent in 2013,
the company said. As many as 1,900 homes will be sold.  Average rents were little changed at 5.15 euros per square
meter as only a fifth of its homes qualified for rent increases
under government regulations.  “We expect this number to rise to more than 50 percent in
2013, providing us with more flexibility to grow rents across
our portfolio,” the company said.  Vacancies fell to 5 percent from 5.1 percent and that will
probably decline to 4.8 percent in 2013, Charlton said on a call
with analysts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
