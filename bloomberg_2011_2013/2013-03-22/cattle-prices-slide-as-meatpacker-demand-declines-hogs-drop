Cattle futures dropped on signs
that demand for animals is slowing from U.S. processors. Hogs
also slumped.  Meatpackers processed 478,000 head of cattle in the first
four days of this week, down 0.6 percent from the same period a
week earlier, government data show. Wholesale  beef  yesterday,
fell to the lowest since March 4, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show.  “Boxed-beef prices are not moving extremely well, and
these packers have got enough inventory that they can press this
market a little bit and buy cattle on their terms,”  Lane Broadbent , a vice president at KIS Futures Inc. in  Oklahoma
City , said by telephone today.  Cattle futures for June delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$1.21475 a pound at 10:27 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price is down 7.8 percent this year through
yesterday.  Spot  steers  averaged $1.2476 a pound in the first four days
of this week, down 1.4 percent from a year earlier, as weights
climbed 4.4 percent, government data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose 0.1 percent
to $1.4065 a pound in Chicago.  Hog futures for June settlement declined 0.4 percent to
89.175 cents a pound in Chicago. The price climbed 4.5 percent
this year through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
