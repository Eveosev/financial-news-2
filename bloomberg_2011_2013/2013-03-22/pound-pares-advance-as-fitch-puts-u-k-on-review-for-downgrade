The pound pared a gain against the
dollar after Fitch Ratings said it will review the U.K.’s AAA
rating, “indicating a heightened probability of a downgrade.”  The U.K. currency was 0.3 percent higher at $1.5218 as of
5:08 p.m. London time, after earlier strengthening as much as
0.5 percent to $1.5246. Sterling weakened 0.3 percent to 85.30
pence per euro.  Fitch plans to complete its review by the end of April, the
company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
