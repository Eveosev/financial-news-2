BlackRock Inc. (BLK) , the world’s biggest
money manager, plans to exit the business of investing directly
in private-equity deals as it focuses on its fund-of-funds
business.  The move will lead to the departure of Nathan Thorne,
George Bitar and Mandy Puri, former Merrill Lynch & Co. private-
equity managers hired by BlackRock in 2011, said  Brian Beades , a
spokesman for New York-based BlackRock.  “We had a very strong direct private-equity team, but
given our clients are looking to us for other fund-of-fund
solutions, we are going to transition out of the direct PE
business,” Beades said in an e-mail.  In a memo to employees today, the firm said its clients are
increasingly seeking a “solutions-oriented approach” in
private equity through indirect investments as well as co-
investments. BlackRock last year  acquired  the fund-of-funds unit
from Swiss Re Ltd., which invests client money in private-equity
partnerships. That acquisition helped BlackRock double assets in
private-equity funds-of-funds to $15 billion.  BlackRock also said today it hired Andy Stewart from Credit
Suisse AG to co-head its alternatives unit along with Matthew
Botein.  To contact the reporter on this story:
