Corn declined for the first time in
seven days as U.S. farmers prepare to plant the most acres since
the 1930s. Soybeans and wheat also fell.  Corn for May delivery lost as much as 0.7 percent to
$7.2825 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade and was at $7.285
by 9:57 a.m. in  Singapore . Soybeans slid 0.7 percent and wheat
decreased 0.5 percent.  U.S. farmers may plant 97.339 million acres of corn, the
most since 1936, the average estimate of 32 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg shows. Soybean area will climb to the highest ever and
wheat will increase to a four-year high, the survey showed. The
U.S. Department of Agriculture is scheduled to release its
estimates, based on a national survey of growers, on March 28.  “The expectation is certainly for good acreage for row
crops,” said Michael Pitts, a commodity sales director at
National Australia Bank Ltd. “The report on March 28 is going
to be the market driver for the next few weeks.”  World corn production may climb 9 percent in the 2013-2014
crop year, with the U.S. harvest predicted to rise as much as 30
percent, the International Grains Council said yesterday. Global
corn stockpiles may jump 19 percent from a 16-year low expected
at the end of the 2012-2013 crop year, as output rises faster
than consumption, the council said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
