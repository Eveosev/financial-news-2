Portugal ’s Finance Ministry said
the government posted a deficit in the two months through
February after spending rose more than tax revenue.  Based on comparable figures, the deficit of the central
administration and social security agency was 246.9 million
euros ($320.1 million) compared with a surplus of 586 million
euros in the same period of 2012, the Finance Ministry’s budget
office said in a report on its  website .  Spending rose 4.4 percent. Tax revenue increased 0.3
percent, with revenue from indirect taxes declining 6.4 percent
and revenue from direct taxes rising 15.3 percent.  The Portuguese government on March 15 announced wider
targets for its budget deficit as it forecast the economy will
shrink twice as much as previously estimated this year. The
government targets a deficit equivalent to 5.5 percent of gross
domestic product in 2013, 4 percent in 2014 and below the
European Union’s 3 percent limit in 2015, when it aims for a 2.5
percent gap.  EU officials last year already gave the country more time
to narrow its budget gap after tax revenue missed forecasts.
Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar on Oct. 3 announced an
“enormous” increase in taxes and the government also plans to
cut spending by about 4 billion euros in the three years through
2015.  The shortfall as measured for the European Union’s
excessive deficit procedure may have been equivalent to 6.6
percent of GDP in 2012 due to one-time items and the view of the
EU’s statistics office that revenue from the sale of airport
operator ANA-Aeroportos de Portugal SA can’t be used to
calculate the gap, Finance Minister Vitor Gaspar said on March
15. The 2012 deficit was 4.9 percent according to the
measurement used in the bailout program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
