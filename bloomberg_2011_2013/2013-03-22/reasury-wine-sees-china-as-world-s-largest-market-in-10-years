Treasury Wine Estates Ltd. (TWE) , the
world’s second-largest wine company, expects  China  to overtake
the U.S. by 2023 as the biggest wine market globally.  Chinese wine sales will rise to about 500 million cases a
year in a decade, from 150 million cases at present, Chief
Executive Officer David Dearie said in an interview in Beijing
today, citing company estimates. That will put China ahead of
the U.S., which will sell about 450 million cases, he said.  Treasury, whose brands include Penfolds and Rosemount, is
hoping to boost sales to about 60 cities in China within five
years from less than 16 at present as it tries to capitalize in
Asia, its fastest-growing and highest-margin market. Revenue at
the Melbourne-based company’s Asian unit rose about 10 percent
for the six months ended December from a year earlier, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Where the track record has been in terms of growth for
the last two or three years has definitely been in  Asia ,” Paul
Rayner, Treasury’s Chairman, said in the interview. “There’s a
huge opportunity for us to take market share with premium
wines.”  The Melbourne-based company’s board is visiting China.  Treasury has  gained  46 percent in the past 12 months on
speculation a long-term global glut in wine will turn to a
deficit because of growing demand, bad harvests and as some
producers cut output. The stock closed 0.7 percent lower at
A$6.05 in Sydney trading today.  Satisfying Demand  Treasury hasn’t been affected by a frugality drive by the
government of President Xi Jinping even though about 40 percent
of purchases are for business occasions, Dearie said.  “The challenge we have now is we just don’t have enough
supply to satisfy demand,” he said.  Treasury’s focus in China is to sell premium mass market
wines to consumers between the ages of 20 and 45 with annual
disposable income of 150,000 to 200,000  yuan  ($24,100 to
$32,100) a year, Dearie said.  “We see Asia contributing nearly A$200 million ($208
million)” to Treasury’s earnings before interest and tax by
2016, David Errington, an analyst at Bank of America Corp.’s
Merrill Lynch unit, wrote in a note to clients March 19.  2008 Vintage  Treasury’s 2008 Penfolds Grange Shiraz received a
“perfect” 100-point score from Robert Parker’s Wine Advocate
review. The vintage will also get a boost in sales in Asia
because it was the same year as the Beijing Olympics and the
number eight is considered lucky in China, Errington wrote.  Asia is Treasury’s smallest market by volumes, with sales
of 600,000 12-bottle cases in the six months ended December.
Earnings before interest, tax, and adjustments for the value of
the company’s vineyards were about A$13.5 million in Asia,
compared to A$5.9 million in  Europe  where the company sold 3.4
million cases.  Treasury added 25 staff in the country in the past year,
bringing the total to 40, Dearie said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
