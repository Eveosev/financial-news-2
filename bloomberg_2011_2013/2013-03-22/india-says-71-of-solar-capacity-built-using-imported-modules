More than 70 percent of the 551
megawatts of solar capacity installed in  India  since the start
of its National Solar Mission has been built using imported
modules, the government said today.  India has built 391 megawatts under central government
programs using imported cells and modules over the last three
years, Minister Farooq Abdullah  told  the parliament today.  India last month rejected claims by U.S. suppliers that it
had violated World Trade Organization rules on equipment
imports. The U.S. Trade Representativeâ€™s office filed a
complaint to the WTO claiming that Indian law requires its
solar-energy producers to use domestically manufactured solar
cells and modules and gives subsidies to companies that use
Indian equipment in preference to imports.  India is building 1,000 megawatts of solar plants and is
tendering for 2,000 megawatts more, Tarun Kapoor, joint
secretary in the Ministry for New and  Renewable Energy , said on
Feb. 7.  To contact the reporter on this story:
