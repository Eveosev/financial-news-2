Natural gas may slide next week as
demand for the heating fuel tapers in the U.S. with the approach
warmer weather, a Bloomberg survey showed.  Five of 10 analysts, or 50 percent, forecast that futures
will drop on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  through March 28.
Four, or 40 percent, said gas will rise and one predicted that
prices will stay the same. Last week, 46 percent of participants
said gas would advance.  Below-normal temperatures across the lower 48 states this
week will recede to the central states from March 31 through
April 4, according to MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
 Maryland . Gas has rallied 17 percent this year and topped $4 per
million British thermal units yesterday for the first time since
September 2011, as unusually cold weather boosted demand and
reduced a  supply deficit .  “There’s not really a lot of demand and you have extremely
high prices,” said  John Woods , president of JJ Woods Associates
and Nymex floor trader in New York. “It’s the end of the first
quarter and people are going to take profits.”  Natural gas futures rose 6.3 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$3.872 per million Btu during the first four days of this week
in New York. The futures yesterday jumped to $4.025, the highest
intraday price since Sept. 15, 2011. Gas is heading for its
fifth consecutive weekly gain, the longest streak since the
period ended Jan. 21, 2011.  Stockpile Decline  About half of U.S. households use gas for heating,
according to the Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm.  Gas stockpiles  fell by 62 billion cubic feet to 1.876
trillion in the week ended March 15, more than the five-year
average decline of 26 billion for the period, the EIA reported
yesterday.  Analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg showed an
expected drop of 70 billion.  A  supply surplus  to the five-year average narrowed to 9.5
percent from 11.4 percent. Supplies were 21 percent below year-
earlier levels, the widest  deficit  since April 2008.  The gas survey has correctly forecast the direction of
prices 50 percent of the time since its June 2004 introduction.  Bloomberg’s survey of natural-gas analysts and traders asks
for an assessment of whether Nymex natural-gas futures will
probably rise, fall or remain neutral in the coming week. This
week’s results were:  RISE   FALL   NEUTRAL  4       5     1  To contact the reporter on this story:
