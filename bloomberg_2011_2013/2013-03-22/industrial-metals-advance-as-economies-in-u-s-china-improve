Copper advanced, paring a weekly
loss as economic data from the U.S. and  China , the two biggest
consumers of industrial metals, boosted demand prospects.
Aluminum, zinc, tin and lead also climbed.  Copper for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.9
percent to $7,649 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
traded at $7,636.25 at 11:03 a.m. in  Tokyo . The metal has
dropped 1.5 percent this week. The May contract on the Comex in
New York climbed 0.5 percent to $3.4525 per pound while copper
for July delivery on the Shanghai exchange declined 0.4 percent
to 55,810  yuan  ($8,983) a ton.  U.S. home sales increased 0.8 percent to an annualized rate
of 4.98 million, the most since November 2009, the National
Association of Realtors said. A report from the Conference Board
in New York indicated the U.S. is strengthening while a survey
from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed yesterday
that China’s manufacturing expanded at a faster pace this month.  “Data from the U.S. and China lent support to copper,”
said  Kazuhiko Saito , analyst at broker  Fujitomi Co (8740)  in Tokyo. An
unexpected contraction in German manufacturing and concern over
Europe’s debt crisis would limit further gains in copper, he
said.  Stockpiles monitored by exchanges in the U.S., London and
Shanghai have surged 45 percent this year to the highest since
November 2003.  To contact the reporter on this story:
