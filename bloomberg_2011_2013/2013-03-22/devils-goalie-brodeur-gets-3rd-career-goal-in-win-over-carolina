Goalie  Martin Brodeur  scored a
power-play goal to help the  New Jersey Devils  beat the Carolina
Hurricanes 4-1 in.  Brodeur, 40, tallied his third career National Hockey
League goal three minutes, 54 seconds into the game. He was
playing for the first time since Feb. 21 because of a pinched
nerve in his upper back and neck.  With  New Jersey  on a power play, a delayed penalty was
called against the Devils and Carolina goalie Dan Ellis headed
to the bench. Carolina’s Jordan Staal passed the puck back to
the point from behind the New Jersey net and it slid all the way
down the ice into the Hurricanes’ open net. Since Brodeur was
the last Devils player to touch the puck, he got credit for an
unassisted goal.  “When the puck went in the net, I was like, ‘Whoa, what
happened there?”’ Brodeur told reporters. “I didn’t even know
we had a delayed penalty or anything, so it was a little
surprising.”  Brodeur’s earlier goals came in a 5-2 playoff win against
the  Montreal Canadiens  on April 17, 1997, and in a 4-2 victory
against the  Philadelphia Flyers  on Feb. 15, 2000.  Adam Henrique and Peter Harrold added goals for the Devils
in the second period and Andrei Loktionov added a power-play
goal in the final period at PNC Arena in Raleigh, North Carolina.
Jeff Skinner scored a power-play goal for the Hurricanes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
