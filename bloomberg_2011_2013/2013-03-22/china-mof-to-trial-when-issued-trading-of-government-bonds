China’s finance ministry said it
will begin a trial allowing investors to trade  government bonds 
before they are sold to help develop the market.  The Ministry of Finance  said  the so-called when-issued
trading can start four working days before the auction date and
end one day ahead of the actual sale, according to a statement
on its website. It didn’t say when the program will kick off.
The system will “facilitate the healthy development of the
government bond market,” it said.  When-issued trading allows governments to gauge demand for
securities before proceeding with the issuance. Japan started
such a system in 2004 after the first failure of a 10-year bond
auction since the country began selling debt by competitive
bidding in 1989.  China’s central bank proposed rules for when-issued trading
in December 2005.  -- Judy Chen . Editors: Simon Harvey, Andrew Janes  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
