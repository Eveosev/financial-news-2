FedEx Corp. (FDX)  said it agreed to buy
14  Boeing Co. (BA)  757 passenger jets from  United Continental
Holdings Inc. (UAL)  and convert them into freighters, part of a plan
to save on fuel costs with newer, more efficient planes.  The package-delivery company will take possession of the
narrow-body jets this year through 2015, and the March 8
agreement includes an option to purchase another 16 of the
planes, FedEx said today in a  regulatory filing . The  Memphis ,
Tennessee-based company also has 70 767s and 777s on order,
according to the filing.  FedEx began buying 757s in 2007, as passenger airlines
began shedding them, to phase out its older Boeing 727s, echoing
a shift already under way at  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  The used
757s, which Boeing stopped building in 2005, are cheaper than
new models and still provide a class of planes that can carry 20
percent more freight while burning a third less  fuel  than the
three-engine 727s.  Freighter conversions take about three months to complete
and can cost about $5 million per plane. FedEx didnâ€™t disclose
the price of its deal with United. The airline owned 56 Boeing
757s as of Dec. 31, according to a filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
