The U.K.’s  Met Office  issued severe
weather warnings today, saying heavy snow, sleet and rain may
pose health risks and disrupt travel across Britain.  There is a 90 percent chance of “severe cold weather, icy
conditions and heavy snow” through the morning of March 25, the
national weather forecaster said on its website today.  More than 60 millimeters (2.4 inches) of rain may fall in
southern and southwestern parts of the U.K. today, according to
the Met. Rain may turn to snow as storms move northeast, with as
much as 30 centimeters of snow falling in some areas of north
 Wales , the Midlands, northern England, southwest Scotland and
Northern Ireland today and tomorrow.  Sixty schools are closed in  Northern Ireland  due to snow,
Sky News reported.  London’s Heathrow, Gatwick and Luton airports were all
operating normally as of 9:17 a.m. in the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
