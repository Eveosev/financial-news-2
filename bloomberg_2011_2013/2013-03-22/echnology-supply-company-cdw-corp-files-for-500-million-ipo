CDW Corp., the technology supply
company owned by Madison Dearborn Partners LLC and Providence
Equity Partners Inc., filed for a $500 million initial public
offering in the U.S.  JPMorgan Chase & Co., Barclays Plc and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. are leading the offering for the Vernon Hills, Illinois-
based company, according to a regulatory filing today. The $500
million amount is a placeholder that may change.  Madison Dearborn, a Chicago-based private-equity firm, and
Providence acquired CDW for $6.7 billion in 2007 at the height
of biggest buyout boom in history, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. CDW, which makes software and hardware for corporate and
government clients, generated more than $10 billion in revenue
last year.  Madison Dearborn and Providence didnâ€™t say in the filing
whether they would offer shares in the IPO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
