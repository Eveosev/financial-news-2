China Datang Corp. Renewable Power
Co. (1798) , a state-owned wind-energy developer, said 2012 profit
declined 85 percent as slower first-quarter wind speeds and
“grid curtailment” in some regions reduced power generated  Net income fell to 112.1 million  yuan  ($18 million) from
729.8 million yuan in 2011, Datang Renewables said yesterday in
a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange. This compares with
the 243.7 million yuan mean of nine analyst estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Revenue increased 14 percent to 4.37 billion yuan.  China’s electricity grids are unable to absorb the influx
of wind power, forcing the government to tighten approvals on
new projects and slow the development of the industry.
Installations of  wind turbines  in  China  fell 18 percent to 15.9
gigawatts last year from 2011, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  “In order to guarantee income from the wind power business
amid severe grid curtailment, the group proactively controlled
the construction progress of wind-power projects,” Datang
Renewables said yesterday. Total installed capacity rose 9.7
percent in 2012 to 5,771 megawatts on Dec. 31, Datang said.  The National Energy Administration issued new permits for
wind farms on Mar. 19, except in Jilin, Inner Mongolia and
Heilongjiang provinces, where the grid has been overloaded with
renewable energy. The NEA said it will work to improve
connections of wind power to grids.  The stock rose 4 percent to close at HK$1.57 in Hong Kong
trading yesterday, before the company announced earnings. The
shares have gained 59 percent this year, compared with a 2.4
percent decline in the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
