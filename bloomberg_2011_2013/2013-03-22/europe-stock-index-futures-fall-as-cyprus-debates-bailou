European stocks were little
changed, with the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index falling for the first
week in a month, as Cypriot lawmakers sought to unlock a 10-
billion-euro ($13 billion) bailout fund.  Marine Harvest (MHG)  ASA climbed the most in nearly five months
as a tightening fish supply and rising prices boost the
company’s earnings outlook. MAN SE slid the most in five months
as Volkswagen AG plans to offer shareholders 80.89 euros per
share to get full control of the truckmaker. Mulberry Group Plc,
a British luxury-handbag maker, plunged the most since October
after saying full-year sales and profit will miss estimates.  The  Stoxx 600 (SXXP)  slipped 0.2 percent to 294.04 at the close of
trading, erasing earlier gains of as much as 0.3 percent. The
benchmark index lost 1.1 percent this week, snapping four
straight weeks of gains. The number of shares changing hands in
companies on the Stoxx 600 was 0.9 percent higher than the
average of the past 30 days, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “We’re waiting to see what will happen with Cyprus,” said
 Arnaud Scarpaci , a  fund manager  at Montaigne Capital in Paris,
which oversees $260 million. “We think a solution will be
found.”  Cypriot lawmakers today debate legislation to unlock
bailout funds. The ECB has said it will cut emergency funds for
the Mediterranean island’s lenders after March 25 unless it
agrees on a bailout with international creditors.  Proposal Expected  Euro-area finance ministers expect a proposal from Cyprus
“as rapidly as possible” to raise the 5.8 billion euros needed
to trigger the emergency loans, they said in a statement late
yesterday.  Cyprus didn’t get the financial support it sought from
 Russia , although the two countries will continue talking, Cyprus
Finance Minister Michael Sarris said.  The race for a compromise comes after a week of tumult
marked by Cypriot lawmakers’ rejection of a tax on  bank
deposits . That was demanded by the other 16 euro countries and
the  International Monetary Fund  as a condition for the 10
billion-euro rescue.  In  Germany , business confidence unexpectedly fell in March
from a 10-month high. The Ifo institute in Munich said its
business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
fell to 106.7 this month from 107.4 in February. That’s the
first drop in five months. Economists predicted a gain to 107.8,
according to the median of forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  National Indexes  National benchmark indexes declined in 11 of the 18 western
European markets. France’s CAC 40 lost 0.1 percent, Germany’s
DAX slipped 0.3 percent, while the U.K.’s FTSE increased 0.1
percent.  Marine Harvest jumped 3 percent to 5.41 kroner. Nordea
Securities raised its recommendation on the world’s largest
publicly-traded salmon farmer to strong buy from buy, citing
better than expected salmon spot prices in Europe and the U.S.  AstraZeneca Plc (AZN)  advanced 3.3 percent to 3,236 pence, its
highest price since October 2010. The U.K.’s second-biggest
drugmaker gained credibility on plans to reshape research and
development and return to growth, Morgan Stanley analyst Peter Verdult wrote in a note following yesterday’s investor meeting.  BP Plc rose 1.9 percent to 457.7 pence. The  oil company 
will buy back $8 billion of shares from investors after
completing the sale of 50 percent of Russian oil producer TNK-
BP.  Volkswagen Offer  MAN lost 2.6 percent to 84.80 euros. VW, Europe’s largest
carmaker, will offer other holders of MAN stock 80.89 euros per
share in a bid for full control of the company. VW, which
already owns 75.03 percent of the Munich-based company’s voting
rights, will set the final cash offer after it receives
valuation reports from auditors, MAN said yesterday. Volkswagen
added 0.8 percent to 156.55 euros.  Mulberry (MUL)  plunged 17 percent to 1,024 pence. The company
said that lower tourist spending in  London  will reduce pretax
profit for the year ending March 31 to about 26 million pounds
($39.5 million) from 36 million pounds. The average estimate of
three analysts compiled by Bloomberg was 30.7 million pounds.  Hochtief AG, Germany’s largest builder, slid 5.3 percent to
51.41 euros. Leighton Holdings Ltd. Chairman Stephen Johns and
two non-executive directors resigned from the board of
 Australia ’s largest construction company, citing a dispute with
its controlling shareholder Hochtief.  Homeserve Plc (HSV) , the U.K. repair-service provider being
investigated by the Financial Services Authority, slid 5.2
percent to 211.4 pence after saying it will cuts jobs in the
U.K., where it’s losing customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
