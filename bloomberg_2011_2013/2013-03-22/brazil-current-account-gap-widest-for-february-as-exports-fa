Brazil ’s  current account deficit 
was the widest ever for the month of February, as exports fell
while imports rose.  The deficit in the current account, the broadest measure of
trade in goods and services, widened in February to $6.6 billion
from $1.7 billion a year earlier, the central bank said in a
report distributed today in Brasilia. Analysts forecast a gap of
$6 billion, according to the median estimate from 18 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Foreign direct investment  in February rose to $3.8 billion
from $3.7 billion in January, the central bank said. Economists
forecast investments of $3.5 billion, according to the median
estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s government has implemented
measures aimed at rebuilding business confidence and stoking
investments, which dropped 4 percent in 2012. Officials this
year have traveled to New York and  London  to drum up interest in
Brazil’s $235 billion infrastructure program, announced plans to
privatize ports and extended payroll tax cuts to new industries.
The central bank predicts foreign investment will hover around
record levels in 2013, after it exceeded forecasts last year.  After growing 0.9 percent in 2012, the slowest among major
 emerging markets , Brazil’s $2.5 trillion economy will expand by
at least 3 percent this year, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega 
said on March 1.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 7.78 percent at 10:35 a.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.3 percent to 2.0132 per  U.S. dollar .  Trade Deficit  Brazil’s trade deficit in February was $1.3 billion,
compared with a surplus of $1.7 billion a year ago, according to
the central bank. Exports fell 13.8 percent to $15.5 billion
from a year earlier, while imports rose 3 percent to $16.8
billion.  The central bank revised its prediction for the current
account in 2013 to a $67 billion deficit, from $65 billion
previously, while maintaining its forecast for foreign
investment at $65 billion.  Earlier this month,  3i Group Plc (III)  and investors  Neuberger
Berman Group LLC (NBIHYUA)  and Siguler Guff & Co agreed to spend a total
of 108 million reais ($53.7 billion) to buy Oticas Carol, the
second-largest eyeglass retailer in Brazil. The three companies
invested in the Sao Paulo-based Oticas Carol to penetrate
Brazil’s growing middle class.  While growth in the world’s second-largest emerging has
slowed, inflation has approached the upper limit of the central
bank’s target range.  Annual inflation  through mid-March
accelerated to 6.43 percent, the highest level since January
2012. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or
minus two percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
