International Container Terminal
Services Inc. (ICT) , the largest Philippine port operator, jumped to a
record in  Manila  trading after the company signed a $624 million
contract for a port in Honduras.  The  company  rose 3.7 percent to 90.50 pesos as of 2:19 p.m.
in Manila, heading for the highest close since it started
trading in March 1992. The stock, which earlier climbed as much
as 6.5 percent, was the second-biggest contributor to the 0.9
percent gain of the benchmark  Philippine Stock Exchange Index. (PCOMP)   ICTSI, as the company based in Manila is also called, said
it signed a 30-year contract to upgrade and manage the container
and general cargo terminal for Puerto Cortes in  Honduras . ICTSI,
operator of Manila’s largest port, has 27 terminal concessions
and port development projects in 19 countries including Brazil
and China, according to its 2012 annual report. The company won
the Honduran contract in February.  “The stock is trading on the growth of its port
portfolio,” said Rico Gomez, who helps manage $2.8 billion at
Rizal Commercial Banking Corp. “ICTSI has proven it can take
advantage of a weak global economy by expanding its port
concessions.”  ICTSI’s profit increased 9.7 percent to $143.2 million in
2012 as revenue rose 9.7 percent to $729.3 million driven by an
8 percent gain in volumes at its ports and terminals at home and
abroad, according to a stock exchange filing on March 11.  The company has set a $550 million budget for  capital
expenditures  this year, mainly to complete projects in Argentina
and Mexico and to accelerate construction in Colombia and Davao,
a city in southern Philippines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
