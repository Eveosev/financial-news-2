Vietnam  stocks  surged, driving the
benchmark index to a two-year high on mounting speculation the
central bank will cut interest rates to spur economic growth.  The  Ho Chi Minh City  Stock Exchange’s  VN Index (VNINDEX)  rose 1.2
percent, the most among Asian benchmark gauges tracked by
Bloomberg, to 497.58 as of 10:34 a.m. local time. The index is
poised for its highest close since Feb. 18, 2011.  Vietnam Dairy
Products Joint-Stock Co. (VNM) , the nation’s biggest listed dairy
producer, surged 2.7 percent to a record, while  Masan Group Co. (MSN) 
jumped 3.1 percent.  The VN Index has climbed 3.5 percent the past three days
after online newswire CafeF reported March 20 that consumer
prices in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City dropped 0.21 and 0.29
percent respectively in March versus February. The State Bank of
Vietnam cut the refinancing rate and discount rate by one
percentage point on Dec. 24.  “As inflation slows in the two biggest cities, inflation
for the nation would be slow this month, giving more room for
the central bank to cut  interest rates  further,” Giang Trung Kien, Hanoi-based head of research at FPT Securities Joint-Stock
Co., said by phone today. News that commercial lenders have
lowered dong deposit rates also drove the rate-cut rumors, Kien
said.  Vietnamese lenders including  Joint-Stock Bank for Foreign
Trade of Vietnam  and Saigon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint-Stock
Bank cut dong deposit rates to as low as 7.5 percent, Tuoi Tre
newspaper reported yesterday, without saying where it got the
information.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
