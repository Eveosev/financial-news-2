Premier League soccer club West Ham
will become the new tenant of  London ’s Olympic Stadium from 2016
after the U.K. government agreed to pay 25 million pounds ($38
million) to help refurbish the venue, the British Broadcasting
Corp. reported.       Total cost to change the centerpiece of the London 2012
Olympic and Paralympic Games into a venue suitable for a soccer
team will be as much as 190 million pounds, the  BBC  said on its
website.   The stadium roof will be extended, while seating capacity
will be reduced by 20,000 to 60,000. The stadium will keep its
running track, with seats sliding over it during soccer matches.  An agreement was struck after West Ham boosted its own
contribution to 15 million pounds, from an initial 5 million
pounds. The club will pay 2 million pounds rent a year. The U.K.
Treasury’s contributions will now total 60 million pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
