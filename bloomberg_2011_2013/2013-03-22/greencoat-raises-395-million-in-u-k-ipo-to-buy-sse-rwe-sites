Greencoat U.K. Wind Plc raised 260
million pounds ($395 million) in Britain’s biggest renewable-
energy initial public offering, gaining funds to buy wind farms
from  RWE AG (RWE)  and  SSE Plc. (SSE)   Greencoat placed 260 million shares at 100 pence apiece,
exceeding an initial target of about 205 million pounds, the
London-based company said today in a statement. It will acquire
interests in six operational wind farms in Britain with a
combined capacity of 126.5 megawatts.  The offering is a boon for the U.K. wind industry, the
focus of government plans to get 30 percent of power from
renewable sources by the end of the decade, up from almost 12
percent now. Britain’s program of wind-farm subsidies underpins
Greencoat’s targeted 6 percent dividend yield, the company said.  SSE, based in Perth,  Scotland , had already agreed to sell
four wind farms for 140 million pounds to Greencoat, with as
much as 43 million pounds of that to be invested in the IPO. As
the share sale was oversubscribed, SSE scaled back its
investment to 10 million pounds, while the U.K. Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills contributed 50 million pounds.  Greencoat’s acquisitions will include a 24.95 percent share
in the 90-megawatt Rhyl Flats wind park off North Wales.
Britain’s Green Investment Bank also bought a stake of the same
size in Rhyl Flats from RWE for 57.5 million pounds, it said in
a separate statement.  Greencoat will admit the shares to the London Stock
Exchange on March 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
