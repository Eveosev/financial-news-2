Japanese  government bonds  rose,
pushing benchmark yields closer to an all-time low, after  Bank
of Japan (8301)  Governor  Haruhiko Kuroda  reiterated that he will do
whatever he can to defeat deflation.  Bond futures touched the highest level on record after
Kuroda said yesterday at his first press conference as BOJ chief
that he would try to achieve a 2 percent price target as soon as
possible. Thirty-year bonds led gains, with yields reaching a
more than two-year low, on expectations Kuroda will follow
through on comments that the BOJ should buy longer-term debt to
achieve its policy goals.  “Expectations for the BOJ to buy longer-maturity debt are
giving investors confidence to buy,” said Shinichi Horikawa,
the general manager of the accounting and investment department
at Mitsui Sumitomo Aioi Life Insurance Co. in  Tokyo , which
manages the equivalent of $24 billion. “It’ll take some time to
see whether the 2 percent inflation target is achievable for the
BOJ.”  The yield on the benchmark 10-year note fell 1 1/2 basis
points to 0.565 percent at 2:16 p.m. in Tokyo, according to
 Japan  Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. The price of the 0.6 percent security maturing in March
2023 advanced 0.142 yen to 100.330.  2003 Record  The debt advanced for a second day, sending yields toward
the record low of 0.43 percent set in June 2003. Expectations
that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s picks to run the BOJ would
expand stimulus have pushed the rates down 23 basis points this
quarter, the most since the three months ended in June 2010.
Ten-year bond futures reached 145.74, a record for lead
contracts.  Thirty-year rates declined five basis points to 1.625
percent, matching the lowest since August 2010.  Kuroda said in parliamentary hearings this month that asset
purchases by the central bank haven’t been sufficient and it
should consider buying large amounts of longer-term debt. The
BOJ’s current-account balance rose to a record 50.7 trillion yen
($534 billion) yesterday, according to a statement today from
the bank.  Kuroda will appear before parliament on March 26, ruling
Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Katsutoshi Kaneda said today.  Japan’s bond yields are the lowest globally, even with a
debt burden projected to reach 245 percent of the nation’s
economic output this year, the most in the world, according to
estimates by the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
