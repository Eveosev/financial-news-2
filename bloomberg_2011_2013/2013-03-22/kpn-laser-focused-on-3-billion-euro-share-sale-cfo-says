Royal  KPN NV (KPN) , the Dutch phone
operator partly owned by  Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil (AMXL)  SAB, is now
“laser focused” on selling 3 billion euros ($3.9 billion) in
shares after closing a hybrid bond program, Chief Financial
Officer Eric Hageman said.  “Just as in  Europe , we’ve found a lot of interested
investors in the U.S. and Asia that really believed in our
story,” Hageman said in a telephone interview today, adding the
hybrid bonds -- which are expected to receive 50 percent equity
recognition -- were oversubscribed by more than eight times.  KPN sold $600 million in 60-year notes that it can redeem
in 10 years at a yield of 7 percent amid record European sales
of securities that combine features of debt and equity. The
proceeds will be about 465 million euros, according to a
statement from The Hague-based operator. Together with a 1.56
billion-euro issue on March 14, this will complete the 2
billion-euro bond program, KPN said.  That leaves a 3 billion-euro share sale that needs approval
from shareholders next month to complete the capital injection
announced by the company on Feb. 20.  KPN needs the money to strengthen its balance sheet after
spending 1.35 billion euros on mobile network spectrum in the
fourth quarter. Investing in faster mobile networks is key for
carriers as consumers increasingly use smartphones to surf the
web, download music and watch videos. KPN also faces increased
competition in the Netherlands from Stockholm-based  Tele2 AB. (TEL2B)   To contact the reporter on this story:
