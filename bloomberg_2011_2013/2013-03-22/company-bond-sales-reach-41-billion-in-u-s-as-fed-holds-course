and 2.7 percent in 2014, the most since 2006, according to the

start cutting back on support,” Marc Gross, a  money manager  at
RS Investments in  New York  who oversees $3.5 billion in fixed-
income funds, said in a telephone interview. The economy “is
almost at a sweet spot; it’s strong enough to keep companies
from defaulting and keep them growing, and it’s not too strong
where interest rates are going to rise by a huge amount.”  The extra yield investors demand to own corporate bonds

market still scarred by the deepest recession since the Great
Depression, said it decided to leave the pace of asset purchases

above 6.5 percent and the outlook for inflation is less than 2.5
