Rubber was poised for a second
weekly decline amid concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening and as the Japanese currency strengthened, reducing
the appeal of yen-based contracts.  The contract for delivery in August lost as much as 2.5
percent to 275.1 yen a kilogram ($2,900 a metric ton) on the
Tokyo Commodity Exchange and was at 277.5 yen at 11:24 a.m.
Futures fell 1.8 percent this week and 8.3 percent this year.  The  European Central Bank  gave Cyprus until the start of
next week to agree to a bailout package or lose emergency
funding. The yen strengthened this week against 14 of its 16
major counterparts, trading at 94.88 per dollar, on speculation
stimulus efforts by new  Bank of Japan  leadership will fall short
of investor expectations.  “The strengthening yen and Cyprus news pushed down
commodity prices including rubber,” said Gu Jiong, an analyst
at commodity broker  Yutaka Shoji Co. (8747)   Rubber is poised to enter a  bear market  in the next month
as a dead-cross formation signals a further sell-off, according
to Trading Central SA. Support was forecast at 242 yen, a level
last seen in November, said Ludwig Garric, a technical analyst
at the Paris-based company.  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange dropped 0.4 percent to 22,805  yuan  ($3,671) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board rose 1.2 percent to 86.60 baht ($2.97) a
kilogram yesterday, the Rubber Research Institute of Thailand
said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
