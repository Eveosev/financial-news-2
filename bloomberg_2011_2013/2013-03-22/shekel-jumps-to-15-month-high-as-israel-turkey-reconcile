The shekel strengthened to the
highest level in almost 15 months versus the dollar as  Israel 
normalized ties with Turkey.  The Israeli currency gained 0.4 percent to 3.65 per dollar
by 12:44 p.m. in New York, while Turkey’s lira added as much as
0.3 percent. The  Bloomberg Israel-US Index (ISRA25BN)  of the largest
Israeli companies traded in the U.S. fell 0.3 percent.  Israeli Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  and his Turkish
counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan agreed to normalize ties and
reinstate ambassadors in a phone call, according to Netanyahu’s
office. Israel apologized for the deaths of nine Turks on an aid
flotilla to Gaza in 2010, according to officials from Israel and
the U.S. who asked for anonymity. Erdogan accepted the apology,
the officials said.  “The ties are positive,” said Guillaume Salomon, chief
emerging-markets strategist at Societe Generale SA in London,
said by phone. “Any ties that bring Israel closer to some of
its neighbors is good news. I’m very positive on the shekel.”  The shekel is the best performer among 13 Middle Eastern
currencies tracked by Bloomberg this year, gaining 2.3 percent
versus the dollar. The lira has weakened 1.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
