ERG SpA (ERG) , the Italian oil refiner
and electricity company, got a 35 million-euro ($45 million)
loan from ING Bank NV and the corporate and investment banking
arm of  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  to finance a wind farm in  Italy .  The 14-year, project-finance loan is for the 22.5 megawatt
Amaroni wind farm, according to a statement today from the
company’s clean energy unit ERG Renew. The plant in Catanzaro,
southern Italy started generating late last year using turbines
made by  Nordex SE (NDX1) , the German turbine maker’s website shows.  Cariparma Gruppo Credit Agricole acted as account bank, and
Credit Agricole CIB was the agent bank, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
