A step by Japanese Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe’s government toward relocating the U.S. military base
on Okinawa was praised by the Pentagon’s spokesman as a “key
milestone that comes after many years of hard work.”  The government’s effort to obtain a landfill permit shows
its support for achieving “a sustainable U.S. military presence
with less impact on the Okinawan people,” George Little, the
spokesman, said today in an e-mailed statement.  Abe’s government submitted an application to Okinawa’s
prefectural government to reclaim land needed to move the U.S.
Marine Corps Futenma Air Station to a site near Henoko, the
Kyodo News reported today from  Tokyo .  It’s a politically sensitive effort by Abe’s government to
restart longtime plans to relocate the base from a crowded
residential district where it has contributed to strains in
U.S.-Japan relations. Sentiment among officials and residents on
Okinawa has been that the base should be closed, not moved
within the island. Critics blame the American presence for crime
and pollution.  In addition to moving the air station on Okinawa, the U.S.
plans to move some troops from there to Guam and  Australia  as it
acts on a global strategy calling for more emphasis on the Asia
Pacific region.  “This effort is critical to our ongoing rebalance to the
Asia-Pacific region and our ability to maintain a well-
distributed and politically sustainable force throughout Asia,”
Little said in the statement.  For Related News and Information:
