Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , the
world’s largest flat-panel maker, is trying to sell Dutch
subsidiary  Liquavista BV  to  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , according to a
person familiar with the matter.  Samsung is seeking a sale of the Eindhoven, Netherlands-
based maker of electronic-reader display technology for less
than $100 million, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the discussions are private. Samsung,
based in Suwon,  South Korea ,  acquired  Liquavista in 2011.  Liquavista, founded in 2006, specializes in a type of
display technology known as electrowetting, mostly used in
electronic readers, a shrinking market that’s dominated by
Amazon’s Kindle devices. Samsung has followed a shift in
consumer preference to smartphones and tablets, which mainly use
liquid-crystal displays, or LCDs.  Shipments of e-book readers will  decline  27 percent to 10.9
million units in 2013, according to researcher  IHS Inc. (IHS)  By 2016,
IHS expects 7.1 million e-readers to ship, less than a third of
the peak volume seen in 2011.  Samsung is considering a sale of the business after the
acquisition didn’t meet its expectations, the person said.  “We are currently reviewing many plans, including the
sale, but nothing has been confirmed yet,” Chenny Kim, a
spokeswoman for Samsung, said by phone today.  Ty Rogers, a spokesman for Seattle-based Amazon, declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
