Australian Resources Minister
 Martin Ferguson  resigned today in the third departure from Prime
Minister Julia Gillard’s cabinet since she retained the Labor
party leadership yesterday.  Ferguson told reporters he would have supported former
prime minister Kevin Rudd had he stood against Gillard yesterday
in a leadership ballot, and that quitting the cabinet was now
the “honorable” thing to do.  “I will go to the backbench, give the government my
absolute support and contribute to policy debate,” Ferguson
told reporters in Canberra, adding he will stand at the next
election and serve a full term. “It was not an easy decision,
it’s the honorable decision and I do not resile from it.”  Ferguson, 59, served as resources, tourism and energy
minister since the election of the Labor government in 2007 and
was a senior member of the cabinet. A former president of the
Australian Council of Trade Unions, he was elected to parliament
in 1996 and served continuously on Labor’s front bench.  Ferguson joins  Simon Crean , also a former ACTU president,
and  Chris Bowen  in leaving Gillard’s cabinet since she won a
leadership ballot unopposed yesterday. Ferguson, like Crean,
invoked the legacy of the Labor governments of  Bob Hawke  and
 Paul Keating  in urging the Gillard administration to stay true
to the party’s values.  The Minerals Council of Australia said in a statement
Ferguson was “an excellent minister who will be greatly missed
by Australia’s mining sector.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
