Justin Rose  takes a two-shot lead
into the second round of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where
Tiger Woods trails by four shots as he attempts to return to the
top of the world rankings with an eighth win at the event.  Rose had a 7-under-par 65 yesterday at Bay Hill Club &
Lodge in Orlando,  Florida , to lead John Huh, who is 5 under.
John Rollins and Brad Fritsch share third, one shot ahead of
Rose’s playing partner, Woods, one of 10 golfers at 3 under par.  “Starting out this morning, the first six, seven, eight
holes felt a grind,” Rose, a 32-year-old from  England , told
reporters. “It was cold. It was windy.”  Defending champion Woods would return to the top of the
 Official World Golf Ranking  for the first time in 2 1/2 years
with a third victory this year on the  PGA Tour . Woods, 37, has
won five times in his past 20 starts on the world’s richest golf
tour. An eighth title at Bay Hill would also tie him with  Sam Snead  for the most victories at a single PGA Tour event.  Woods tied for the lead with an eagle on the 16th hole
yesterday before dropping back with bogeys at his last two
holes.  ’’I didn’t drive it well, didn’t hit my irons well and
didn’t control my distances or trajectory well,’’ Woods said.
“But I scored well and I kept myself in the tournament.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
