The  U.S. dollar  may fall to an
almost one-month low against the yen in coming weeks, according
to Gaitame.com Research Institute Ltd., citing trading patterns.  The greenback will probably decline to the Feb. 25 low of
90.88 yen in half a month, should it breach its 20-day moving
average of 94.50, said Takuya Kawabata, an analyst at a unit of
 Japan ’s largest currency margin company. The 94.50 level is also
close to the dollar’s Feb. 12 intra-day high of 94.41 that has
been acting as a key support level, he said.  “The drop could get quite deep,” Kawabata said. “The
formation on the candlestick chart looks bearish for the dollar.
Its intraday highs have been grinding lower in the past week and
have failed to reach 97 yen, showing the recent gains are
stalling.”  The dollar was little changed at 94.93 yen at 12:22 p.m. in
Tokyo from yesterday, when it dropped 1.2 percent. The U.S.
currency reached 96.71 on March 12, the highest since August
2009.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen against the
dollar compared with those on a gain --  so-called net shorts  --
was 93,763 on March 12, the most since the week ended Dec. 14,
according to figures from the Washington-based Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.  “The yen short position is starting to look quite
extended,” Kawabata said. “I’ll be watching how much unwinding
there may be this week.”  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an area on a
