U.S. lawmakers plan to summon
regulators and outside consulting firms to explain shortcomings
in a multi-billion dollar settlement over botched mortgage
foreclosures, according to two people briefed on the plan.  Senator  Sherrod Brown , chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee’s subcommittee on financial institutions, is
scheduling a hearing to examine the relationship between federal
agencies and third-party firms for mid-April, according to the
people, who asked not to be named because the hearing hasn’t
been announced.  As part of the 2011 foreclosure settlement, banks paid
firms including Promontory Financial Group LLC, Ernst & Young
LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP almost $2 billion to search
for errors in foreclosures and recommend compensation for
cheated borrowers. Regulators required many of the largest U.S.
mortgage servicers to hire independent consultants to review
foreclosures -- a system that was mostly halted in January when
13 servicers agreed to pay $9.3 billion in compensation and
mortgage assistance.  Spokeswomen for the firms -- Debra Cope at Promontory, Amy Call Well at Ernst & Young and Caroline Nolan at
PricewaterhouseCoopers -- didn’t immediately respond to
telephone messages seeking comment on the hearing.  Comptroller of the Currency  Thomas Curry , whose agency
regulates many of the affected mortgage servicers, has said the
cost of consultants’ reviews threatened to “far exceed” the
eventual payout for borrowers who had been wronged. This week,
about 4.2 million borrowers were sent cards informing them they
will receive payments from the January settlement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
