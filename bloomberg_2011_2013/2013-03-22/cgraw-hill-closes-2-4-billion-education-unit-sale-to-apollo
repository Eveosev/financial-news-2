McGraw-Hill Cos. completed the sale
of its education unit to  Apollo Global Management LLC (APO)  for $2.4
billion in cash.  Some of the proceeds from the transaction will fund share
buybacks, the New York-based firm said in a statement today
distributed by PRNewswire. The remaining company, to be renamed
McGraw Hill Financial Inc., is also using part of the $1.9
billion it will receive after tax to pay down short-term debt
and the rest may pay for “selective tuck-in acquisitions,”
according to the statement.  Chief Executive Officer Harold “Terry” McGraw III decided
in September 2011 to sell the education division, which his
great-grandfather started 125 years ago, after pressure from
Jana Partners LLC, a New York-based hedge fund, and the  Ontario
Teachers’ Pension Plan .  The U.S. Department of Justice sued the company Feb. 4,
alleging that its Standard & Poor’s ratings unit inflated grades
to win business from Wall Street banks. S&P will be at the
center of the new company, accounting for about half its
revenue, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
