Skylark Co., a Japanese restaurant
operator controlled by Bain Capital LLC, is considering an
initial public offering in Tokyo as early as next year, two
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Bain , which manages $67 billion in assets, is also
considering a private sale of the company, according to one of
the people, who asked not to be named because the discussions
are private. The Boston-based firm acquired Skylark in 2011 for
160 billion yen ($1.7 billion) from a group of investors
including  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)   Skylark, which operates Gusto and Jonathan’s restaurants in
 Japan , in January appointed former McDonald’s Corp. President
Ralph Alvarez as chairman to help expand its operations. The 50-
year-old company, which  delisted  from the Tokyo bourse in 2006,
had revenue of 342 billion yen in 2011 and employs about 5,400
people.  Officials at Bain in Tokyo couldn’t be reached to comment
on the possible sale yesterday. Junichi Kawaminami, a Skylark
spokesman, said the company is studying all possible options for
growth.  Bain executives David Gross-Loh, Andrew Balson and Yuji
Sugimoto are outside directors sitting on Skylark’s five-member
board, according to the Tokyo-based company’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
