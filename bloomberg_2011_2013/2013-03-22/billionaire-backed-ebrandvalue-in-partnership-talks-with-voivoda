Ebrandvalue , a Turkish brand measurement startup backed by investors including billionaire Husnu Ozyegin, said it’s in partnership talks with California-based venture capital firm VoiVoda Ventures to expand.  “Our aim is to incubate in  Turkey  and use this position to scale up in the U.S market,” Tolga Akcura, founding partner of the company, said in an interview in Istanbul. “A potential partnership with VoiVoda would help us achieve this.”  Ebrandvalue is using social media services such as  Twitter Inc. (TWTR)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  to capture a profile of users and their attitudes to certain brands, said Akcura, a former sales manager at  Procter & Gamble Co. (PG)  and  International Business Machines Corp.. (IBM)  The company started operations in May last year.  Software companies that develop applications for smart devices and e-commerce companies dominate Turkey’s startup market, which has attracted investment from companies including  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.  Akcura and Murat Lostar control the company. Smaller partners include Ozunde Girisim AS, a venture capital firm controlled by Husnu Ozyegin, Turkey’s third richest man.  Multinational consumer goods producers, alcoholic and soft drink makers and foundation universities, which include Bilgi University of Istanbul, are among the clients, Akcura said.
