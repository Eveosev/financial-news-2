Chuka Umunna, the business
spokesman for the U.K.’s opposition Labour Party, said the
government should look at blacklisting large companies that
delay payments to suppliers.  “Too many small businesses are effectively bankrolling
bigger businesses that refuse to pay them on time,” Umunna said
in a speech today to the  Federation of Small Businesses  in
Leicester, central England. “The next Labour government will
expose those who pay late and we will seek to put in place a
regime that will automatically trigger action against late
payers, perhaps by preventing them winning public contracts.”  Umunna, 34, also proposed banning energy suppliers from
moving small businesses to more expensive tariffs without their
consent and said gas and electricity companies shouldn’t be
allowed to demand immediate full repayment from customers who
fall behind on their bills.  Labour is trying to appeal to businesses for support after
many turned against the party before the 2010 election. Its
leader, Ed Miliband, said on March 14 that if elected, the party
would create a network of regional banks to lend to companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
