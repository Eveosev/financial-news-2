Solar stocks, the most volatile
Chinese equities in New York, will extend declines as  Suntech
Power Holdings Co. (STP) ’s bankruptcy stokes concern they are over-
leveraged, according to  Gamco Investors Inc. (GBL)   Four of the five stocks with the highest annualized
volatility this year among the most-traded Chinese companies in
the U.S. are solar makers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  LDK Solar Co. (LDK) , the Xinyu, China-based solar wafer
maker down 15 percent in 2013, is posting the widest price
swings behind Suntech, which plunged 40 percent this week after
defaulting on $541 million of bonds. The  Bloomberg China-US
Equity Index (CH55BN)  advanced 0.5 percent.  Suntech’s inability to repay its debt has brought attention
to an industry that has been struggling with excess capacity and
slowing demand for alternative energy as governments reduce
subsidies.  China ’s four major solar producers, including LDK,
have reported net losses for at least six straight quarters.
Suntech, which had more than $2.2 billion of debt by end-March
2012, was subject to a bankruptcy petition this week from eight
of its Chinese lenders.  “There clearly will be pressure on other Chinese stocks
with heavily leveraged balance sheets and non-existent cash
flows,” David Smith, manager of the Gamco’s Gabelli Green Fund,
which sold out of its holdings in Chinese solar stocks before
2012, said by e-mail yesterday from Purchase, New York. “The
outlook also is strained by Suntech continuing its production.
Suntech probably will have to discount their panels more to sell
them, putting downward pressure on market pricing.”  Volatility Jumps  Suntech’s American depositary receipts have tumbled 72
percent this year, the  biggest decline  on the China-US gauge.
LDK, which has lost money since the second quarter of 2011, sank
14 percent this week.  Annualized volatility on Suntech’s ADR reached 143, the
most among companies on the China-US gauge, while the level for
LDK was 101, according to Bloomberg calculations.  Suntech, based in Wuxi of China’s Jiangsu province, said
March 21 a local court accepted a lenders’ petition, pushing
Wuxi Suntech Power Co., its main operating subsidiary, into
insolvency, while production at the unit’s facilities will
continue during the debt restructuring period.  The company announced March 11 a forbearance deal with 63
percent of its bondholders, who agreed not to exercise their
rights until May 15. Not all the bondholders agreed to the deal
and some said they were never contacted by Suntech.  Credit Lines  LDK, the world’s second-largest maker of wafers with more
than $3.1 billion in debt, hired Citigroup Inc. in December to
help renegotiate its liabilities. The company said on Dec. 21
that it received enough consents from the bondholders of its
notes due in 2014 allowing it to take on more debt. On Jan. 31,
LDK said state-run China Development Bank Corp. approved a 440
million  yuan  ($71 million) loan to upgrade its Mahong
Polysilicon plant.  The company, which has yet to release its fourth-quarter
results, said Dec. 3 that net loss for the three months through
September widened 20 percent to $136.9 million.  Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s third-largest solar maker, slid
5.6 percent this week to a three-month low of $3.88, extending
its loss this year to 11 percent.  The company, based in Changzhou of Jiangsu province, said
in February fourth-quarter net loss widened sevenfold to $267
million in 2012. It received a total of $250 million in credit
lines from China Development Bank Corp. during the quarter and
had $1.29 billion in bank borrowings, according to its
statement.  Index Rallies  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. (YGE) , a solar maker based in
Baoding of China’s Hebei province, sank 12 percent this week to
$2.17 in New York, the lowest level since Dec. 12.  Trina’s volatility was 79 and Yingli’s 78 on annualized
basis.  The China-US gauge rallied 1 percent yesterday in New York
to 92.26, reversing a loss earlier in the week. The  iShares FTSE
China 25 Index Fund (FXI) , the largest Chinese  exchange-traded fund  in
the U.S., added 0.3 percent to $36.94 yesterday in New York,
trimming a second weekly slump to 1.3 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index (SPX)  climbed 0.7 percent to
1,556.89, paring its drop to 0.2 percent in the week.  SouFun Holdings Ltd. (SFUN)  jumped 5 percent yesterday to a three-
week high of $26.18, posting a weekly gain of 14 percent which
was the biggest since November.  Yanzhou Coal Mining Co. rebounded 2.4 percent to $14.11
yesterday, trimming its loss for the week to 3.5 percent. The
company, China’s fourth-largest coal miner, reported net income
of 6.22 billion yuan in 2012, exceeding the average 5.14 billion
yuan estimate of 26 analysts compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  slid 0.4 percent to
10,896.48 yesterday, extending its five-day loss to 1.1 percent,
the second straight weekly decline. The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) 
of domestic Chinese shares added 0.2 percent in its fourth day
of gains to 2,328.28. The gauge’s weekly jump of 2.2 percent was
the steepest since Feb. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
