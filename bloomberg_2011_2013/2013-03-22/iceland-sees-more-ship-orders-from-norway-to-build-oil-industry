Iceland , which issued its first oil
and gas exploration licenses this year, will probably order more
supply vessels from Norway as it seeks to become a hub for
explorers from Greenland to Jan Mayen.  Icelandic companies will probably follow oil-service
provider Fafnir Offshore’s 7.3 billion kronur ($59 million)
purchase of the country’s first platform supply vessel from
Norway’s Havyard Group announced this week, Foreign Minister
Ossur Skarphedinsson said.  “There are more parties that are interested,” he said in
an interview in Oslo today. “The head start that Norway has is
their amazing technology regarding offshore services. They have
something that the competitors don’t have that matters to
Iceland: they have experience in arctic circumstances.”  Iceland will seek to become an oil-service hub for
exploration in its northern waters, off  Norway ’s Arctic Jan
Mayen island and offshore Greenland, as the island recovers from
the 2008 banking meltdown that led to its worst recession in six
decades, Skarphedinsson said. The country already has some of
the necessary infrastructure on its northern and eastern coasts,
he said.  Iceland awarded its first two exploration licenses in the
Dreki area in January, and expects drilling to start as soon as
2017, Skarphedinsson said. Norway’s state-owned Petoro AS has a
25 percent stake in one of the permits.  To contact the reporter on this story:
