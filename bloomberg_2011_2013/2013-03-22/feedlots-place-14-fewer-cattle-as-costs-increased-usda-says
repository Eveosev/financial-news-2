U.S. feedlots placed 14 percent
fewer cattle in February compared to a year earlier -- a bigger
drop than expected -- as profit prospects and animal supplies
declined.  Feedlots purchased or placed 1.482 million young animals
last month, down from 1.714 million in February 2012, the U.S.
Department of Agriculture said today in a report. Eleven
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News forecast a 9.1 percent drop,
on average. Placements were the lowest for the month since the
government began tracking the figure in 1996. The feedlot herd
totaled 10.857 million as of March 1, down 7 percent from a year
earlier. Analysts expected a 6.4 percent decline.  Feedlots placed 1.6 percent more cattle in January than a
year earlier, which left fewer animals available for placement
in February, said Elaine Johnson, an analyst at
Cattlehedging.com. Corn, the main ingredient in livestock feed,
gained 14 percent in the 12 months through yesterday, raising
costs for feedlots. This will result in “slightly negative”
profit margins in 2013, Wells Fargo & Co. has forecast.  “Prospective feeding profits were nonexistent,” Johnson,
based in Westminster,  Colorado , said in an interview before the
report. “That tends to cool down that interest” in placing
animals, she said.  Feedlot operators typically buy year-old animals that weigh
500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds, called feeders. The
cattle are fattened on corn for about four to five months until
they weigh about 1,300 pounds, when they are sold to
meatpackers.  Feedlots sold about 1.638 million animals to meatpackers
last month, down 6.7 percent from a year earlier, the USDA said.
Analysts expected 7.1 percent decline, on average. February 2013
had one fewer weekday than the previous year.  Fattened cattle futures for June delivery fell 0.4 percent
to $1.215 a pound at 12:13 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. The price slumped 7.8 percent this year through
yesterday.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement rose less than 0.1
percent to $1.4055 a pound, and the commodity was down 8.9
percent in 2013 through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
