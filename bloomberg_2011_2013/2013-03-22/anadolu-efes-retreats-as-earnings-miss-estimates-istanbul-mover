Anadolu Efes Biracilik & Malt
Sanayii AS (AEFES)  fell the most in more than three weeks after Turkey’s
biggest brewer reported earnings that missed estimates.  Anadolu Efes retreated as much as 1.5 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Feb. 26, to 27.20 liras and traded at
27.40 liras as of 3:52 p.m. in Istanbul. Almost 136,000 shares
were traded, about half of the stock’s three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Istanbul
Stock Exchange National 100 index dropped 0.4 percent, extending
this week’s loss to 1.2 percent.  Net income rose 78 percent to 606.9 million liras ($334
million) in 2012, the Istanbul-based company said in a filing
with the Istanbul Stock Exchange after the market closed
yesterday. The figure missed the 660.3 million-lira average
estimate of 16 analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg. Net income for
the fourth quarter, at 25 million liras, also missed market
estimates, Melda Agirdas, an analyst at Ekspres Invest in
Istanbul, said in a research report.  While domestic operations were “strong and in line with
forecasts” in the fourth quarter, the earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization margin of international
operations was “lower than anticipated,” Agirdas said. That
was “the main reason behind the miss,” the analyst said.  A market share loss of 4 percentage points last year, down
to 82.6 percent, showed competition was also strong, Agirdas,
who has a hold recommendation and a price target of 28.7 liras
for the stock, said.  Anadolu Efes, which is 24 percent owned by  SABMiller Plc (SAB) ,
trades at 20.1 times estimated 12-month earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. That compares with 17.4 for  Heineken
NV (HEIA)  of the Netherlands, 16 for South Africa’s  Distell Group Ltd. (DST) 
and 18.2 for U.K.’s  Diageo Plc. (DGE)   Three of 24 analysts recommend buying the shares, while 18
say hold and three recommend selling, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
