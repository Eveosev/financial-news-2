Manchester United midfielder Nani
was suspended one game for his red card during a Champions
League match against Real  Madrid  and manager  Alex Ferguson  was
fined 8,500 pounds ($13,000) for failing to fulfill his media
obligations after that game.  European soccer’s governing body  UEFA  confirmed the
sanctions in a statement today after a meeting of its
disciplinary board.  Nani was sent off for a high challenge on Alvaro Arbeloa as
both contested the ball in the 56th minute of a 2-1 loss on
March 5 which eliminated United in the round of 16. The red card
carried an automatic suspension from United’s next European
match and UEFA decided there was no additional reason to
increase it.  Ferguson was incensed by the red card and skipped his post-
match press conference, sending assistant Mike Phelan in his
place.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
