Railway Pension Investments Ltd. ,
the British pension manager known as Railpen, plans to hire
about seven  hedge funds  this year to manage 450 million pounds
($683 million) in assets.  The move comes as London-based Railpen, which oversees an
18 billion-pound pension system for U.K. rail workers, seeks to
cut costs by shifting from investing exclusively in funds of
hedge funds, which typically charge fees in addition to those
levied by the hedge-fund managers themselves.  “We’ll end up with roughly half of our hedge-fund assets
in the fund of funds, and roughly half in direct hedge funds,”
Chief Investment Officer Keith Shepherd said in a telephone
interview.  Railpen invests about 1.6 billion pounds in hedge funds,
including 350 million pounds managed directly by three hedge
funds it hired in the past year. Another 1.3 billion pounds is
invested through two funds of hedge funds managers. Over the
rest of the year, that will be reduced to about 800 million
pounds, overseen by one fund of funds manager, Shepherd said.  Among the styles Railpen will consider, he said, are equity
market neutral -- in which a manager can bet on both rising and
falling stock prices -- and multistrategy funds, which invest in
a range of hedge-fund strategies. Railpen hired consulting firm
 Albourne Partners Ltd.  to help in the search.  To contact the reporter on this story:
