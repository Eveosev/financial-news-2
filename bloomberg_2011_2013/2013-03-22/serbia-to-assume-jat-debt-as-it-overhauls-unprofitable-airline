Serbia will take over about 170
million euros ($220 million) in liabilities of JAT Airways AD as
it seeks to revamp the unprofitable national carrier and renew
its  fleet .  The overhaul includes reducing JAT’s workforce of 1,300 and
adding six new aircraft to an aging fleet, Transportation
Minister Milutin Mrkonjic told reporters in Belgrade today.  “We believe JAT will be able to break even this year
without the debt burden” and after leasing four jets and two
turboprop planes in the coming months, Mrkonjic said. “The debt
will be assumed by the state.”  The Balkan country is considering selling JAT to Etihad
Airways PJSC, the third-biggest Gulf airline, Finance Minister
 Mladjan Dinkic  said Oct. 22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
