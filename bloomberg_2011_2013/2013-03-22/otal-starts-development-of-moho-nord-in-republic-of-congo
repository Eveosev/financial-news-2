Total SA ,  Europe ’s third-biggest
oil company, will start development of the $10 billion offshore
Moho Nord project in the Republic of Congo as part of a push to
raise production.  First oil is expected in 2015 and output will reach 140,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day in 2017, the Paris-based company
said today in a statement. Total operates the license with a
53.5 percent stake while  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  holds 31.5 percent and
Societe Nationale des Petroles du Congo has 15 percent.  “The launch enhances visibility on Total’s production
growth target,” Yves-Louis Darricarrere, head of upstream at
Total, said in the statement.  Total is seeking to raise output as much as 3 percent this
year by developing new fields and exploring more aggressively
for new reserves. Output fell 2 percent last year in part
because of a shutdown at the Elgin platform in the  North Sea  due
to a natural gas leak. The company is planning to start
production at five fields this year including Sulige, Angola LNG
and Kashagan.  Total is the Repubic of Congo’s biggest producer, operating
10 of the 22 fields that have been developed, accounting for 60
percent of national output, according to today’s statement.  The Moho Nord development is located about 75 kilometers
(47 miles) from Pointe-Noire in waters between 450 and 1,200
meters deep.  To contact the reporter on this story:
