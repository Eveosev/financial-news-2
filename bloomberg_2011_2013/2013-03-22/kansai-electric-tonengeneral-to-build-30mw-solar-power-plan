Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503)  and
 TonenGeneral Sekiyu K.K. (5012) , Japan’s second-largest refiner by
capacity, will build a 30-megawatt solar power station in
western Japan.  Kansai Electric’s energy management unit will construct and
operate the station to be built in Wakayama prefecture, the
companies said in a statement today. No financial terms were
disclosed.  The plant will be built on idle land owned by TonenGeneral,
which will be in charge of maintenance services, according to
the statement. The companies aim to start running the plant by
March 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
