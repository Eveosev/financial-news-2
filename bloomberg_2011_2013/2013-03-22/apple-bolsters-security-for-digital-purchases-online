Apple Inc. (AAPL)  beefed up security
features for customers buying applications, songs, videos and e-
books from the company’s digital stores.  The new two-step verification gives an added layer of
authentication for customers who choose to use it, Cupertino,
California-based Apple said today on its  website . After logging
in with a name and password, the user will receive a passcode,
sent as a text message to a preferred device, such as an iPhone.  As people put more private information online,  EBay Inc. (EBAY) ’s
PayPal,  Google Inc. (GOOG)  and  Facebook Inc. (FB)  have introduced similar
security tools. The vulnerability of Apple’s services came into
focus last year when Wired reporter Mat Honan had online
accounts, including one with Apple, hacked. He  wrote  about the
episode in a widely read piece for the technology magazine.  “Apple takes customer privacy very seriously, and two-step
verification is an even more robust process to ensure our users’
data remains protected,”  Natalie Kerris , a spokeswoman for
Apple, said in an interview.  Apple’s new feature, which is optional, applies to
purchases in the App Store, iTunes and the iBookstore, as well
as whenever a user attempts to reset an account’s password.  Honan wrote in his article that had he used the available
two-factor authentication for his Google account, which was also
compromised, the breach of his private information and account
passwords probably wouldn’t have happened.  To contact the reporter on this story:
