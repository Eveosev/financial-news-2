JPMorgan Chase & Co., the biggest
U.S. bank, clawed back more than $100 million in compensation
awards from company executives responsible for a $6.2 billion
loss at the chief investment office in London.  JPMorgan “invoked comprehensive clawbacks of previously
granted outstanding awards and/or repayment of previously vested
awards subject to clawbacks for those with primary
responsibility,” the New York-based bank said today in a
regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
