Belgian  business confidence 
unexpectedly fell to a 3 1/2-year low in March, mirroring a
decline in  Germany , as demand prospects worsened among
executives in all industries surveyed.  The confidence index for  Belgium  decreased to minus 15 from
minus 11 in February, the Brussels-based  National Bank of
Belgium  said today. That’s the lowest reading since September
2009. Economists had predicted a gain to minus 10.4, according
to the median of 13  forecasts  in a Bloomberg survey.  “In the business-related services, prospects regarding
general market demand deteriorated significantly and the current
level of activity was considered to be below normal,” the
central bank said in the statement. “In the manufacturing
industry, the downturn was especially due to a more unfavorable
assessment of stocks and to worsened demand expectations.”  The decline mirrors an unexpected retreat in German
business confidence, which fell for the first time in five
months in March, the Ifo institute in Munich said earlier today.
Belgian  consumer confidence  also plunged this month as concerns
about rising unemployment reached the highest level in more than
three years amid a worsening economic outlook.  To contact the reporter on this story:
