Vietnam ’s bonds rose, driving the
three-year yield to the lowest level in almost five years, on
speculation the central bank will reduce interest rates as
inflation slows. The dong was steady.  Some Vietnamese banks have cut local-currency deposit rates
to as low as 7.5 percent, Tuoi Tre newspaper reported yesterday.
The central bank in December lowered the cap on dong deposit
rates to 8 percent from 9 percent. Consumer prices in  Ho Chi
Minh City  dropped 0.29 percent this month from February, and
declined 0.21 percent in Hanoi, online newswire CafeF reported
March 20.  “Easing inflation will give room for the central bank to
lower interest rates further, so investors are buying bonds in
anticipation of rate cuts,” said Hoang Thanh Tam, head of the
fixed-income department at Vietnam Maritime Commercial Joint-
Stock Bank in Hanoi.  The three-year yield fell 13 basis points, or 0.13
percentage point, to 8.23 percent, the lowest since March 31,
2008, according to a daily fixing from lenders compiled by
Bloomberg. The yield dropped 22 basis points this week, the most
in two months.  The State Treasury sold 3 trillion dong ($143 million) of
three-year notes to yield 8.18 percent, and 3 trillion dong of
five-year securities at 8.84 percent yesterday, according to the
Hanoi Stock Exchange website. Those rates compared with 8.45
percent and 9.2 percent, respectively, at last week’s auction.  Rate Cuts  The central bank cut  interest rates  six times last year,
with the latest reduction taking effect Dec. 24. The refinancing
and discount rates were each cut by 1 percentage point to 9
percent and 7 percent, respectively.  Vietnam’s  inflation  eased in February, with consumer prices
climbing 7.02 percent from a year earlier after rising 7.07
percent in January, according to data from the General
Statistics Office in Hanoi.  The dong traded at 20,943 per dollar as of 3:30 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency was little changed from 20,950 at the end of
last week.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since December 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the daily fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
