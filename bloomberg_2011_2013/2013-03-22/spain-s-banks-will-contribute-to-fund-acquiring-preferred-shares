Spain  will require the country’s
banks to contribute as much as a combined 2 billion euros ($2.6
billion) to help absorb the stock of two nationalized lenders
after a swap of junior debt for shares.  The money will go to the Spain’s deposit-guarantee fund and
will be used to help acquire stock issued in exchange for
preferred shares sold to customers of Catalunya Banc and
Novagalicia Banco, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said at a
press conference today in  Madrid .  Under the terms of a European bailout for Spain’s banking
system approved last year, subordinated debt and preferred
shares of banks that took state aid must be exchanged for stock.
The government seeks to increase the liquidity of Catalunya Banc
and Novagalicia Banco because they aren’t listed, de Guindos
said.  The minister has been critical of the practice whereby
Spanish banks raised capital by selling debt instruments
including preferred stock to consumer-banking clients who in
many cases thought they were putting their money in deposits.  Banks must make 40 percent of their contribution to the
deposit-guarantee fund no later than 20 days from the end of
this year, the  Economy Ministry  said today in a statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
