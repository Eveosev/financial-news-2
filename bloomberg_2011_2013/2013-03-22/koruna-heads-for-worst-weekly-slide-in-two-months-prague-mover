The koruna depreciated, set for its
biggest weekly fall in more than two months, as prospects
worsened for the  Czech Republic ’s export-led recovery from
recession.  The currency slid to the lowest level in nine months versus
the euro after data published today showed an unexpected
deterioration in business sentiment in  Germany , the biggest
buyer of Czech exports. That adds to a surprise drop in the
manufacturing and services indexes for the euro area released
yesterday and concern that Cyprus bailout talks may fail.  “The series of bad news from the euro zone” is weighing
on the koruna, Jan Cermak and Jan Bures, analysts at CSOB AS in
 Prague , wrote in a report to clients today.  The Czech currency weakened 0.2 percent to 25.848 per euro
by 2:40 p.m. in Prague, extending this year’s loss to 2.9
percent. A close at that level would mark a 1 percent weekly
retreat, the steepest since the five days ended Jan. 4.  “If the situation in Cyprus results in an unmanaged exit
from the  euro zone , the koruna may stay under pressure and
attack 26 per euro,” the analysts said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
