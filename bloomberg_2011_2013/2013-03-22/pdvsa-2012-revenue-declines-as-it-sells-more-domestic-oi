Petroleos de Venezuela SA ’s sales
declined less than 1 percent last year as the state-owned  oil
company  sold more crude in its home nation instead of fetching
higher prices for exports, Oil Minister  Rafael Ramirez  said.  PDVSA, as the company is known, had revenue of $124.4
billion in 2012, down from $124.8 billion in 2011, Ramirez told
reporters in Caracas today. The company’s net income decreased
to $4.2 billion last year from $4.5 billion. PDVSA will publish
2012 financial results on March 25, said Ramirez, who is also
the company’s president.  The decline in revenue is “not important,” he said.
“PDVSA’s results guarantee the stability of the Venezuelan
economy.”  Oil accounts for 96 percent of  Venezuela ’s dollar earnings.
The nation, holder of the world’s largest crude reserves, is
preparing for elections next month to replace President  Hugo
Chavez , who died March 5 after 14 years in office.  The state oil company has “clarified” issues with
 Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB) , a services provider, and field partners OAO
Lukoil and India’s Oil & Natural Gas Corp., Ramirez said.  The state company established a financial “mechanism”
with Schlumberger to work out financial issues, Ramirez said.
Schlumberger Chief Executive Officer Paal Kibsgaard said this
week that the company was reducing work in Venezuela because of
trouble getting paid.  PDVSA increased the amount it owes to oil-services
companies by 35 percent last year, Ramirez said.  Lukoil ‘Misunderstanding’  Russian oil company Lukoil said reports it criticized
Venezuela’s investment environment were a “misunderstanding,”
Ramirez said, reading from what he said was a letter from Andrei Kuzyaev, president of Lukoil’s overseas unit. Lukoil will again
be able to operate in the country, Ramirez said.  Ramirez also said he received a “communication” from
 India ’s ONGC clarifying issues between the companies.  PDVSA invested $25 billion last year and its assets
increased from $98 billion in 2011 to $115 billion in 2012,
Ramirez said.  Venezuela’s oil exports  averaged  $103.42 a barrel last year
from $101.06 in 2011, according to the Oil Ministry’s website.
PDVSA sells oil on domestic markets for less than the export
price.  To contact the reporters on this story:
