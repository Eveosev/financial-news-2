Techtronic Industries Co. (669) , maker of
Ryobi power tools and Hoover vacuum cleaners, expects sales to
double in five years aided by a rebound in the U.S. economy and
the introduction of new products.  “We can double the company’s size over the next five years
easily,” Chief executive officer Joseph Galli Jr. said in an
interview today. The Hong Kong-based company whose brands also
included Milwaukee power tools, plans to roll out 350 new
products globally this year, hoping to tap an economic recovery
in the U.S.  New  residential construction  in the U.S. continued to rise
in February and permits for future construction climbed to the
highest level in almost five years, signaling a rebound in the
world’s largest economy. The company gets more than 70 percent
of revenue from  North America .  Techtronic yesterday reported a 32 percent jump in profit
for the year ended in December. Net income rose to $201 million
from $152 million a year ago. Sales increased 5 percent to $3.85
billion.  The company, whose competitors including  Stanley Black &
Decker Inc. (SWK)  and Japan’s  Makita Corp. (6586) , plans to expand into new
markets such as Eastern Europe and the Middle East.  It expects sales to grow at a “strong single-digit” pace
this year, while sales of its Milwaukee power equipment will
deliver “strong double-digit” growth, Galli said.  Techtronic rose 4.1 percent to close at HK$18.42, while the
benchmark Hang Seng Index lost 0.5 percent. The stock has
climbed 91 percent in the last 12 months, outperforming the  Hang
Seng Index ’s 5.8 percent gain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
