Italian and Spanish bonds advanced
for a third day amid signs Cyprus is moving closer to an
agreement that will help it win an international bailout.  Italian securities extended a weekly gain as Averof Neofytou, deputy president of Cyprus’s ruling Disy party, said
lawmakers will reach a deal in the next few hours. The bonds of
so-called peripheral nations slid at the start of this week as
Cyprus sought an unprecedented tax on bank deposits, threatening
to reignite  Europe ’s debt crisis. Benchmark German 10-year bunds
fell, pushing the yield up from an 11-week low.  “The market is treating the dip on Monday and Tuesday
after the Cyprus fallout as a buying opportunity,” said  Michael Leister , an interest-rates analyst at Commerzbank AG in  London .
“In the current environment it’s unlikely we’ll continue these
moves in a straight line but if we manage to get an agreement in
Cyprus over the weekend then there’s further room for Spain and
 Italy  to perform.”  Italian 10-year bond yields fell seven basis points, or
0.07 percentage point, to 4.52 percent at 4:59 p.m. London time,
headed for a weekly drop of eight basis points. The 5.5 percent
securities maturing in November 2022 rose 0.565, or 5.65 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,299) face amount, to 107.985.  Spanish 10-year yields declined three basis points to 4.85
percent, after falling 16 basis points over the past two days.  Italian bonds stayed higher after the nation’s President
Giorgio Napolitano asked Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi
Bersani to try to form a government, a month after inconclusive
elections.  Cyprus Deadlock  Cyprus is seeking to overcome a deadlock after lawmakers
rejected a 5.8 billion-euro levy on  bank deposits  imposed by the
European Union as a condition for a 10 billion-euro rescue. The
 European Central Bank  said it will cut emergency funds to banks
in the Mediterranean nation on March 25 unless a bailout program
with the EU and International Monetary Fund is in place.  “The political dimension in the complexity of the
situation in Cyprus is increasingly on the market’s radar
screens,” said Elwin de Groot, a market economist at Rabobank
Nederland in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “It seems we’re in for a
volatile ride today and this perhaps extending into next week.”  Germany ’s 10-year bunds rose earlier as a report showed
business confidence unexpectedly declined in March. The 10-year
yield added one basis point to 1.38 percent, after falling to
1.34 percent, the lowest since Jan. 2.  Business Sentiment  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
 index , based on a survey of 7,000 executives, fell to 106.7 from
107.4 in February. Economists predicted an increase to 107.8,
according to the median of 42 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey.  Austria ’s 10-year  bond yield  rose two basis points to 1.68
percent, after falling to 1.634 percent, the least since
Bloomberg began compiling the data in 1993.  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Italy and Austria, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Italian bonds have handed investors a return of 8 percent
in the 12 months through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Spanish securities gained 9 percent and
German bunds earned 5.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
