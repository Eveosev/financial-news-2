Former supermodel Iman wore a flaming-red design by her old friend Stephen Burrows last night at the Museum of the City of New York.  The wife of David Bowie nearly eclipsed the man of the hour at the party for “Stephen Burrows: When Fashion Danced,” a retrospective of his work from 1968 to 1983, opening today.  Wearing sunglasses throughout the evening, Burrows was asked if he started the trend before Vogue Editor Anna Wintour.  “Maybe,” he said, adding that he does it to avoid squinting. Dressed all in black, he held court in a room full of mannequins wearing his colorful designs, while a gaggle of flamboyantly turned-out fashion followers hustled to get a photo.  Fashion designers “represent their time,” said Catherine Malandrino, among the hundreds of guests. Burrows’s career reflected all that is “fun” about clothes, she said.  Exhibition curator Daniela Morera said Manhattan should be remembered in the 1970s not as a city riddled with a “fiscal crisis,” but as an island teeming with “creativity and dynamism.”  Given Burrows’s popularity among denizens of Studio 54, the party had a disco theme, with Marvin Gaye tunes pumping and psychedelic colors everywhere.  Guests were treated to the Bullseye cocktail, a prosecco- and-strawberries concoction in honor of the exhibition’s sponsor,  Target Corp. (TGT)  BET Networks, the media sponsor, was represented by its chairman and chief executive, Debra Lee.  Red-and-pink tote bags designed by Burrows specifically for the party hung from the ceiling, waiting for guests to take them home.  Susan Henshaw Jones, president of the museum, wore one like a messenger bag.  Jill Biden  In Washington Wednesday night, Jill Biden stepped out in style at Villa Firenze, the residence of Italian Ambassador Claudio Bisogniero.  Wearing a backless cocktail dress and towering heels, the wife of the vice president turned heads in a room full of fashion leaders such as Elle magazine’s editor-in-chief, Robbie Myers, and Christophe de Pous, the president of Gucci North America.  The occasion was a small dinner party sponsored by Elle and Gucci to salute Biden and nine other Washington luminaries such as Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, New York Democrat, President  Barack Obama ’s deputy chief of staff, Alyssa Mastromonaco, and Susan Molinari, vice president of public policy for  Google Inc. (GOOG)   Heather Podesta  Other guests included lobbyist Heather Podesta and Melissa Maxfield, senior vice president for federal-government affairs at  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA) , both in Gucci for the occasion, and Juleanna Glover, founding principal of the Ashcroft Group Llc.  Also seated at long tables, where Cafe Milano provided a two-course meal that included sea bass, were Amy Dacey, executive director of Emily’s List, and Jane Harman, president and chief executive of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars.
