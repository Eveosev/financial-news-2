OAO  TNK-BP Holding (TNBP)  sank to a record
low as OAO Rosneft said it won’t buy minority stakes after
sealing a $55 billion acquisition of the Russian oil producer’s
parent.  Shares in the Moscow-traded unit of the former  BP Plc (BP/)  joint
venture plunged 14 percent, the most in five months, to 49
rubles by 12:43 p.m. in Moscow, the lowest since December 2010
when the shares were listed. The amount traded was 1.5 million
shares, equivalent to about 2.7 times the three-month average.  Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer doesn’t plan to buy
TNK-BP Holding’s minority stakes, Rosneft Chairman  Igor Sechin ,
said today in an interview broadcast by national television
channel Rossiya 24, after completing the biggest takeover in
Russian history yesterday.  “Those who had any illusions about the minority stakes’
buyout are selling the stock today,”  Alexei Kokin , an analyst
at UralSib Capital, said by phone from Moscow. “When Sechin
says something like this, the market is reacting in the most
pessimistic way.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
