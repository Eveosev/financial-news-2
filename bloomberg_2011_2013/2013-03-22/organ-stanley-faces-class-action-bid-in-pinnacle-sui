A group of Singapore investors
asked to sue  Morgan Stanley (MS)  on behalf of all entities that lost
money in synthetic collateralized debt obligations allegedly
rigged to fare poorly.  Singapore Government Staff Credit Cooperative Society Ltd .
and several individuals filed papers today in Manhattan federal
court seeking establish a class of all investors in the CDOs
issued from Aug. 1, 2006, to the end of 2007.  Investors in Morgan Stanley’s  Pinnacle Notes  lost
$154.7 million reinvested by the bank into CDOs tied to
companies such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. and Washington Mutual Inc., plaintiffs alleged in
their lawsuit. Morgan Stanley meanwhile set up a swap that
allowed it to profit when the CDOs failed, according to the
suit.  “The crux of the action is that defendants engaged in a
uniform scheme to defraud the Pinnacle Notes investors,” the
Singapore plaintiffs said in a court filing today. “When the
underlying assets suffered losses, as intended, the investors’
funds were ’swapped’ to defendants.”  The Singapore investors filed their suit in October 2010
accusing the bank of fraud, negligent misrepresentation and
other claims. Morgan Stanley is the largest U.S. wealth
management firm by market capitalization.  The case is Dandong v. Pinnacle Performance Ltd., 10-cv-
08086, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York
( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
