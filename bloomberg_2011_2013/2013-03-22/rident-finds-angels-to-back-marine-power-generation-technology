Trident Energy Ltd., a U.K. marine
energy developer, raised about 440,000 pounds ($668,000) from
so-called angel investors to develop its generation system.  The  London  Business Angels network and Angel CoFund offered
the funds, Trident said today in a  statement  on its website. The
company, based in London, will use the money to test a prototype
at sea as it moves its technology toward commercial operations.  The PowerPod can be added to devices that convert wave and
tidal-energy into electricity and be used to generate power for
offshore infrastructure such as oil platforms. Trident expects
to test its technology off western  Scotland  for about a year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
