Slovenia’s  new government  needs to
fix the country’s troubled banks and complete an overhaul of the
economy to avoid a bailout, Fitch Ratings said.  Slovenia “will be able to avoid requesting international
financial assistance” if the two-day-old Cabinet of Premier
Alenka Bratusek maintains investor confidence and the ability to
borrow “at reasonable terms” while implementing legislation to
set up a so-called bad bank, Matteo Napolitano, director at
Fitch in  London , wrote in the report released today.  “Failure to tackle these issues in a timely manner would
increase pressure on the A- sovereign rating,” Napolitano said.
It’s unclear what final shape the bad-lender plan will take as
“asset quality continues to deteriorate, banks’ capital buffers
are thinning and implementation risks remain.”  The government vowed to stick with a bank-recapitalization
plan of as much as 4 billion euros ($5.2 billion), though with
unspecified modifications, as surging bad loans at lenders such
as Nova Ljubljanska Banka d.d. fuel investor concern that the
country may require a rescue. Mounting bad loans and a poor
 economic outlook  make the recapitalization plan more urgent,
according to Fitch.  Weak domestic consumption, contracting credit and indebted
companies, along with slumping demand in main trading partners
such as Germany and  Italy , continue to weigh on the Alpine
nation’s economy, it said. Gross domestic product, which fell an
annual 2.3 percent last year, will drop an estimated 1.6 percent
this year, the ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
