Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  won
approval from the City of London borough council for a plan to
develop an office building that may become its new European
headquarters.  Goldman Sachs’ affiliates Farringdon Street Partners Ltd.
and Farringdon Street (Nominee) Ltd. plan to demolish the
existing properties and develop a new Kohn Pedersen Fox-designed
glass-fronted and curved building on the site. Goldman didn’t
immediately return phone calls and an e-mail seeking comment.  The building at 70 Farringdon Street and Shoe Lane will
have about 111,300 square meters (1.2 million square feet) of
internal  office space , according to the application letter. It’s
about a minute’s walk from Goldman’s current headquarters
buildings on Fleet Street and construction work is set to
begin “almost immediately,”  City of London  planning officer
Peter Rees said at today’s meeting.  “It’s a banking factory. Let’s make no bones about it,”
Rees told the borough’s members. “If there’s an area where
we’re going to accommodate groundscrapers this is probably the
best” place, he said.  Goldman Sachs, the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, was
given permission in September to move a set of protected murals
from the building, helping to clear the way for the
redevelopment.  The New York-based investment bank’s London Property unit
had assets of 73.7 million pounds ($112 million) through
December 2011 and paid 103.4 million pounds for a development
site last year, according to a filing with  Companies House  in
August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
