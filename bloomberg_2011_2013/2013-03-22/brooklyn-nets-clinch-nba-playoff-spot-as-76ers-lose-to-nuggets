The  Brooklyn  Nets clinched a
National Basketball Association playoff spot when the
Philadelphia 76ers lost to the Denver Nuggets 101-100.  The Nets, who last made the playoffs in the 2006-07 season,
are in their first season in Brooklyn after a move from New
Jersey.  “Making the playoffs is great for our fans and the
organization,” said Nets General Manager Billy King in an e-
mail to the New York Post. “Now we need to continue getting
better as a team.”  The Nets join the Indiana Pacers, Miami Heat, Oklahoma City
Thunder, Nuggets and San Antonio Spurs in claiming a postseason
berth.  The Nets (40-28) are fourth in the Eastern Conference and
second in the conference’s Atlantic Division, one game behind
the  New York  Knicks.  Brooklyn travels to the Los Angeles Clippers tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
