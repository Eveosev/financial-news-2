BlackBerry (BBRY) , which is releasing its
new Z10 phone in the U.S. today, tumbled the most in more than a
month in  New York  trading after analysts raised concerns that
the devices are getting a lukewarm response.  The  shares  fell 7.7 percent to $14.91, the biggest drop
since Feb. 13. Before today’s drop, the stock had climbed 36
percent this year, lifted by optimism that the company’s new
lineup will fuel a turnaround.  Ahead of the Z10’s U.S. debut, Deutsche Bank AG analyst
checked inventory in the U.K. and  Canada , where the phone is
already available. The findings suggest that sales have been
slow and store employees aren’t promoting the devices, the firm
said in a report.  “We contacted 60 stores in total and not one was sold
out,” Deutsche Bank said in the report. “In Canada, only a few
recommended the Z10 unsolicited.”  At an  AT&T Inc. (T)  store in midtown  Manhattan  this morning,
there were no lines of shoppers waiting for the new BlackBerry
or signage promoting the release. Most buyers of the phone will
probably be corporate customers, rather than consumers, said
Jorge Garcia, a sales representative at the shop on Lexington
Avenue.  “Most of the corporate clients are asking for
BlackBerrys,” said Garcia, who expects about 90 percent of the
new phone’s sales to come from those customers, with 10 percent
coming from walk-in shoppers. He said he wasn’t expecting to get
many units of the Z10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
