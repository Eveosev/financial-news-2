Japan ’s demand for copper and
copper-alloy fabricated products may gain 5.4 percent in the
year starting in April on a weaker yen and government stimulus.  Demand for products, including sheets and tubes, may rise
to 800,500 metric tons, compared with 759,500 tons this fiscal
year, the Japan Copper & Brass  Association  said today, citing
preliminary data.  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said yesterday he’s
confident of achieving a 2 percent inflation target, rebutting
doubters who predict his efforts will fail as he prepares to
strengthen monetary stimulus. Japan yesterday reported its
longest run of  trade deficits  in three decades as exports fell
in February and import costs rose on a weaker yen and an extra
reliance on fossil fuels because of nuclear-plant shutdowns.  “We’ll probably see a full-scale recovery in demand after
this summer,” said Keizo Tani, association research manager.
“The yen’s weakness will help the export industry and the
government’s efforts to revive growth will improve overall
sentiment in the domestic market.”  Production declined 4.8 percent to 61,010 tons in February
from a year earlier, slumping for a fourth month, the industry
group said. In January, output totaled 56,637 tons, down 5.4
percent from a year ago.  “Benefits from the weaker yen have yet to be felt in the
industry,” Tani said, referring to the monthly output data.  The Japanese currency has fallen 9.4 percent against the
dollar this year amid Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s calls for
aggressive monetary easing to end deflation. The yen touched
96.71 on March 12, the weakest level since August 2009.  Copper wire and cable shipments, including exports and
domestic business, fell 6.2 percent to 55,700 tons in February
from a year earlier, dropping for a third month, the  Japanese
Electric Wire & Cable Makers’ Association  said on March 19. The
group will issue a forecast for the next fiscal year on March 25.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange rose 0.5 percent to $7,620 a ton at 12:23 p.m. in  Tokyo .
The metal has declined 3.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
