Tiger Woods trails co-leaders Bill Haas and Justin Rose by four shots heading into the third round
of the Arnold Palmer Invitational, where he is seeking his
eighth win at the event and a return to golf’s No. 1 ranking.  Woods shot a 2-under 70 yesterday at Bay Hill Club & Lodge
in Orlando, Florida, and is at 5 under halfway through the
tournament.  Haas had a 6-under-par 66 yesterday to tie Rose, the first-
round leader, who had a 2-under 70 in the second round. Both are
at 9 under entering the weekend. John Huh is at 8 under, three
golfers are at 6 under and Woods is among three at 5 under.  A victory would vault Woods past Northern Ireland’s Rory McIlroy to the top of the  Official World Golf Ranking  for the
first time in 2 1/2 years. Woods has won twice this year on the
PGA Tour and five times in his past 19 starts on the world’s
richest golf tour. An eighth title at Bay Hill also would tie
him with Sam Snead for the most victories at a single PGA Tour
event.  To contact the reporter on this story:
