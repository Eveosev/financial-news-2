Florida  Gulf Coast University
turned its debut at the men’s college basketball national
tournament into the biggest upset of the 2013 championship.  Fifteenth-seeded Florida Gulf Coast won 78-68 against
Georgetown, the seventh time since 1985 that a regional No. 2
seed has lost its opening game at the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament.  Sherwood Brown had 24 points in yesterday’s game at
Philadelphia for Florida Gulf Coast, which was established as a
school in 1991 and is in its second year of postseason
eligibility in college basketball’s top division.  “I think we became discombobulated at the defensive end,”
Georgetown coach John Thompson III said at a news conference.
“There are a lot of things that we have been very good at all
year that we were not good at tonight.”  The Round of 32 begins today with 14th-seeded Harvard,
which got its first NCAA win two nights ago with an upset
victory against  New Mexico , taking on No. 6  Arizona . Regional
top seeds Gonzaga and Louisville also are in action today.  Bernard Thompson added 23 points for Florida Gulf Coast
(25-10), which built a 19-point lead midway through the second
half and then held off a Georgetown rally. Markel Starks had 23
points for the Hoyas (25-7).  Florida Gulf Coast moved on to a game tomorrow against
seventh-seeded San Diego State, a 70-55 winner against  Oklahoma .  “It’s just a great feeling, just excited,” Bernard
Thompson said in a news conference. “I don’t really know what
to do still with myself.”  Indiana Wins  Yogi Ferrell scored the first nine points of the game and
 Indiana University , the top seed in the East region, went on to
an 83-62 defeat of James Madison University. Jeff Withey had
seven blocks for Kansas, seeded first in the South, which
advanced with a 64-57 win against Western Kentucky and next
faces No. 8 North Carolina, a 78-71 winner against Villanova.  Regional No. 2 seeds Duke, Miami and  Ohio  State had
comfortable wins yesterday on the second day of play in the
tournament’s Round of 64.  Ferrell, a freshman guard, finished with 16 points, eight
rebounds and six assists for the Hoosiers (28-6), who led by 21
points at halftime.  Indiana  will play Temple in the Round of 32.  Seth Curry scored 26 points and Mason Plumlee added 23 as
Duke, seeded No. 2 in the Midwest region, beat  Albany  73-61.
Miami, the East’s No. 2 seed, topped Pacific 78-49 and next will
play No. 7 Illinois, a 57-49 winner against Colorado. Ohio
State, the West’s second seed, defeated Iona 95-70 and moved on
to face No. 10 Iowa State, which ousted  Notre Dame  76-58.  Duke Advances  Duke shot 58.7 percent from the field in Philadelphia
against the 15th-seeded Great Danes from  New York ’s capital
city. Duke advances to play No. 7 seed Creighton, which beat
10th-seeded Cincinnati 67-63.  The Blue Devils were also a No. 2 seed last year when they
lost their tournament-opening game to 15th-seeded Lehigh.  Florida, seeded third in the South, strolled to a 79-47 win
against Northwestern State and next will play 11th-seeded
 Minnesota  after its 83-63 defeat of UCLA.  La Salle, a No. 13 seed in the West, gave up a 19-point
lead to fourth-seeded Kansas State before surviving with a 63-61
win and next will play Mississippi -- which came back to beat
 Wisconsin  57-46, the third victory so far this year for a No. 12
seed over a No. 5.  Junior guard Marshall Henderson scored a game-high 19
points as the Rebels knocked out Wisconsin in  Kansas City ,
 Missouri . The Badgers led 25-22 at halftime and by six with
about 11 minutes remaining.  La Salle Survives  La Salle advanced despite being outscored 35-19 in the
second half.  Temple, the No. 9 seed in the East, beat eighth-seeded
 North Carolina  State 76-72. Senior guard Khalif Wyatt scored 31
points for Temple, including two free throws that put the game
out of reach with 2.2 seconds remaining in Dayton, Ohio. Lorenzo
Brown scored 22 for the Wolfpack and C.J. Leslie added 20.  The NCAA championship game will be played April 8 in
