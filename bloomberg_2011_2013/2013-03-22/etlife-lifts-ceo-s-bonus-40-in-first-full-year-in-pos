MetLife Inc. (MET)  raised  Steven Kandarian ’s bonus 40 percent in his first full year as chief
executive officer of the largest U.S. life insurer.  The bonus of $4.2 million last year compares with $3
million in 2011, the company said today in a regulatory filing.
He became CEO in May of 2011, after previously serving as chief
investment officer. Kandarian, 61, received total compensation
of $13.7 million, up from $10.6 million in 2011 and $4.2 million
in 2010.  MetLife boosted operating earnings, a measure of profit
that excludes some investment results, by 22 percent last year.
Shares of the New York-based firm added 5.6 percent in 2012,
trailing behind Prudential Financial Inc., the second-largest
U.S. life insurer, which gained 6.4 percent.  William Wheeler, 51, head of MetLife’s Americas unit, the
company’s largest, got a $1.75 million bonus, $250,000 less than
in 2011 or 2010, when he was chief financial officer. Steven Goulart, 54, the chief investment officer, received a $1.2
million bonus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
