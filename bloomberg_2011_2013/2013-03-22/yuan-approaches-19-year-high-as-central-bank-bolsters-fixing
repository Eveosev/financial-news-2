The yuan traded near a 19-year high
as the People’s Bank of China boosted the currency’s reference
rate to the strongest level in more than two months amid
optimism the economy is improving.  The central bank raised the daily  fixing  0.03 percent to
6.2711 per dollar today, the highest level since Jan. 15. A
preliminary reading for Chinese manufacturing this month was
51.7, according to a report yesterday from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. That compares with the median estimate of 50.8
in a Bloomberg survey and a final reading of 50.4 in February.
Premier Li Keqiang took office last week.  “There’s an increase in yuan demand on expectations the
new leadership will implement policies to safeguard growth and
allow more foreign investment in domestic markets,” said Banny Lam, co-head of research at Agricultural Bank of China
International Securities Ltd., a subsidiary of the nation’s
third-largest bank. Lam expects the  yuan  to gain 2 percent this
year, after a 1 percent advance in 2012.  The yuan rose 0.03 percent to close at 6.2122 per dollar in
 Shanghai , prices from China Foreign Exchange Trade System show.
It touched 6.2113 on March 20, the strongest level since the
government unified the official and market rates at the end of
1993. The currency advanced for a fourth week with a 0.02
percent gain and traded at a 0.95 percent premium to the fixing,
near its 1 percent daily trading limit.  The yuan is “moderately undervalued,” Markus Rodlauer,
International Monetary Fund’s China mission chief, said
yesterday in a Bloomberg TV interview.  Offshore Market  China and  Brazil  have reached consensus on 190 billion yuan
($31 billion) of currency swaps, Foreign Ministry spokesman Hong
Lei said in Beijing today. A deal on the swap will be signed
“soon,” Hong said.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the Chinese currency was
steady at 6.2060 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It
has dropped 0.06 percent since March 15, snapping a three-week
advance. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards climbed 0.05
percent today to 6.3060, paring a weekly loss to 0.06 percent.
The contracts traded at a 1.5 percent discount to the spot rate
in Shanghai.  One-month implied volatility in the onshore yuan, a measure
of expected moves in the exchange rate used to price options,
gained three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.25
percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
