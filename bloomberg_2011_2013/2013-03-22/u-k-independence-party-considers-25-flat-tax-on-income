The leadership of the U.K.
Independence Party, which beat  David Cameron ’s Conservatives
into third place in a special election last month, proposed
advocating a 25 percent flat tax on all income over 13,000
pounds ($19,800) a year.  The policy would mean someone earning 30,000 pounds a year
would pay 4,250 pounds in tax. At the moment, 7,066 pounds in
tax and national insurance is levied on such a salary.  Godfrey
Bloom , a UKIP member of the European Parliament who’s in charge
of drawing up the party’s tax policy, said a flat tax would not
reduce government revenue.  “We would argue that you wouldn’t find any difference in
the tax take, because nobody on a high income pays it now,” he
said in a telephone interview. “We would expect the tax take to
stay the same or perhaps even increase.”  UKIP ’s anti-immigration, anti-European Union message helped
it come second behind the Liberal Democrats in the Feb. 28
Eastleigh by-election to the House of Commons. Party members at
their spring conference in Exeter, western  England , tomorrow
will also hear proposals to load welfare payments onto  debit
cards  that couldn’t be used to pay for cigarettes, alcohol or
satellite television. UKIP members will vote on these policies
later in the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
