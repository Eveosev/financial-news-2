Brazil ’s  consumer prices  in mid-
March rose less than economists forecast, easing pressure on the
central bank to raise rates next month. Swap rates fell.  Prices as measured by the IPCA-15  price index  rose 0.49
percent in the month through mid-March, the national statistics
agency said in a report published on its website. That was less
than the 0.53 percent median  estimate  from 33 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Annual  inflation  accelerated to 6.43
percent from 6.18 percent in mid-February.  The central bank this month held its key rate at a record
low for the third straight meeting, in keeping with government
efforts to spur growth. Since then, reports on  industrial 
output,  retail  sales and job  creation  all surpassed economists’
forecasts. Consumer price increases are running higher than in
all major Latin American economies except Venezuela and
Argentina, and inflation near the top limit of the central
bank’s target range is testing its willingness to keep the rate
at 7.25 percent in April.  The bank targets inflation of 4.5 percent, plus or minus
two percentage points.  “Inflation will not hinder the country’s consumption or
growth,” Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told a Senate committee
yesterday. Mantega said inflation is “under control.”  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 7.77 percent at 9:21 a.m. local time. The
real strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.0072 per  U.S. dollar .  Inflation was led by a 1.4 percent jump in food and
beverage prices, down from 1.74 percent last month, and a 0.51
percent increase in personal expenses. Housing prices fell 0.7
percent, compared with a 2.17 percent decline last month.  Economists in the latest central bank survey decreased
their 2013 inflation forecast to 5.73 percent from 5.82 percent.
They forecast growth of 3.03 percent this year, after the
economy expanded 0.9 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
