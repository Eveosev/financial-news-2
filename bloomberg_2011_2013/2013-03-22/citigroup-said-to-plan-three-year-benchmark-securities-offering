Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. lender by assets, sold $1.5 billion of three-year bonds in
a two-part sale.  The bank raised $850 million of 1.3 percent notes to yield
96 basis points more than similar-maturity Treasuries and $650
million of floating-rate securities that yield 79 basis points
more than the three-month London interbank offered rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The New York-based bank, which has about  $25.1 billion  of
debt coming due this year, issued three-year securities in
January, offering $1.75 billion of 1.25 percent notes at a
relative yield of 95 basis points, Bloomberg data show. Those
securities traded yesterday at 100.6 cents on the dollar to
yield 1.03 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  To contact the reporter on this story:
