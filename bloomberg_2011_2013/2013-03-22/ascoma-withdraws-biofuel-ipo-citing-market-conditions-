Mascoma Corp. (MCM) , a closely held
biofuel company backed by billionaire Vinod Khosla, withdrew its
registration for a planned initial public offering to raise as
much as $100 million.  “The company has determined at this time not to proceed
with the offering due to market conditions,” it said today in a
filing.  Mascoma is the fourth biofuel company to cancel or delay
indefinitely an initial share sale since last year. Enerkem Inc.
canceled its planned IPO in April, followed by Fulcrum BioEnergy
Inc. in November, and Coskata Inc. shelved its deal in July.  The company, based on Lebanon, New Hampshire, is developing
genetically modified yeast and bacteria that produce enzymes to
break down plant sugars and ferment them into ethanol.  Mascoma planned to use the proceeds from the offering to
develop its production process and expand sales in the corn-
based ethanol industry. It is also planning to build two
manufacturing plants in Michigan and  Alberta ,  Canada , to convert
wood into ethanol.  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  is backing the Michigan
project.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  & Co., UBS Securities, Credit Suisse
Securities LLC, Robert W. Baird & Co. and Cannacord Genuity Inc.
were the underwriters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
