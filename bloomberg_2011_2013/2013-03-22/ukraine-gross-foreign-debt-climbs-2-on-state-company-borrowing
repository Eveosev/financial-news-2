Ukraine’s gross foreign debt grew 2
percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months as
government and corporate borrowing increased.  Gross foreign debt rose to $135 billion as of Jan. 1 from
$132.4 billion on Oct. 1, the  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy , based
in the capital, Kiev, said late yesterday on its website. That’s
equal to 76.7 percent of gross domestic product, it said.  Almost 75 percent of the total debt was denominated in
dollars, the central bank said.  Short-term debt that matures in next 12 months rose 1.3
percent to $60.9 billion in the October-December period,
according to the central bank.  -- Editors: Alan Crosby, Pawel Kozlowski  To contact the reporter on this story:
