Gasoline fluctuated as  Brent crude 
weakened versus West Texas Intermediate oil amid debate over a
bailout for Cyprus, whose financial crisis threatens the euro-
area economy.  Futures swung between gains and losses as Brent, the
pricing basis for gasoline imports, narrowed its premium versus
WTI to the lowest intraday level since January. Lawmakers in
Cyprus are debating legislation to unlock bailout funds and
avert a financial collapse. Gasoline was heading toward a second
consecutive weekly loss.  “The situation in Cyprus is going to be the deciding
factor in the market,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst
at Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The deadline is Monday. The
market appears to be optimistic something will get done at the
last minute.”  Gasoline for April delivery fell 0.28 cent to $3.0678 a
gallon at 9:54 a.m. on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange. Trading
volume was 50 percent below the 100-day average for the time of
day.  Futures have retreated 3 percent this week as Brent
weakened against WTI. The European benchmark’s premium to WTI
narrowed 47 cents to $14.55 a barrel.  The  European Central Bank  has threatened to withdraw
funding from Cyprus’s banks if the government and the euro area
don’t reach agreement on a bailout plan.  The May gasoline crack spread versus WTI narrowed 57 cents
to $35.48 a barrel.  Heating oil for April delivery rose slipped 0.18 cent to
$2.8945 a gallon on volume that was 40 percent below than the
100-day average for the time of day. Futures have declined 1.5
percent this week  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to
$3.691 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. Prices have
dropped 9.5 cents since reaching a 2013 high of $3.786 on Feb.
26 and are 19.5 cents below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
