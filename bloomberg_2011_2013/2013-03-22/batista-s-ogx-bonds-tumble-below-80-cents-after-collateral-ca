The stocks and bonds of billionaire
 Eike Batista ’s oil and shipbuilding companies tumbled as concern
mounted that they’re losing access to the financing needed to
carry out investment plans.  Shares of  OSX Brasil SA (OSXB3) , Batista’s shipbuilding and oil
services unit, plunged 17 percent to a record-low 4.88 reais at
the close of trading in Sao Paulo. Oil company OGX Petroleo &
Gas Participacoes SA fell 9.2 percent, contributing most to the
Bovespa index’s 0.6 percent drop.  Disappointing production results at OGX, where output at
its first three wells fell in February, has put pressure on
Batista’s companies and will make it more difficult for them to
get financing, Oswaldo Telles, an equity analyst at  Banco
Espirito Santo SA (BES) , said by phone from  Sao Paulo . OSX’s main
business is selling production vessels to OGX.  Dollar bonds issued by OGX fell below 80 cents on the
dollar for the first time. The bonds due in 2018 declined 2.88
cents to 77.64 cents on the dollar today, pushing the yield up
94 basis points, or 0.94 percentage point, to 14.83 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Yields on OSX bonds due
in 2015 rose 82 basis points to 10.34 percent.  “This is really a bad sign,” Telles said. “They need to
keep the door open to financial markets.”  Batista, who lost $25 billion of personal wealth tied to
his companies in the past year, faces demands from creditors to
boost collateral as confidence fades in his ability to generate
cash, people familiar with the matter said earlier this week.
OSX is planning to sell $265 million in secured bonds due in
June 2014, a person familiar with the plans said March 15.  OGX  shares  have fallen 48 percent this year and OSX is down
54 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
