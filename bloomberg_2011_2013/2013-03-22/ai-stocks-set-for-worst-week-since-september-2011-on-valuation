Thai stocks fell for a fifth day,
heading for the biggest weekly slump since September 2011, on
concern valuations are expensive and as foreign investors sold
domestic equities.  Thailand’s  SET Index (SET)  slid 1.3 percent to 1,508.78 at 10:52
a.m. in Bangkok, poised for a 5.6 percent weekly loss. The gauge
rose to the highest since 1994 last week to  trade  at 14 times
estimated 12-month earnings, the most since Bloomberg began
tracking data in 2006. The measure’s 30-day volatility was 13.03
today, a seven-month high, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Bangkok Dusit Medical Services Pcl dropped 1 percent, while
 Airports of Thailand Pcl , the nation’s largest airport operator,
slumped 3.4 percent, bound for the biggest loss since Jan. 31.  “This is just a normal short-term consolidation because of
the short-term overprice,” Jessada Sookdhis, chief investment
officer at CIMB-Principal Asset Management Co., which oversees
about $1 billion of assets, said by phone from Bangkok. “The
market is still on a good long-term uptrend.”  Thai stocks have rallied 28 percent in the past year,
compared with a 1.9 percent drop in the  MSCI Emerging Markets
Index (MXEF) , as expanding infrastructure investment and consumer
spending boosted corporate profits. Overseas investors bought a
net $2.5 billion of Thai equities last year, the most since
2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Overseas investors have sold about $220 million of Thai
equities in the past four days, reducing this year’s net
purchases to $82.9 million.  Foreign Flows  Foreign inflows helped fuel a 5.4 percent appreciation in
the baht in the past 12 months, making it the second-best
performer among  emerging markets . The currency reached this week
its strongest level since the currency’s devaluation in July
1997 sparked the Asian financial crisis. The baht lost 0.1
percent to 29.23 per dollar today.  “The market has done well and some stocks are looking
speculative,” Adithep Vanabriksha, head of Thai equities at
Aberdeen Asset Management Co., which oversees about $314
billion, said by phone. “The currency is quite strong.”  Special measures to stem rapid appreciation of the baht
aren’t needed at the moment, Thai Finance Minister Kittiratt Na-
Ranong told reporters in Bangkok this week.  Fitch Ratings raised its assessment on  Thailand  this month,
citing a resilient economy and improving political stability.
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra helped defuse tension in 2011
by shelving measures that could allow the return to Thailand of
her brother, former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was
ousted in a military coup in 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
