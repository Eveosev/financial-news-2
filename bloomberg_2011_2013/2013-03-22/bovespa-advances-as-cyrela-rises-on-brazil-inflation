The  Bovespa index  rebounded from a
four-month low as homebuilders advanced after a report showed
inflation slowed more than economists forecast, damping
speculation that policy makers will raise interest rates.  Cyrela Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes  was
the best performer on the BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index after
reporting earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization that exceeded analysts’ forecasts. Steelmaker  Cia.
Siderurgica Nacional SA (CSNA3)  followed metal prices higher.  The Bovespa rose 0.2 percent to 55,672.57 at 10:29 a.m. in
Sao Paulo, paring this week’s drop to 2.1 percent. Thirty-three
 stocks  gained today while an equal number fell. The real
weakened 0.3 percent to 2.0137 per dollar.  “Inflation figures today were better than expected,”
 Alvaro Bandeira , a partner at Orama Asset Management, said by
phone from Rio de Janeiro. “Inflation will probably slow more
in the second half of the year, and stocks are pricing in this
expectation.”  Consumer prices, as measured by the government’s IPCA-15
price index, increased 0.49 percent in the month through mid-
March after rising 0.68 percent in the previous period. The
median  forecast  in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a
0.53 percent increase.  Swap rates declined after the report as traders pared bets
that policy makers will raise the benchmark rate from a record
low 7.25 percent to curb inflation. Rates on the swaps contract
due in January 2015 fell five basis points, or 0.05 percentage
point, to 8.54 percent.  Cyrela gained 4.6 percent to 16.78 reais. CSN, as Cia.
Siderurgica is known, added 1.4 percent to 9.25 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
