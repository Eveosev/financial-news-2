The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
climbed, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Series 19 Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-
grade borrowers outside  Japan  rose 2 basis points to 120 basis
points as of 8:03 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. Series 18 of the index also advanced 2
basis points to 104, RBS prices show.  The Series 19 Markit iTraxx Australia index added 2 basis
points to 120.5 as of 11:11 a.m. in Sydney, according to Westpac
Banking Corp. prices. Series 18 of the Markit iTraxx Australia
index is at 106 basis points, Westpac prices show.  The Series 19 Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 2 basis points
to 103 as of 9:02 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Citigroup Inc.
prices. The earlier Series 18 index climbed 3 to 108, Citigroup
prices show.  Fresh versions of the benchmarks are created every six
months when companies are added or dropped depending on their
ratings, cost of protection and ease of trading. The maturity
date of the new indexes is June 2018, compared with December
2017 on the Series 18 versions.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
