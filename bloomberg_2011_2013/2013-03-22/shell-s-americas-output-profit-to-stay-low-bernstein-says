Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s oil and gas
production in the Americas will remain a “low return business”
at least through 2015 because of weak prices, according to
Sanford C. Bernstein & Co.  Europe ’s largest oil company employed about $56 billion of
capital, or about 25 percent of the total, in the region last
year,  Oswald Clint , a London-based analyst at Bernstein, wrote
in a report today. The business earned only 1 percent on average
last year, less than the 24 percent from Shell’s global
production.  Shell, which last year produced more gas than oil for the
first time, in January said lower North American crude and gas
prices curbed earnings. Its Americas production business
returned on average 22 percent from 2005 to 2008, according to
Bernstein. Higher costs have also cut the company’s earnings.  “Yet even under our most optimistic scenario, Shell’s
Upstream Americas is likely to remain a low return business,”
Clint wrote. The business’s return on average capital employed
would rise to 8 percent by 2015 and “will lag” the rest of the
exploration and production operations, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
