Does anything say “patriotism” like a lovely marble bust of  Abraham Lincoln , smashed over the head of a wounded terrorist?  Certainly nothing in “ Olympus Has Fallen ,” an ugly, bloody rampage of jingoism, carnage and hand-me-down action- movie cliches.  Directed with no small skill by Antoine Fuqua, “Olympus” stars  Gerard Butler  (also a producer) as a Secret Service agent saving America from a ludicrously effective band of North Korean commandoes.  They take the White House in 13 minutes flat.  First, though, there’s a Korean warplane that strafes panicked crowds on the D.C. streets, clips the Washington Monument and generally exploits 9/11 imagery for video-game thrills.  Following an extended sequence of gunfire and blood- spattered walls, the icy Kang (Rick Yune) and his guerrilla team hunker down in an underground bunker, threatening the president ( Aaron Eckhart ) and defense secretary (Melissa Leo).  While next-in-charge politicos ( Morgan Freeman  and  Angela Bassett  in paycheck mode) negotiate from a war room, Butler’s stealth agent punches, tortures and shoots his way through White House halls and secret passages.  First-time screenwriters Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt lard the America-under-siege histrionics with loud- mouthed patriotism and a few half-hearted diatribes (“globalism and [blanking]  Wall Street ,” gripes an American traitor).  Despite some “ Zero Dark Thirty ” pseudo-documentary flourishes and heaps of portent, “Olympus” has nothing on its mind but blood sport, mayhem and graphic brutality.  “Olympus Has Fallen,” from FilmDistrict, is playing across the U.S. Rating: *1/2 (Evans)  Tina Fey  Katharine Hepburn  used to specialize in supercompetent women who get their comeuppance and learn to be “womanly.” Is this a lesson that still needs teaching?  Somebody thinks so. Portia Nathan, the alpha-dog Princeton admissions officer  Tina Fey  plays in “ Admission ,” doesn’t want kids. Her hellishly self-sufficient feminist mom (Lily Tomlin) doesn’t want men. As she angrily churns meat through a sausage grinder, you’re likely to think: Maybe it’s better that way.  Mostly I didn’t mind the movie’s formulaic predictability, since the cast -- which includes  Paul Rudd  as the head of an alternative school, Wallace Shawn as Portia’s boss and Nat Wolff as the high-school prodigy who may be the son she gave up for adoption -- nails the comic material.  I laughed a lot, until the goo started to ooze.  Brutal Process  A less shallow movie might hesitate to take on issues about which it has nothing to say: the question of opting out of parenthood, and a university admissions process so brutal that it’s hard to evaluate the ethics of violating it.  Paul Weitz, the director, and Karen Croner, the writer, stumble blithely into these minefields. As a result, “Admissions” is more disquieting than it has a right to be.  Princeton comes off looking like a snake pit with hideously inhumane values. Students who didn’t get in may find some consolation in this movie.  “Admission,” from  Focus Features , is playing across the U.S. Rating: **1/2 (Seligman)  “The Sapphires”  Not even sweet soul music can turn Vietnam circa 1968 into a feel-good trip, but “ The Sapphires ” tries its darnedest.  Inspired by a true story, polished to a jukebox-musical sheen and enlivened with a terrific (if not always period- accurate) soundtrack, “Sapphires” charts the rise of an Australian Aboriginal girl group that entertains U.S. troops at the peak of the  Vietnam war .  Cribbing a bit of “ Dreamgirls ” here and “ The Commitments ” there, director Wayne Blair turns this unlikely tale into something familiar, even cozy.  Chris O’Dowd is exceptional as the group’s good-hearted, R&B-loving Irish manager. The rest of the cast (with the iffy exception of Deborah Mailman as the cantankerous, eldest Sapphire) has more enthusiasm than chops.  “Sapphires” started life as a stage musical, and the lip- synced, overacted performances of classics like “Land of 1000 Dances” and “Soul Man” seem closer to “Glee” or “ American Idol ” than Motown and Muscle Shoals.  “The Sapphires,” from the Weinstein Company, is playing in select theaters.
