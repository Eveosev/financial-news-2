Indonesia ’s rupiah was poised for a
third weekly decline, the longest losing streak since November,
as global funds sold the nation’s assets on concern inflation
will accelerate and the fiscal deficit will widen.  The currency traded near a seven-week low as the benchmark
equity index dropped. Overseas investors have cut 2.1 trillion
rupiah ($216 million) from their sovereign debt holdings from a
record 284.9 trillion on March 14, according to finance ministry
data. The 2013 budget shortfall may exceed 2 percent of gross
domestic product due to high subsidy costs, exceeding the 1.65
percent target, Finance Minister  Agus Martowardojo  said March 19.  “The rupiah’s weakening is driven by negative sentiment on
Indonesia,” said Fahrudin Haris Prastowo, a foreign-exchange
trader at PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia in Jakarta. “Inflation will
likely accelerate and the budget deficit is still burdened by
subsidies, which is causing concern among foreign investors.”  The currency declined 0.5 percent this week to 9,757 per
dollar as of 9:08 a.m. in Jakarta, the biggest drop since the
five days ended Feb. 1, according to prices from local banks.
It fell 0.3 percent today and touched 9,770 earlier, the weakest
level since Feb. 4.  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.6 percent this
week and 0.1 percent today to 9,798, a 0.4 percent discount to
the spot rate, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Yield Curve  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,730 per dollar yesterday by the Association of Banks in
 Singapore , compared with 9,733 the previous day. The rate is
published at 11:30 a.m. in the city-state each day.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, lost 22 basis points,
or 0.22 percentage point, to 5.96 percent this week. It rose
five basis points today.  Overseas investors sold $65 million more Indonesian shares
than they bought this week, exchange data show. The Jakarta
Composite index fell 0.4 percent, adding to last week’s 1.1
percent decline.  The government’s priority is to limit subsidized-fuel usage
and increasing prices isn’t the emphasis, Finance Minister
Martowardojo said in Jakarta yesterday. Consumer prices gained
5.31 percent in February, the most in 20 months.  The difference in yield between two- and 10-year bonds
widened six basis points this week to 118 basis points, the
biggest gap since June. Longer-maturity notes are more sensitive
to inflation expectations. The yield on the 5.625 percent
securities due May 2023 was at 5.48 percent, the highest level
since Nov. 12, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
