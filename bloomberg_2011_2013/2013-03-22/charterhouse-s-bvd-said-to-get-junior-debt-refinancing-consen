Publishing BV, the information provider owned by Charterhouse
Capital Partners LLP, is said to have received permission from
its lenders to replace 140 million euros ($181 million) of
mezzanine debt with a term loan.  A majority of the Dutch company’s lenders agreed to the
request before a March 25 deadline, according to two people with
knowledge of the deal who asked not to be identified because the
matter is private.  The term loan C, which is being arranged by ING Groep NV
and Nomura Holdings Inc., is available in dollars, euros and
pounds and will total as much as 140 million euros. Portions of
the debt denominated in euros and dollars will pay an interest
margin of 475 basis points more than benchmark rates, while the
the pound debt will pay 500 basis points.  Investors who responded to the proposal by March 20 will be
awarded a consent fee of 25 basis points, while those who agreed
before the deadline will get 8 basis points. A basis point is
0.01 percentage point.  Gary Sunderland, the head of information resources at
London-based Charterhouse, did not reply to an e-mail seeking
comment.  The buyout firm acquired BvD in 2011 backed by 365 million
euros of senior loans and 140 million euros of mezzanine debt
maturing in 2019, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
