Japan   shares  fell, with the  Nikkei
225  Stock Average posting its biggest weekly decline since
November, as the yen rose after Cyprus’ bailout request was
rejected by  Russia  and new  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda failed to announce fresh stimulus.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s largest carmaker, dropped
2.2 percent. Nippon Sheet Glass Co., which counts  Europe  as its
biggest market, fell 2.7 percent. Seven & I Holdings Co. slumped
4 percent on a Nikkei newspaper report that the convenience-
store operator may miss its operating profit forecast. Broadleaf
Co., a  software developer , surged 37 percent on its market
debut.  The Nikkei 225 fell 2.4 percent to 12,338.53 at the close
in Tokyo, declining 1.8 percent on the week, its biggest weekly
drop since the period ended Nov. 9. The Topix Index slid 1.9
percent to 1,038.57, with all 33 industry groups declining.  “Investors’ sense of caution is increasing because of the
Cyprus problem, and we’re in a risk-off atmosphere,” said  Ayako Sera , a market strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank Ltd.,
which manages about $163 billion. “Kuroda didn’t announce
anything concrete and the market was a little bit ahead of
itself in terms of its expectations.”  The Topix rallied 46 percent through yesterday from Nov.
14, when elections were announced that brought Prime Minister
Shinzo Abe to power on a platform of increased stimulus and
monetary easing from the central bank. The gauge is trading at
1.2 times  book value , compared with 2.2 for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  U.S. Futures  Kuroda, speaking yesterday in his first press conference,
restated that he will do whatever it takes to achieve a 2
percent inflation target and that he may bring forward open-
ended asset purchases. He declined to comment on whether he will
call an emergency meeting before the April 3-4 policy gathering.  Futures on the  S&P 500  lost 0.1 percent today. The gauge
yesterday lost 0.8 percent as European debt concerns outweighed
better-than-estimated American economic data.  Cyprus failed to secure a bailout after Russia rebuffed the
request for funding, Cyprus’s Finance Minister Michael Sarris
said. The euro region’s third-smallest economy is trying to find
emergency financing after lawmakers rejected an unprecedented
bank deposit levy as a condition for a rescue.  The yen traded at 94.71 today, compared with as weak as
96.11 yesterday. A stronger yen cuts the overseas earnings
outlook for Japanese  exporters (TPX)  when repatriated.  Exporters were the biggest drag on the Topix today. Toyota
dropped 2.2 percent to 4,880 yen. Panasonic Co., a consumer-
electronics maker that gets nearly half its sales overseas,
slumped 2.6 percent to 676 yen.  Seven & I  Seven & I dropped 4 percent to 2,952 yen, its biggest
decline since October. The 7-Eleven operator will post operating
profit of 296 billion yen, the Nikkei reported, less than the
company’s forecast of 308 billion yen and analysts’ average
estimate of 300 billion yen.  Broadleaf surged to 1,480 yen on its trading debut, 37
percent above its 1,080 yen  initial public offering  price.  The Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index rose 14 percent
to 27.49 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 7.9
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days. Volume on
the gauge was 33 percent lower than its 30-day average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
