Pork inventories in the U.S.
increased 2.3 percent at the end of February from a year
earlier as production gained and exports fell, the government
said.  Warehouses held 636.69 million pounds of pork, up from
 622.67  million on Feb. 29, 2012, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture said today in a report. Inventories rose 5 percent
from the end of January.  U.S.  exporters  shipped 423.116 million pounds (191,922
metric tons) of pork in January, down 16 percent from 501.88
million pounds in the same period a year earlier. Wholesale
 pork  fell 4.4 percent last month, the biggest slide since
August, USDA data show. Pork  output  rose 2.2 percent to 23.25
billion pounds last year, government data show.  “You’ve got pork production up, and you’ve got lack of
exports,” Dick Quiter, an account executive at McFarland
Commodities LLC in Chicago, said in a telephone interview
before the report. “They’re not reaching into the freezer to
make up any differences anywhere.”  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.4 percent to 89.225
cents a pound at 12:11 p.m. on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
Prices were up 4.5 percent this year through yesterday.  As of Feb. 28, stockpiles of pork bellies, which are cured
and sliced to make bacon, fell 31 percent from a year earlier
to 42.7 million pounds, according to today’s report. Warehouse
supplies of ham rose 0.2 percent from a year earlier to 110.5
million pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of February were 6.1
percent larger than a year earlier at 636.2 million pounds, the
USDA said. Beef supplies rose 4.1 percent to 490.3 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
