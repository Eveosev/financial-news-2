A second trader from  Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc ’s collateralized debt obligation desk sued
the bank at a London tribunal, saying he was unfairly fired.  Wai Kin Hui was dismissed for gross misconduct in July 2012
after an internal investigation found he had been involved in
attempts by the desk to manipulate the bank’s pricing system.
Hui told the tribunal yesterday he didn’t know of any
wrongdoing.  RBS’s former head CDO trader Alex Mallinson appeared at a
London tribunal in February saying he lost about 5.6 million
pounds ($8.5 million) in deferred bonuses when the lender
dismissed him over so-called wash trades -- selling then buying
back securities with no commercial purpose. The tribunal hasn’t
issued a ruling in Mallinson’s unfair dismissal case.  Hui testified yesterday that he didn’t know how or why the
2010 trades could have been used to rig RBS’s internal valuation
system. “I still don’t know, as I sit here, how you can
manipulate” the process, he told the judge.  As the desk’s junior trader, Hui earned an annual salary of
85,000 pounds and bonuses of as much as 175,000 pounds, some of
which were withheld because of the bank’s finding of gross
misconduct, according to his written witness statement. He said
he hasn’t been able to find another job.  While damages for unfair firing are capped at about 74,000
pounds in the U.K., bank employees can seek to recover lost or
withheld bonuses if a tribunal rules they weren’t fairly
treated.  RBS spokeswoman Sarah Small and Hui’s lawyer Andrea Randall
declined to immediately comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
