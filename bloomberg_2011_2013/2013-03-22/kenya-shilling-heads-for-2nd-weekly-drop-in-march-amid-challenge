Kenya ’s shilling depreciated for a
second week this month as uncertainty about how the country’s
 Supreme Court  will rule on a challenge to Uhuru Kenyatta’s
presidential victory weighed.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy headed for a
0.2 percent drop in the first week of trading since the March 16
petition was filed. It traded 0.1 percent lower at 85.75 per
dollar by 3:39 p.m. in Nairobi, a second day of declines.  The Kenyan court has 14 days from the filing to give its
verdict on Raila Odinga’s dispute of Kenyatta’s win. It could
decide to confirm the victory or overturn the results and order
a new election, according to the country’s constitution.  “The week begun with the election petition and that is
negative news for the currency,” Duncan Kinuthia, head of
trading at Nairobi-based Commercial Bank of Africa Ltd., said by
phone. “After that, there has been very little activity in the
market.”  The  Central Bank  of Kenya offered 14 billion shillings
($140 million) in term auction deposits and received bids
totaling 7.75 billion shillings at an average yield of 9.5
percent. The bank also offered 2 billion shillings in seven-day
 repurchase agreements  and received bids amounting to 9.481
percent, an official who asked not to be identified in line with
policy said by phone today.  All the bids were accepted, the official said. The bank
uses the repos to reduce  money supply  and support the shilling.  Uganda’s currency eased 0.2 percent to 2,635 per dollar,
while the Tanzanian shilling strengthened 0.2 percent to 1,621
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
