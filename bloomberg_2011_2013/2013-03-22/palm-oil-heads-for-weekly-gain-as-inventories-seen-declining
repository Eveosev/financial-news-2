Palm oil traded near the highest
level in almost a month on speculation that stockpiles in
 Malaysia , the world’s second-biggest producer, may decline as
output drops and exports increase.  The contract for delivery in June rose as much as 1 percent
to 2,480 ringgit ($796) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange, the highest price for the most-active contract since
Feb. 25, before trading at 2,458 ringgit at 12:20 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Futures are set to gain 1.8 percent this week.  Exports from Malaysia gained 14 percent to 922,987 tons in
the first 20 days of this month from the same period in
February, Societe Generale de Surveillance said March 20.
Inventories dropped to 2.44 million tons in February from an
all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December, according to the
Malaysian Palm Oil Board. Production slumped 19 percent to 1.3
million tons last month, palm oil board data show.  “If production is lower in March, it will be the sixth
month of continuous decline,” Chandran Sinnasamy, head of
trading at LT International Futures Sdn., said by phone from
Kuala Lumpur. “This will bring down the stocks sharply in the
next one to two months.”  The gains in exports will also contribute to the decline in
inventories, Chandran said.  Soybean oil for May delivery dropped 0.3 percent to 50.26
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans for
May fell 0.6 percent to $14.41 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery was little changed
at 6,414  yuan  ($1,032) a ton on the Dalian Commodity Exchange.
Soybean oil for delivery in the same month lost 0.5 percent to
8,106 yuan a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
