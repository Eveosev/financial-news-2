Fiat SpA (F) ’s Serbian factory expects
to deliver 110,000 to 150,000 vehicles this year after six-month
orders through February exceeded the target, said Antonio Cesare
Ferrara, head of  Fiat Automobili Srbija .  Fiat took orders for more than 40,000 cars from September
to February as it continued to roll out variants of the 500L
model, including with diesel engines, right-side driving and a
U.S. version, Ferrara said. An SUV and a seven-seat option of
the 500L are planned for April and May, he said.  “We’re a little bit above the target,” Ferrara told
reporters in Belgrade today. Fiat will continue investing in its
car-making joint venture with the Serbian government and add
more than 600 jobs to the workforce of 2,500, he said.  FAS ships cars mostly to western  Europe  and may get
customs-free access to the Russian market if  Serbia  persuades
 Russia  to expand their free-trade arrangement to include
vehicles.  “Production will grow if we are able to sell this car in
Russia” without customs, Ferrara said.  To contact the reporters on this story: Gordana Filipovic in
