An original stereo pressing of the
Beatles’ debut album “Please Please Me” sold for 7,552 pounds
($11,500) at an auction today in north-west England, exactly 50
years after the band released that first vinyl LP.  Presented in a frame with a set of autographs on a magazine
page featuring the Fab Four, it was one of 280 lots of Beatles
memorabilia being offered in an anniversary sale at Omega
Auctions in Stockport, Lancashire, about 40 miles east of the
group’s home city of Liverpool.  The price, including fees, beat a minimum guide price of
7,000 pounds, based on hammer prices. It was bought by a U.K.-
based buyer, Omega Auctions said. The disc was made with both 
mono and stereo mixes.   The Beatles’ debut LP was released by Parlophone on March
22, 1963, to capitalize on the success of the group’s single,
“Please Please Me,” issued two months earlier. The George Martin-produced album, recorded in nine hours and 45 minutes,
reached number one in the charts and remained there for 30
weeks.  The most highly valued lot in the auction was a collection
of 61 vintage photographs of the Beatles’ 1965 Shea Stadium
concert in New York. The event attracted an audience of more
than 50,000 and was regarded as the highpoint of “Beatlemania.”
Estimated at 15,000 pounds to 20,000 pounds, the photos sold to
a U.K. buyer at 30,680 pounds. All auction prices include fees.  The auction’s other stand-out result was the 27,140 pounds
given for a collection of 64 color slides of the Beatles taken
in August 1964 by Robert Beck, estimated at 10,000 pounds to
15,000 pounds.  The buyer was a prominent South American collector of
Beatles memorabilia, based in Washington D.C., who also owns
John Lennon’s Oscar for “Let it Be,” Omega Auctions said.  This Beatles anniversary auction raised a total of 149,638
pounds with fees, just below the presale upper estimate of
150,000 pounds, based on hammer prices. About 80 percent of the
lots were successful, Omega said.  Muse highlights include  Warwick Thompson  on London theater,
 Jeremy Gerard  on New York theater, New York  weekend guide  and
 Lewis Lapham  on history.  To contact the writer on the story:
