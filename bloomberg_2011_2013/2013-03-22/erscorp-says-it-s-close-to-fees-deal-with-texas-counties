Merscorp Inc. and three  Texas 
counties said they are close to reaching a partial settlement of
a lawsuit accusing the mortgage registry of shortchanging local
governments on filing fees.  Merscorp said in a joint filing today with  Dallas , Harris
and Brazoria counties in federal court in Dallas that they
“have reached a tentative framework for partial settlement that
would obviate the need for trial on many of the issues currently
before the court.” They asked the court to put proceedings on
hold for 30 days so they can complete an agreement.  Dallas County filed the initial complaint in 2011, alleging
that Merscorp’s MERS registry was established by banks including
 Charlotte , North Carolina-based  Bank of America Corp.  to avoid
paying filing fees as well as to ease transfers of mortgages.
Bank of America is also a defendant in the case.  Stephen Malouf, a lawyer representing Dallas, Harris and
Brazoria counties, didn’t immediately respond after regular
business hours to a phone call seeking comment on the filing.  Thomas Hefferon, a lawyer for Bank of America, and  David
Levy , a lawyer for Merscorp, also didn’t immediately respond
after regular business hours to phone calls seeking comment.  The case is Dallas County v. Merscorp Inc., 11-cv-02733,
U.S. District Court, Northern District of Texas (Dallas).  To contact the reporter on this story:
