China ’s commercial crude
inventories dropped to the lowest level in a year in February,
while diesel stockpiles climbed to the highest in 10 months.  Crude supplies, excluding emergency reserves, fell 2.9
percent from a month earlier, according to the official Xinhua
News Agency’s China Oil, Gas & Petrochemicals newsletter today.
Inventories declined to 28.02 million metric tons, or 205
million barrels, the lowest since February 2012, according to
calculations by Bloomberg based on the data. Diesel inventories
rose 18 percent to 11.19 million tons, the highest since April.  China ran down its crude stockpiles in February as  imports 
and production dropped. Net purchases from overseas slid to 20.7
million tons, the lowest level in five months, customs data
showed March 8. Domestic  crude output  was 16 million tons, the
least in two years, figures from the Beijing-based China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing showed March 12. Oil
demand typically falls over the Lunar New Year holiday, which
ran from Feb. 9 to Feb. 15 this year.  “The crude stock drawdown is mainly because both output
and imports are down,” Jean Zou, an oil analyst at ICIS C1
Energy, a Shanghai-based commodities researcher, said in an e-
mail today. “The increase in diesel stocks is mainly due to the
holiday break when refiners don’t have many diesel orders.”  China’s gasoline stockpiles slid 7.8 percent to 6.82
million tons, while kerosene inventories climbed 2 percent to
1.48 million tons, today’s data showed.  The nation’s  diesel exports  more than tripled in February
from a year earlier to 254,871 tons and imports fell 74 percent
to 45,736 metric tons, according to customs figures yesterday.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
