Jet fuel in  New York  Harbor
weakened versus futures to the  lowest level  in more than four
months after area inventories rose to a two-year  seasonal high .  Supplies of the fuel on the East Coast, the PADD 1 region,
grew by  640,000 barrels  to 9.71 million in the week ended March
15, the most for this time of year since 2010, according to
Energy Information Administration data compiled by Bloomberg.  New York Harbor  No. 54 jet fuel  fell 0.87 cent to a 5.13-
cent premium against  futures  traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  at 2:07 p.m., the narrowest differential since Dec. 18,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The spread has narrowed 14.37 cents since its year-high of
19.5 cents on Jan. 22.  East Coast stockpiles  have grown by more
than 1 million barrels, or 12 percent, in the past eight weeks,
according to the EIA.  Some of the increase follows the startup of a fluid
catalytic cracker at  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL) â€™s 185,000-barrel-a-day
Trainer,  Pennsylvania , refinery. Work on the unit began at the
end of December and finished in early February, said Trebor Banstetter, a Delta spokesman in Atlanta.  Trainer accounts for nearly 14 percent of  East Coast
refining capacity , which is about 1.29 million barrels,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Reformulated gasoline  in New York Harbor weakened 0.75 cent
to a discount of 19.13 cents against futures, while ultra-low-
sulfur diesel fuel was unchanged at a premium of  10 cents  versus
heating oil futures.  The 3-2-1 crack spread in New York, a measure of refining
profitability for gasoline and diesel fuel based on Brent oil in
 Europe , dropped $1.31 to $14.37 a barrel, a second consecutive
daily decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
