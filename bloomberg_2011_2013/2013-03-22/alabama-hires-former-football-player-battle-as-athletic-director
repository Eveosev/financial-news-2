The  University of Alabama  hired
former Crimson Tide football player Bill Battle as the school’s
athletic director, succeeding Mal Moore.  University trustees unanimously approved the hiring of
Battle, 71, a day after he received endorsements from university
President Judy Bonner and Moore, a former teammate who stepped
down two days ago, citing unspecified health problems.  Battle was a starter for the Crimson Tide under Coach Paul “Bear” Bryant from 1960 to 1962, including the school’s
national championship in 1961. He was coach of the  University of
Tennessee  for seven years in the 1970s, and later founded the
Collegiate Licensing Company, serving as president and chief
executive until 2002. The company was acquired by  IMG  in 2007.  Alabama ’s football team won the Bowl Championship Series
national title this year, its third in four years. The men’s
basketball team plays tomorrow in the second round of the
National Invitation Tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
