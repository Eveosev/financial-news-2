Gold futures fell as lawmakers in
Cyprus debated measures needed for a bailout, crimping demand
for the precious metal as a store of value. Silver dropped the
most in three weeks.  Averof Neofytou, the deputy president of Cyprus’s ruling
Disy party, said that a “framework” on a bailout package may
be set “in the next few hours.” Gold rose for the third
straight week, partly because of concerns that Europe’s debt
crisis will escalate.  “The markets are sensing that there may be some kind of
resolution,” James Cordier, the founder of Optionsellers.com in
Tampa, Florida, said in a telephone interview.  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for April delivery
dropped 0.5 percent to settle at $1,606.10 an ounce at 1:39 p.m.
This week, the price rose 0.8 percent, and the third gain marked
the longest rally in six months.  Gold has dropped 4.2 percent this year. Holdings in
exchange-traded products backed by the metal have slumped 6.8
percent in 2013, heading for the first quarterly decline in two
years, data tracked by Bloomberg showed.  Silver futures for May delivery fell 1.8 percent to $28.698
an ounce on the Comex, the biggest drop since Feb. 28.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
April delivery gained 0.1 percent to $1,581.70 an ounce. The
metal declined 0.7 percent this week.  Palladium futures for June delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$761.55 an ounce. The price dropped 1.8 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
