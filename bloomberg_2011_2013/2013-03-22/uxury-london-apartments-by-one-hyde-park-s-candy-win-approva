CPC Group, the developer owned by
 Christian Candy , won approval from the  City of London  borough’s
members to build 165 apartments near the Tower of London.  CPC bought the Sugar Quay site in the City of London
financial district in February 2011 and sought to develop an 11-
story building with apartments and a shop on the bank of the
 River Thames  near Tower Bridge. The development can go ahead
after today’s vote.  Developers are turning obsolete commercial buildings into
apartments in the City of London as non-prime offices on the
fringes of the financial district become difficult to lease.
Architects Foster + Partners have been working with CPC on the
development proposal, according to a statement in November when
planning permission was sought. The site already had approval
for an office building when it was bought by Guernsey, Channel
Islands-based CPC, according to the company’s website.  CPC developed the luxury One Hyde Park apartment project in
Knightsbridge as part of a joint venture with closely held
Waterknights.  To contact the reporters on this story:
