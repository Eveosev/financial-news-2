EU carbon prices dropped as demand
fell in an auction of new allowances, paring a weekly gain
spurred by speculation that European Union governments are
nearing agreement on a proposal to boost prices.  December futures advanced 9.8 percent this week to close at
4.15 euros a ton on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange. The
gained as much as 15 percent yesterday after an EU presidency
official said there’s growing support among member states for a
plan that would enable delaying auctions of some carbon permits.  The benchmark contract fell 6.1 percent today after a
German auction of spot permits got the lowest-ever volume of
bids. Germany offered 5 million allowances and received bids for
a little more than 6 million, giving a so-called cover ratio of
1.2, the lowest for any sale of Phase 3 permits.  “The German auction showed that genuine buyers are not in
the market at the moment, and at these prices people are
unwilling to enter long positions,” Milan Hudak, an analyst at
Virtuse Energy sro in Prague, said today by e-mail. “The
optimism of earlier in the week hit the wall of fundamentals and
ongoing oversupply.”  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
dropped 3.1 percent this week to close at 31 euro cents a ton in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
