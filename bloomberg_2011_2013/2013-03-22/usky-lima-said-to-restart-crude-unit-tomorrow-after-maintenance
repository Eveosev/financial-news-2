Husky Energy Inc. (HSE)  expects to
restart a crude unit and several related units tomorrow at its
refinery in  Lima ,  Ohio , and have them running normally as soon
as Monday, according to a person familiar with operations at the
plant.  The company is also loading catalyst into a new kerosene
hydrotreater today and expects to have the unit up and running
within the next 30 days, said the person, who asked not to be
identified because he is not authorized to speak for the plant.  The Lima refinery can process as much as 160,000 barrels of
crude a day. It processes primarily light, sweet crude, Husky
said on its website.  The refinery has been running a crude unit, a vacuum unit,
an ultraformer, a hydrocracker and a gas plant at reduced rates
for the past two weeks while planned maintenance was under way,
the person said.  A “minor turnaround” began March 10 and was expected to
last two weeks, Kim Guttormson, a spokeswoman for Calgary-based
Husky, said in an e-mail. The work is on schedule, she said.  The kerosene hydrotreater will be able to process 20,000
barrels a day of feedstock. The unit will increase diesel and
jet fuel production. Husky said in its fourth-quarter earnings
statement on Feb. 6 that it was nearing completion of
construction of the unit and expected to start production later
this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
