Lenzing AG (LNZ) , an Austrian maker of
cellulose fibers, fell the most in 10 months after the company
said growth will slow and its outlook was less than estimated.  Earnings before interest and tax this year will range
between 140 million euros ($181 million) and 170 million euros,
the Lenzing, Austria-based company said today. Analysts had
expected Ebit of 205 million euros, according to  data  compiled
by Bloomberg. Lenzing shares fell as much as 6 percent, the
biggest intraday drop since May 14.  “It’s time to adjust our growth rate to the environment,”
said Thomas Winkler, Lenzing’s chief financial officer, at a
press conference in Vienna. Visibility into the fiber market
remains low, he said.  Profit margins of Lenzing’s wood fibers, which are linked
to the price of cotton, contracted in 2012. Cotton spot prices
ended last year 12 percent below their peak price, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The cotton price is very volatile,” Chief Executive
Officer Peter Untersperger said, adding that  China  has collected
a large stockpile of the material. “That confuses the market.”  Lenzing shares were down 4.9 percent at 68.01 euros as of
2:27 p.m. in Vienna. It was today’s worst performance on the 39-
member  Bloomberg EMEA Chemicals Index. (BEUCHEM)   Full-year net income attributable to shareholders fell 32
percent to 175.6 million euros. Revenue dipped to 2.09 billion
euros from 2.14 billion euros.  The drop in margins forecast by Lenzing is considerable,
said Bernhard Selinger, a Vienna-based analyst at Raiffeisen
Centrobank, via telephone. The company may be exercising caution
with its forecasts to avoid revisions later in the year, he
said.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will be as much as 290 million euros while sales
may reach 2.25 billion euros, the company said. Analysts
expected 337.8 million euros Ebitda on 2.16 billion euros sales,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Lenzing also announced that it is evaluating offers to buy
its plastics unit, which last year generated 109.4 million euros
of sales, in order focus on its core fiber business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
