OTP Bank Nyrt. (OTP) ,  Hungary ’s largest
lender, headed for its biggest weekly slump in five months after
 Standard & Poor’s  revised the outlook on the country’s credit
rating to negative from stable.  The shares fell 2.9 percent to 4,400 forint by 11:39 a.m.
in Budapest, extending the decline in the past five days to 5.4
percent, the biggest such drop since Oct. 19. The benchmark BUX
stock index, in which OTP has the biggest  weighting  at 33
percent, slid 1.7 percent, down 2.2 percent in the week.  S&P kept Hungary’s rating at BB, two levels below
investment grade, according to a statement published after the
end of trading yesterday. Banks were among the biggest losers
among European stocks today as Cypriot lawmakers begin a debate
to unlock bailout funds and prevent a financial collapse.  “The stock market is reacting to the S&P move in an
already negative international environment,” Budapest-based
analysts at Erste Group Bank AG including Jozsef Miro wrote in a
research report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
