The number of energy rigs in the
U.S. declined this week to the lowest level in almost two years,
according to  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   The total rig count fell by 30 to 1,746, the Houston-based
field-services company said on its website. The count was the
lowest since March 25, 2011. Oil rigs dropped by 17 to 1,324.
Natural gas rigs declined by 13 to 418.  U.S. gas rigs have dropped five straight quarters as
declining demand for the heating fuel and a glut of domestic
supplies drove down prices, prompting energy producers to focus
on more lucrative oil and liquids-rich plays.  The gas rig count has ranged from 407 to 439 this quarter
as natural  gas prices  have surged 18 percent, reaching $3.96 per
million British thermal units at 12:27 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Last year, natural gas prices averaged
$2.827. The average for the five years ended 2012 was $4.862.  Power producers have reacted to the low price of natural
gas by switching their fuel use to gas from coal. Utilities
increased power generation from natural gas by 21 percent to 1.2
billion megawatts last year and decreased coal-fired generation
by 12 percent to 1.5 billion, the U.S. Energy Information Agency
said in a  report  released yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
