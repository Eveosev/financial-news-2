Cia. Cervecerias Unidas SA (CCU) ,  Chile ’s
largest brewer, rose to a record on speculation that the shares
are undervalued relative to peers.  CCU, as the company is also known, advanced 2.9 percent to
a record 7,972 pesos at the close in Santiago, its biggest
increase in six months and its fourth day of gains.  CCU’s shares trade at 22 times its trailing earnings, which
 compares  with 23 times for Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB, 32
times for Grupo Modelo SA de CV, 25 times for Cia. de Bebidas
das Americas (AmBev) and 30 times for Coca-Cola Femsa SAB,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The whole beverages industry has seen a rise in their
multiples versus their historic averages,” Isabel Darrigrandi,
an analyst at BTG Pactual, said in a telephone interview from
Santiago. “CCU was lagging in that area.”  CCU is the dominant brewer in Chile with 80.2 percent
market share as of the end of 2011, according to reports on its
website. It also controlled 23 percent of the Argentine beer
market, according to the same report.  “When you look at its multiples, it’s evidently behind,”
Osvaldo Pacheco, an analyst at Banco de Credito & Inversiones,
said by phone. “The shares had also been overlooked because of
CCU’s exposure to  Argentina  and the  capital controls  there.”  The company’s stock rose 11 percent in 2012,
underperforming other Chilean bottlers such as Embotelladora
Andina SA, which gained 33 percent and Coca-Cola Embonor SA,
which jumped 61 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
