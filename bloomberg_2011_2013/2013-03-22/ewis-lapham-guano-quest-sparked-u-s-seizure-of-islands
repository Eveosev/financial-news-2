The blue-footed booby, red-legged
cormorant and the Humboldt penguin are among the 150 species of
birds that live on the Peruvian islands of the Ballestas.  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Owing to a strong offshore current, there is scant rainfall
and sparse vegetation, so the bird droppings are baked dry,
making the guano into excellent fertilizer. In fact, during the
1800s the sale of guano to  Europe  gave Peru its most valuable
source of revenue.  To get in on the action, in 1856 the U.S. passed the Guano
Act, which authorized Americans to seize unoccupied islands not
already claimed by other countries that contained bird
droppings. The U.S. was prepared to defend its guano interests
with military action.  The last big island to be annexed by the U.S. under the
Guano Act was Midway.  I spoke with J. Edward Chamberlin, author of “Island: How
Islands Transform the World,” on the following topics:  1. Creation Myths  2. Crossing the Water  3. Garden of Eden  4. Island Cities  5. Polynesian Navigation  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
