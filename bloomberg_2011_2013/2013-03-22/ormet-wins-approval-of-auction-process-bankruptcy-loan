Ormet Corp., the operator of an
 Ohio  aluminum smelter, won court approval to hold an auction to
sell virtually all its assets, with an affiliate of lender
Wayzata Investment Partners LLC making the lead bid.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath approved the procedures
that will govern the auction process and also granted the
company final approval of a $90 million loan from Wayzata and
Wells Fargo Capital Finance LLC, according to court documents
filed today and yesterday. Wayzata is providing $30 million and
Wells Fargo the remaining $60 million.  Ormet will hold an auction on May 13 to see if there are
any potential buyers willing to top Wayzataâ€™s so-called
stalking-horse offer of about $221 million in debt forgiveness,
court filings show. If no competing offers surface, the company
will cancel the auction and seek court approval to sell its
assets to Wayzata at a May 15 hearing. Competing bids must be
submitted by May 8.  The aluminum producer, based in Hannibal, Ohio, listed
assets of $407 million and debt of $416 million, according to
court documents.  Ormet has the ability to produce 270,000 tons of aluminum a
year when operating at full capacity, court papers show. Its
alumina refinery in Burnside,  Louisiana , one of only four in the
U.S., is capable of producing 540,000 tons of smelter-grade
alumina a year at full capacity.  The case is In re Ormet Corp., 13-bk-10334,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
