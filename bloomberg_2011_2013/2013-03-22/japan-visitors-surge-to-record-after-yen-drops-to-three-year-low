Foreign visitors to  Japan  rose 33
percent last month to their highest on record for a February as
a weakening yen boosted travelers’ buying power.  Arrivals increased to 729,500 in February, from 547,948 a
year earlier, the Japan National Tourism Organization said in a
 report  today. That’s the highest for a February, according to
tourism agency statistics going back to 1964.  Tourists are taking advantage of the Japanese government’s
efforts to curb the yen as a way to boost the economy by helping
exporters, Masahiro Yabuta, an economics professor at Tokyo’s
 Chuo University , said in a phone interview. The government has
pledged stimulus measures, dubbed “Abenomics” after Japanese
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, causing the yen to depreciate about
20 percent since mid-November following a postwar high of 75.35
reached in October 2011.  “After Abenomics, thanks to the depreciating yen, many
inbound tourists gain a benefit,” Yabuta said. “Prices
actually decrease if I spend a dollar in Japan instead of
America.”  The Japanese currency weakened to 96.71 yen against the
dollar on March 12, the lowest since August 2009. The yen
averaged averaged 93.13 versus the dollar in February, 19
percent weaker than 78.48 in the month a year ago.  Visitors from Hong Kong posted the biggest increase, rising
97 percent to 56,500, while the number of travelers from  Taiwan 
climbed 74 percent to 150,300, according to the tourism agency.  Fukushima Effect  Travelers from  China , with which Japan has a territorial
dispute over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea, recorded
the only decrease in February, falling 2 percent to 80,900.  The total increase is also being fueled by the dissipating
effect on tourism of the March 2011 nuclear disaster at the
Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant, Yabuta said.  Travelers have grown to trust government assurances
regarding the containment of the accident, in which three
reactors melted down after a tsunami caused by the country’s
biggest earthquake on record, he said.  “Prices for tourists have been low for years, ever since
the earthquake,” said Aya Kashigawa, who directs the tourism
agency’s office in South Korea, from which visitors increased 39
percent last month. “Now, with the yen so weak, it really works
out to Korean travelers’ benefit when they spend money in
Japan.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
