Ethanol slumped against gasoline on
speculation that this month’s price increase will boost the
appeal of Brazilian imports.  The price difference, or spread, expanded 1.69 cents to
51.85 cents a gallon. U.S. refiners  imported  the biofuel in the
week ended March 15 for the first time since Feb. 22, a report
from the Energy Information Administration showed.  “We’ve got some numbers now that make  Brazil  attractive,”
said Mike Blackford, a consultant at INTL FCStone in  Des Moines ,
 Iowa . “That puts a lid on it.”  Denatured ethanol for April delivery dropped 2.5 cents, or
1 percent, to $2.544 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 16 percent this year.  Gasoline futures for April delivery slipped 0.81 cent, or
0.3 percent, to $3.0625 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, which is
made to be blended with ethanol before delivery to filling
stations.  Brazil, the largest supplier of ethanol to the U.S., uses
sugarcane to make the fuel, while U.S. distillers mostly
manufacture the biofuel from corn.  The U.S. imported an average of 22,000 barrels a day in the
first 11 weeks of 2013, according to the EIA, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm. The average was less than 2,000 for
the first 11 weeks of 2012.  Spot ethanol in Sao Paulo  fetched $2.37 a gallon last week,
6.8 percent below today’s futures price.  Corn Slips  Corn for May delivery sank 6.75 cents, or 0.9 percent, to
$7.2625 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The corn crush spread, representing gains or losses from
turning corn into ethanol and based on May contracts, was minus
13 cents a gallon, down from minus 12 cents yesterday. The
amount doesn’t include revenue from the sale of dried
distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol production, which can
be fed to livestock.  Poor returns for the fuel, due to the higher corn prices,
have led to the lowest season production levels in records going
back to June 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Ethanol  output  last week averaged 809,000 barrels a day,
down 9.4 percent from a year earlier and down 16 percent from
the record 963,000 in December 2011, according to the EIA.
Stockpiles of the biofuel have fallen a record seven consecutive
weeks to 18.5 million barrels, the lowest level in more than
four months, the EIA’s March 20 report showed.  Less Consumption  Ethanol prices have suffered as a result of lower gasoline
consumption, shrinking the motor fuel pool in which it could be
blended, Blackford said.  Gasoline  demand , measured by deliveries to wholesalers,
fell to 8.32 million barrels a day, the lowest level since Jan.
11, according to EIA data. Ethanol-blended gasoline last week
accounted for a record 95 percent of total motor fuel
consumption.  “These guys are blending and blending hard, which tells me
they’ve had their fill,” Blackford said.  In cash market trading, ethanol on the West Coast, the most
expensive hub in the U.S., tumbled 4.5 cents to $2.825 a gallon.
In  New York , the additive lost 4 cents to $2.66; in Chicago the
biofuel slumped 3 cents to $2.54; and in the U.S. Gulf the
renewable fuel decreased 3 cents to $2.60, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the Gulf narrowed to 22.5
cents, while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor shrank to 12
cents.  RINs Decline  Ethanol Renewable Identification Numbers for the  corn-based 
variety sank 3 cents, or 4.3 percent, to 67.5 cents, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. RINs are assigned to each gallon
of fuel introduced the market, then submitted by refiners to the
Environmental Protection Agency to show compliance with the law
or traded.  Advanced RINs, which include biodiesel and Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol, were unchanged at 75.5 cents.  The certificates for each RIN peaked at a record on March 8
at $1.06 for the conventional grain-based variety and $1.08 for
the advanced.  The price surge for RINs has been a source of contention
between ethanol proponents and petroleum advocates, with U.S.
Senator  Ron Wyden , an Oregon Democrat, and chairman of the
Senate’s Energy and Natural Resources Committee, asking the EPA
today for data that would explain the recent volatility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
