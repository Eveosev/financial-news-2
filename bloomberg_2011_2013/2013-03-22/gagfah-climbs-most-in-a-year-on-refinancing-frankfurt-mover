Gagfah SA (GFJ)  rose the most in a year
after the second-largest owner of German homes said it had
completed most of the refinancing on a 2.1 billion euro ($2.7
billion) loan due in August.  Gagfah climbed as much as 6.5 percent in Frankfurt trading,
the most since March 28, 2012. The  shares  were up about 4.9
percent at 9.46 euros at 1:22 p.m. in Frankfurt trading, lifting
its market value to 1.95 billion euros.  The company has signed term sheets for five of six portions
of its German residential funding loan, according to an  analyst
presentation  posted today on its website. The final part will
probably be a 700-million euro commercial mortgage-backed
security with a weighted average maturity of seven years, Gagfah
Chief Financial Officer Gerald Klinck said on a conference call
today.  “A successful refinancing will drive the share price in
the short term,” Kai Klose, an analyst at Berenberg Bank, said
in a note today. “Gagfah is making good progress in its efforts
to reposition the company.”  Gagfah in the past year has focused on reducing its debt,
with 3.4 billion euros of debt maturing in 2013. In February,
Gagfah got a five-year, 1 billion-euro loan from Bank of America
Corp. to refinance debt that would have matured in May.  Gagfah has gained about 60 percent in the past 12 months,
making it the second-best performer on the FTSE EPRA NAREIT
Index of German property stocks, which has gained 21 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
