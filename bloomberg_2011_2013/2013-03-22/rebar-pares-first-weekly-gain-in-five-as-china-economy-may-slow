Steel reinforcement-bar futures
pared the first weekly gain in five on concern that growth in
 China  will falter and Europe’s debt crisis may worsen.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell 0.2 percent to 3,895  yuan  ($627) a metric ton at
9:57 a.m. local time, trimming this week’s gain to 0.9 percent.  The Shanghai Composite Index has dropped 4.4 percent from
its Feb. 6 peak on concern that an economic recovery will weaken
as officials take steps to cool the  property market  and counter
risks for banks from an expansion in credit.  “Lower raw-material costs, a weak PMI in the euro region
and a  crisis in Cyprus  all kept sentiment in check,” China
CIFCO Futures Co. said in a report today.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port was little
changed at $134.20 a ton yesterday, according to data compiled
by The Steel Index Ltd. The  average spot price  of rebar was
little changed yesterday at 3,683 yuan, according to data from
Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
