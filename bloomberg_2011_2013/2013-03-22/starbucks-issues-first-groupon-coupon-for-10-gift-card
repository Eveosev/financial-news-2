Starbucks Corp. (SBUX) , the world’s
largest coffee-shop operator, today issued an online coupon
though deal website  Groupon Inc. (GRPN)  in a bid to bring new customers
into its U.S. and Canadian stores.  “It was just a really great offer for us to be able to
give to our customers,”  Linda Mills , a spokeswoman for the
Seattle-based brewer, said in a telephone interview. This is the
first time that Starbucks has used Groupon, she said.  Customers who spend $5 on the coupon get a printable gift
card to use in stores for $10. More than 100,000 of the Groupon
deals have been sold so far, Mills said. She declined to say how
many of the coupons were available for purchase.  After the Starbucks deal was introduced, the site to buy it
stopped working.  “We’re experiencing a huge reaction to the offer, so it’s
temporarily down,” Mills said. “It should be up and running
very soon.”  Starbucks  rose  0.6 percent to $57.38 at the close in  New
York . Groupon jumped 5.9 percent to $5.74.  Last year Starbucks did similar deals through Google Inc.
and LivingSocial. The coffee seller has more than 11,100 shops
in the U.S. and about 1,190 in Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
