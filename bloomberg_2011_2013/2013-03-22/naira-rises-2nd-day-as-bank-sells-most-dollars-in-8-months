Nigeria ’s naira climbed for a
second day after the central bank sold the most dollars at its
twice-weekly sales in eight months.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest economy gained 0.2
percent to 158.25 per dollar by 3:08 p.m. in Lagos, the
commercial capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg,
bringing the weekly rise to the same level.  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  sold  $580 million  to lenders
this week at two regular foreign-currency auctions, the most
since the week through July 4, 2012. The Abuja-based regulator
uses the sales to stabilize the naira as the cost of importing
refined fuel, which accounts for 70 percent of the local
gasoline market, boosts dollar demand and puts pressure on the
currency. The bank cut total sales by 6 percent last week to
$360 million.  “On the back of the increased foreign-exchange sales from
the bank, the naira stabilized this week,” Ridle Markus and
 Dumisani Ngwenya , Africa strategists at  Absa Capital  in
Johannesburg, wrote in a note to clients today. “The increased
supply was amid visible pressures on the naira.”  The central bank can sell more dollars to ensure the
stability of the naira, Governor Lamido Sanusi said after the
bank’s Monetary Policy Committee meeting on March 19, where it
kept its benchmark  interest rate  at a record high of 12 percent
for a ninth consecutive meeting.  The yield on the country’s 16.39 percent domestic bonds due
January 2022 were unchanged at 11.24 percent in the secondary
market, according to yesterday’s data compiled on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website. Yields on the $500 million
of Eurobonds due January 2021 declined 6.5 basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 4.239 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi was little changed at 1.94 per dollar in
Accra, the capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
