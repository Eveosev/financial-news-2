Taiwan ’s dollar completed its
fourth weekly decline as overseas investors pulled the most
money from stocks in 10 months on concern the island’s economic
recovery is slowing. Government bonds advanced.  Global funds sold $1.2 billion more shares than they bought
this week, the most since the period ending May 12, according to
exchange data. Export orders slumped 14.5 percent last month
from a year earlier, more than the 3 percent drop economists
surveyed by Bloomberg estimated, official data showed March 20.
Industrial production slowed for the first time since June,
another Bloomberg survey showed before a report due March 25.  “Sentiment has been pretty bad this week,” said Eric Hsing, a fixed-income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.
“Concern about Taiwan’s economic recovery has been reignited.”  The local dollar fell 0.5 percent this week to NT$29.909
against its U.S. counterpart, the weakest level since Sept. 7,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It slipped 0.2 percent today and
was little changed one minute before the market close.  The central bank has sold the local currency in the run-up
to the close on most days in the past year, according to traders
who asked not to be identified.  One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.6 percent this
week and 0.3 percent today to NT$29.885, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the exchange rate used to price options, gained 38 basis points
to 3.71 percent from the end of last week, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. It rose 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage
point, today.  The yield on the 1.125 percent government bonds due March
2023 fell two basis points today and this week to 1.30 percent,
according to Gretai Securities Market. The  overnight interbank
lending  rate was little changed at 0.387 percent, a weighted
average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank Money Center shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
