Harvard University pulled off a
historic upset at the men’s college basketball national
tournament on the same day Gonzaga University avoided one in its
first appearance as a No. 1 seed.  Harvard, champion of the Ivy League, won a National
Collegiate Athletic Association tournament game for the first
time, beating the  University of New Mexico  68-62 last night in
Salt Lake City. Harvard provided the biggest upset on the
tournament’s first full day of play, as the Crimson were seeded
14th in the 16-team West region and New Mexico was a third seed.  “I’m exceptionally proud of our guys,” Harvard coach
Tommy Amaker said in a televised interview. “We talked about
preparation, we talked about passion and we talked about
belief.”  Gonzaga got a scare from Southern University in the West
region, needing an 8-2 scoring run in the final 3 1/2 minutes to
pull out a 64-58 win and avoid becoming the first No. 1 seed to
ever lose to a 16th seeded team. It was the closest such game at
the tournament since 1996, when Western Carolina lost by two
points against Purdue.  “That was a tough, hard-fought battle right down to the
very end,” Gonzaga coach Mark Few said at a news conference.
“The more I watched film on them the more I thought, ‘Hey, this
could be a real grinder.’ Then the crowd gets going and
everybody wants to see that first 1-16 loss.”  Louisville Win  Louisville, the top seed in the Midwest region, followed
with a 79-48 rout of North Carolina A&T in Lexington,  Kentucky ,
giving No. 1 regional seeds a 114-0 record against 16th seeds
since the NCAA tournament field expanded in 1985.  Twelve of yesterday’s 16 games were won by the higher-
ranked team, with Syracuse, Virginia Commonwealth, Butler,
Marquette, Michigan State,  Memphis , Saint Louis, Colorado State,
Michigan and Arizona also advancing. A pair of 12th seeds from
the Pacific-12 conference had upsets, as  Oregon  beat Oklahoma
State 68-55 and  California  ousted Nevada Las Vegas 64-61,
marking the 12th time in 13 years at least one No. 12 seed has
ousted a fifth seed. Wichita State, a ninth seed in the Midwest,
beat No. 8 Pittsburgh 73-55.  Today’s Games  Kansas , the No. 1 seed in the South region, and  Indiana ,
the top team in the East, are both in action today as 16 more
games are scheduled in Philadelphia; Kansas City; Dayton,  Ohio ;
and Austin,  Texas .  The No. 2 seeds in all four regions also play their opening
games today, with Duke facing  Albany  in the Midwest, Georgetown
meeting Florida Gulf Coast in the South, Miami playing Pacific
in the East and Ohio State taking on Iona College in the West.  Harvard became the second Ivy League school since 2000 to
win a game at the NCAA tournament as Wesley Saunders scored 18
points and Laurent Rivard added 17 while going 5-of-9 on 3-point
attempts. The Crimson shot 52 percent and held New Mexico to 38
percent shooting. It was the second time in seven years that a
14th seed has knocked out a No. 3 tournament seed.  With the win by the Crimson, Ivy League schools improved to
41-76 in NCAA tournament history. The Ivy League is now 3-13
since 2000, with the two previous wins coming when Cornell
University upset Temple and  Wisconsin  to reach the final 16 in
2010.  Harvard (20-9) advanced to face sixth-seeded  Arizona  (26-7),
an 81-64 winner against No. 11 Belmont, tomorrow in Salt Lake
City.  Gonzaga (32-2) next faces Wichita State after Kelly Olynyk
scored 17 of his 21 points in the second half to help the
Bulldogs pull away from Southern.  Steal Record  Louisville never trailed in its rout of 16th-seeded North
Carolina A&T, forcing 25 turnovers -- including a tournament-
record 20 steals -- and shooting 56 percent in Lexington,
Kentucky. Russ Smith had 23 points and seven steals for the
Cardinals (30-5), who next play No. 8 Colorado State, which
defeated ninth-seeded Missouri 84-72.  Marquette, the No. 3 seed in the East region, erased a
seven-point deficit in the final two minutes to pull out a 59-58
win against Davidson College. The Golden Eagles hit three
straight 3-pointers after missing 11 of their first 12 attempts
and got a driving layup from junior guard Vander Blue with one
second left to pull out the victory.  “That’s March Madness,” Marquette coach Buzz Williams
said. “We’re thankful to still be standing.”  Marquette moves on to face No. 6 seed Butler, which beat No.
11 Bucknell 68-56 by outscoring the Bison 37-19 over the final
10 minutes in Lexington.  Michigan State  Michigan  State, the third seed in the Midwest, defeated
Valparaiso 65-54 to earn a matchup with No. 6 Memphis, which
survived a last-second 3-point attempt by 11th-seeded Saint
Mary’s to win 54-52.  Saint Louis, the No. 4 seed in the Midwest, topped 13th-
seeded New Mexico State 64-44. The Billikens next face 12th-
seeded Oregon, which beat No. 5 Oklahoma State 68-55.  California, the 12th seed in the East, followed with its
three-point win against UNLV. The Bears’ next opponent is No. 4
Syracuse, which recorded yesterday’s biggest win with an 81-34
demolition of 13th-seeded  Montana .  Michigan, which is seeded fourth in the South region,
cruised past No. 13 South Dakota State 71-56 as Tim Hardaway Jr.
and Glenn Robinson III each scored 21 points. Next up for the
Wolverines is No. 5 Virginia Commonwealth, which rolled past
12th-seeded Akron 88-42.  The NCAA championship game is April 8 in Atlanta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
