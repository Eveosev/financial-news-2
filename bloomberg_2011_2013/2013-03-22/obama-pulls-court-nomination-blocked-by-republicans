President  Barack Obama  withdrew his
nomination of New York lawyer Caitlin Halligan to the nation’s
second most influential appeals court after Republicans twice
blocked a vote on her confirmation.  The nomination of Halligan, a former New York state
solicitor general, has languished in the Senate since Obama
chose her in September 2010 for the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, considered second only to the
U.S.  Supreme Court  in its legal influence.  Halligan would have filled the spot that Chief Justice  John Roberts  vacated after being nominated to the Supreme Court.  Republicans used a procedural maneuver known as a
filibuster to block Halligan’s nomination. A Senate vote on
March 6 to cut off the debate failed, with 51 votes in favor,
short of the 60-vote threshold needed to end the filibuster.  Obama said in a statement e-mailed this afternoon that he
is “deeply disappointed” by the “unjustified filibuster.”  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman  Patrick Leahy , a
Vermont Democrat, said in a statement that “had she received an
up-or-down vote, I am certain she would have been confirmed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
