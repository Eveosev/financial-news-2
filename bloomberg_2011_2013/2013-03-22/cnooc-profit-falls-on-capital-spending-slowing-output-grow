Cnooc Ltd. (883)  reported lower 2012
profits that missed analyst estimates, as China’s biggest
offshore oil producer spent more to revive output growth, an
effort underscored by its $15.1 billion takeover of Canadian oil
producer  Nexen Inc. (NXY)   Net income fell to 63.7 billion  yuan  ($10.3 billion) from
70.3 billion yuan in 2011, the company said in Hong Kong stock
exchange filing yesterday. That compared with the 65.3 billion
yuan mean of 29 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
climbed 2.8 percent to 247.6 billion yuan.  Cnooc’s purchase of Nexen, China’s largest foreign
acquisition, will be a platform for future growth, Chief
Executive Officer Li Fanrong said at a press conference in Hong
Kong. The company, which operates in  Canada ’s oil sands, the
North Sea and offshore West Africa, will add 20 percent to
Cnooc’s  production  and 30 percent to reserves.  The deal cleared the final regulatory hurdle last month
after Cnooc relinquished operating control of rigs in the Gulf
of Mexico. Li said that Chinese companies will increasingly win
foreign acceptance.  “State-owned companies like us have no difference with
western companies in terms of business operations,” Li said.
“China’s state-owned enterprises will be more and more welcomed
by the host countries of natural resources.”  Exceptional Circumstances  The Nexen transaction, which closed Feb. 25, spurred the
Canadian government to say future acquisitions in oil sands by
state-owned foreign companies would be rejected barring
“exceptional circumstances.” Cnooc’s previous attempt to gain
control of U.S. oil and gas assets failed, as the company
abandoned its bid for Unocal Corp. in 2005 after facing
political opposition in  Washington .  The company will release its plan for integrating with
Nexen in the second half of 2013, Chief Financial Officer Zhong Hua said.  Cnooc’s largest domestic offshore field, Penglai 19-3,  was
shut because of a spill in 2011, hindering production growth.
The field resumed operating this year. The Beijing-based company
will increase expenditure on drilling new wells and exploring
for resources by 52 percent in 2013 from 43 percent in the
previous period to boost output.  Control Costs  “The company will continue its efforts to control costs,
enhance profitability and create greater value for our
shareholders,” CEO Li said in the statement. This year Cnooc
will promote “oil and gas exploration in shallow water, deep
water, overseas and unconventional fields, and will push ahead
the project pipeline for 24 new projects under construction.”  Cnooc’s replacement of its oil and gas reserves in 2012 was
“the strongest in over a decade,” said  Neil Beveridge , a Hong
Kong-based analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in an e-mail.  The shares dropped 13 percent in the past year in Hong Kong
trading, compared with a 5.8 percent gain in the benchmark Hang
Seng Index. Beijing-based Cnooc fell 0.8 percent to close at
HK$14.32 yesterday, before the earnings announcement.  The company’s average realized oil price rose 0.7 percent
to $110.5 a barrel. Cnooc doesn’t process crude like state-owned
peer PetroChina Co., whose refining business posted a 43.5
billion-yuan operating loss last year, hurt by price controls.  New Projects  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (386) , Asia’s biggest refiner
and the listed unit of China Petrochemical Corp., will report
its 2012 earnings on March 24.  Cnooc expects to increase production by as much as 2.1
percent this year to 348 million barrels of oil equivalent, the
company said in January. New projects off the Chinese coast
helped produce about 341 million to 343 million barrels last
year, meeting the 335 million to 345 million barrel forecast
announced in October.  Ten new offshore projects in  China  will start in 2013 and
capital spending will rise to between $12 billion and $14
billion, the company said in January.  Cnooc’s capital expenditure plan will secure the company’s
6 percent to 10 percent production growth target for 2011 to
2015, CFO Zhong said yesterday. CEO Li said that most of the new
wells planned won’t be online before the end of the year.  Oil consumption growth may gain 4.8 percent this year to
514 million tons (3.8 billion barrels) as China adds refining
capacity and fills emergency fuel stockpiles, China National
Petroleum Corp., the country’s biggest energy producer and the
parent of PetroChina, said in its annual research report
released in January.  To contact the reporters on this story:
