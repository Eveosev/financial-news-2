Sameer Africa Ltd. (SAME) , a Kenyan tire

full-year profit almost doubled and that the company expects an
even stronger performance this year.  The shares climbed 2.8 percent to 5.60 shillings by 10:43
a.m. in the capital, the highest closing level since June 15,
2011, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. About 40,000

in 2012 from 96.9 million shillings a year earlier, the company
said today. Sales grew 8 percent to 3.96 billion shillings,
according the statement.  “Management remains optimistic that 2013 will remain on a
growth trajectory,” Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank

gross margin widened to 24.1 percent last year from 21.8 percent
in 2011, the bank said.  Sameer has surged 35 percent this year, outperforming the
