Soybean imports by  China , the
world’s biggest buyer, may be less than a forecast by the U.S.
government as weakening demand and delays at Brazilian ports cut
shipments.  China may purchase about 59 million metric tons in the 12
months through September, compared with 63 million tons
projected by  U.S. Department of Agriculture , according to the
median of a survey of three researchers and two traders by
Bloomberg News.  Protests by dock workers and a record backlog at Brazil’s
ports have cut shipments from China’s  second-biggest  supplier.
Declining cooking oil prices and lower profits in the hog
industry have reduced demand for soybean oil and meal. Soybean
futures have fallen 19 percent in Chicago from a record high
reached in September while prices on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange  are 5.2 below their high of the same month.  The USDA may have over-estimated China’s demand, even
before delays in Brazil, Bell Chen, vice president of RJ O’Brien
& Associates LLC, said yesterday in an interview in Kunming,
southwest China. The company provides brokerage services to
Chinese crushers.  China had about 4.85 million tons of imported soybean at
major ports as of last week, compared with 5.35 million tons a
month ago, according to grain.gov.cn, a state-owned market
researcher.  The price of live hogs, China’s main source of meat, fell
11 percent this year through March 6 to 14.52  yuan  ($2.33) per
kilogram, according to data from the National Development and
Reform Commission.  To contact  Bloomberg News  staff for this story:
