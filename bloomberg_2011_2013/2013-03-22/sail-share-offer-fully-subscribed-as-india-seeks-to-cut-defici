Steel Authority of India Ltd. (SAIL) ,
 India ’s biggest state-run maker of the alloy, received demand
for more shares than offered by the government, which set a
 price  last seen more than four years ago.  The one-day sale of stock, the second-worst performer on
the BSE India Metal Index in the past year, got bids for 241.3
million shares as of 3:30 p.m. close, compared with the 240.4
million for sale, according to the BSE Ltd  website . The
government, which owns almost 86 percent of the New Delhi-based
company, yesterday set a minimum price of 63 rupees to sell a
5.82 percent stake.  The  shares  extended six-day fall, declining 0.9 percent to
63.35 rupees, the lowest price since Nov. 24, 2008.  Government asset sales at discounted prices have eroded
stock values, as Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s administration
seeks to bridge the widest  budget deficit  among the biggest
emerging economies. India plans to raise 240 billion rupees
($4.4 billion) from asset sales this fiscal year to help pay for
subsidies and investments in public welfare.  The share is expensively priced even at 63 rupees, Angel
Broking Ltd. analyst Bhavesh Chauhan said in a client note
today, recommending they avoid buying the shares.  The minimum price for shares in  NTPC Ltd. (NTPC) , India’s biggest
utility, was set at 145 rupees on Feb. 6, the day the stock
closed at 151.80 rupees.  National Aluminium Co. (NACL)  shares were sold
at minimum of 40 rupees apiece. The stock of the light-weight
metal producer plunged 8.5 percent to 40.35 rupees, the lowest
price since November 2008 that day.  Steel Authority’s share sale, first planned for the year
ending March 31, 2011 was deferred because of a declining equity
market. The stock ended at 160.96 rupees on March 31.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram last month trimmed
the nation’s share sale target by 20 percent to 240 billion
rupees for the year ending March 31. India has sold shares in
companies including NTPC, National Aluminium, iron ore miner
NMDC Ltd. and oil explorer Oil India Ltd. this fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
