Britain’s state-run National Health
Service may be restricting access to some types of non-urgent
treatment to save money, lawmakers said, expressing concern
about the way spending cuts are being implemented.  Most savings already achieved by the NHS as part of efforts
to narrow the government’s budget deficit have come from
freezing wages, the House of Commons  Public Accounts Committee 
said in a report published in London today. It sees a risk that
local health-care agencies may resort to “simple cost-cutting”
rather than seeking to become more efficient.  “We are concerned that other savings are being achieved by
rationing patients’ access to certain treatments,” the panel’s
chairwoman, opposition Labour Party lawmaker Margaret Hodge,
said in an e-mailed statement. “These include cataract surgery
and hip and knee replacements. These procedures are described as
being ‘of low clinical value,’ but people waiting for these
operations suffer pain and a poorer quality of life.”  The lawmakers said they aren’t satisfied that the
Department of Health is doing enough to transform the way the
NHS works. Data showing the service made efficiency savings of
5.8 billion pounds ($8.8 billion) in 2011-2012 aren’t “fully
reliable,” with only 60 percent of the savings substantiated
using national figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
