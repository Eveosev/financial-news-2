About 83 percent of adults drink
coffee in the U.S., the world’s biggest consumer of the
beverage, up from 78 percent a year earlier, according to the
National Coffee Association’s 2013 survey.  The New York-based group said today in a statement that 63
percent of adults drink coffee every day, compared with 65
percent a year earlier and 58 percent in 2011. The data was
compiled from an online survey of 2,840 respondents from mid-
January to mid-February.  Among respondents 18 to 24 years old, daily consumption
fell to 41 percent from 50 percent. The total for those 25 to 39
years old dropped to 59 percent from 63 percent. The  association 
released the survey results in San Francisco at its annual
conference.  About 13 percent of the U.S. population used the single-cup
format, up from 4 percent two years earlier.  Among those 60 years and older, daily consumption rose to
76 percent from 71 percent, and the total for 40 to 59 years old
climbed to 69 percent from 65 percent.  Daily consumption of gourmet-coffee beverages “remained
strong and steady” at 31 percent of the population, while use
of traditional brands fell to 49 percent from 56 percent.  In New York, arabica-coffee futures have dropped 5.9
percent this year, while robusta prices in  London  have gained 11
percent.  Arabica is grown mainly in Latin America and brewed by
specialty companies including Starbucks Corp. Robusta beans,
used in instant coffee, are harvested mostly in Asia and parts
of  Africa .  Brazil  is the second-biggest coffee consumer, followed by
 Germany , according to the International Coffee Organization in
London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
