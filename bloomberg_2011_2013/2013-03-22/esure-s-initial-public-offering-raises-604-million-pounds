Esure Group Plc  founder Peter Wood
made 198 million pounds ($300 million) in the insurer’s initial
public offering today, three years after buying an increased
stake from Lloyds Banking Group Plc.  The insurer raised 604 million pounds as it offered a 50
percent stake to investors, selling 208 million shares for 290
pence apiece, near the top of the 240 pence to 310 pence range
used to canvas interest, the Reigate, England-based firm said
today in a statement. Esure, which will have a market value of
about 1.2 billion pounds upon listing, will get about 50 million
pounds from the sale and use the money to pay down loans from
Tosca Penta Investments LP.  Lloyds (LLOY) , whose biggest shareholder is the U.K. government,
sold a 70 per stake in Esure, which was inherited after it
bought HBOS Plc in 2008, to Wood and Tosca Penta Investments LP
for 185 million pounds in 2010. That stake would now be worth
840 million pounds based on the IPO valuation. The sale follows
 Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s initial public offering of
Direct Line, the U.K.’s biggest home and auto insurer, in
October. Direct Line shares have since risen 8.4 percent.  Wood, 66, who founded Esure in 2000, cut his stake in the
IPO to 31 percent from 49 percent. Tosca will hold about 12
percent, assuming the overallotment option isn’t exercised, the
company said.  “Today’s pricing is a ringing endorsement of Esure’s
strengths and future prospects,” Wood said in the statement.
“As a premium listed company, Esure will have the right
corporate platform for development.”  Esure is selling shares after reporting that its full-year
pretax profit more than doubled to 115.5 million pounds. The
insurer seeks to beat its competitors by targeting safer
drivers, such as women and people over the age of 30.  Deutsche Bank AG,  JPMorgan Cazenove ,  Canaccord Genuity  and
Numis Securities Ltd. managed the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
