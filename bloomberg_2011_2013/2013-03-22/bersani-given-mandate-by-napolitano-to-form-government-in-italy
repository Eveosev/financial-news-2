Italian President Giorgio Napolitano today asked Democratic Party leader Pier Luigi Bersani to try to form a government, a month after inconclusive elections.  Bersani will consult with other parties in the next few days to muster enough support to form a government that can survive the required confidence votes in both houses of Parliament.  In the Feb. 24-25 election, Bersani won a majority in the lower house though he fell short in the Senate where both Beppe Grillo’s Five Star movement and former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s coalition won blocking minorities.
