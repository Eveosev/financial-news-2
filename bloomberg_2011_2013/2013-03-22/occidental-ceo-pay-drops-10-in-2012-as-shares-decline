Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY) , whose
former chief executive officer was the highest paid energy
executive in 2009, reduced the compensation package for CEO
Stephen Chazen 10 percent last year as shares fell.  Chazen received $28.5 million in salary, bonus, stock and
incentive awards, down from $31.7 million in 2011, according to
a filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
The Los Angeles-based company’s shares declined 18 percent last
year, the  fourth-worst performance  among the 43 members of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Energy Index.  Occidental, the largest onshore oil producer in the
continental U.S., revised its executive compensation plan to
“substantially reduce” payouts after shareholders criticized
former CEO Ray Irani’s pay. Irani, who remains chairman of the
company, received $76.1 million in 2010. He made $45.6 million
last year, down 8.4 percent from 2011.  Irani is planning to retire next year and the company
announced last month that it had begun a search for Chazen’s
successor. Executive compensation for 2012 included incentive
awards that are being phased out under the new pay formula.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the largest U.S. oil company, paid
Chairman and CEO Rex Tillerson $34.9 million in 2011, the most
recent year for which figures are available. Exxon’s market
capitalization is more than six times larger than Occidental’s.  Occidental rose 0.4 percent to $78.70 at 2:46 p.m. in New
York. The company has gained 2.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
