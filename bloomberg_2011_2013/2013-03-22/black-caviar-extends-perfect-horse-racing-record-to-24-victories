Black Caviar, the world’s top-
ranked thoroughbred sprinter, extended her perfect streak to 24
straight victories by winning her record-tying 14th elite
Australian horse race.  The 6-year-old mare, ridden by Luke Nolen and trained by
Peter Moody, beat stablemate Karuta Queen by four lengths to win
the 1,200-meter William Reid Stakes, the final race in last
night’s meeting at  Melbourne ’s Moonee Valley Racecourse that
attracted a crowd of more than 25,000 trackside.  “It’s scary how well she’s going,” Moody said in a
televised interview. “We’re lost for words. In our industry
she’s second-to-none.”  The victory put  Black Caviar , a two-time Australian
Racehorse of the Year, into a tie with Kingston Town at 14 Group
1 wins since the Group and Listed race classification system was
introduced in 1979.  Tabcorp Holdings Ltd. (TAH) ,  Australia ’s largest racecourse
betting company, paid A$1.04 ($1.08) for a winning A$1 bet on
Black Caviar, who has defeated 35 individual Group 1-winning
rivals during her run for career prize money of $7.34 million.  Moody wrote in yesterday’s Herald Sun newspaper that the
plan is to give Black Caviar a “ farewell whistle-stop tour ” of
Australia’s eastern states. Only one of her races has been
overseas, when she won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes in a photo
finish at the U.K.’s Royal Ascot on June 23.  “The only thing I will say is she won’t run anywhere on a
wet track on this farewell tour,” Moody wrote. “Fast horses
for fast tracks. The only time she ran on the wet was in  England 
and she won by a head.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
