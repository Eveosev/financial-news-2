British Broadcasting Corp. may
consider dropping Formula One car racing to avoid axing its BBC4
digital channel amid a freeze on its license fees, the Sunday
Times reported, citing unnamed senior sources.  BBC , which canâ€™t raise fees it charges television watchers
until 2017, spends 60 million pounds ($97.1 million) a year on
Formula One, the  newspaper  reported. The cost of covering 19
races at 3 million pounds each is more than the annual budget of
BBC4, according to the report. The BBC Trust will consider the
proposal later this year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
