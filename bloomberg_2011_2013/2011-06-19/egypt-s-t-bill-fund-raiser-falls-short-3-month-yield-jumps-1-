Egypt  fell 11 percent short of
raising the 6.5 billion Egyptian pounds ($1.1 billion) it
targeted at an auction of treasury bills today as the average
yield on three-month notes jumped the most in two months.  The  Ministry of Finance  sold 3 billion pounds in three-
month securities, the highest amount since Feb. 13, according to
Bloomberg data. It raised 2.79 billion pounds from the sale of
nine-month notes, less than the 3.5 billion it sought, according
to  Central Bank  of Egypt data on Bloomberg.  Egypt has increasingly turned to short-term borrowing to
meet its funding needs to avoid paying high yields in the long
term after a revolt overthrew the government in February. The
average yield on the three-month securities jumped 16 basis
points, the most since an auction on April 20, to 11.761
percent. The yield on nine-month bills gained 4 basis points to
12.944 percent.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent 10-year dollar bond fell
less than 1 basis point, or less than 0.01 percentage point, to
5.71 percent on June 17. The pound was little changed at 5.944
per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
