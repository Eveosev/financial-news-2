Oil fell to the lowest in four
months in New York, heading for a  bear market , on speculation a
weakening global economy and  Greece ’s debt crisis will lead to
reduced fuel demand.  Futures slid as much as 2 percent today, erasing gains made
this year, as European governments failed to agree on releasing
a loan payout to spare Greece from default and Japan’s exports
dropped in May more than forecast. Crude traded for a second day
below its 200-day moving average, a major technical-support
level, and is close to a 20 percent decline from its 2011
settlement high in April, the sign of a bear market.  “The major influence continues to be the European
situation,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, who predicted oil
will average $113 a barrel in the third quarter. “If you look
at what happened to the oil price during the financial crisis
you can see that these events have a big impact. There is this
tone of a global slowing in the economy.”  Crude for July delivery fell as much as $1.87 to $91.14 a
barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . That’s the lowest intraday price since Feb. 22 and is
below $91.38, the final settlement price of 2010. It was at
$91.40 at 3.22 p.m. Singapore time.  Futures are trading 19.8 percent below the 2011 settlement
high of $113.93 on April 29. A 20 percent decline is typically
considered to be an indicator of a bear market. The July
contract expires tomorrow. August futures are down $1.60, or 1.7
percent, at $91.80.  Bollinger Band  Brent oil for August delivery on the London-based ICE
Futures  Europe  exchange fell as much as $1.56, or 1.4 percent,
to $111.65 a barrel. Prices are up 18 percent this year.  Oil in  New York  is trading below its 200-day moving
average, currently at $92.30 a barrel, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Prices are also below the lower Bollinger
Band at $93.58, a technical indicator that may signal the market
has fallen too far.  Euro-area finance ministers pushed Greece to pass laws to
cut its deficit and sell state assets. They left open whether
the country will get the full 12 billion euros ($17.1 billion)
promised for July as part of a bailout package agreed last year,
according to Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker ,
after chairing a crisis meeting in his country. Decisions on the
next payout and a three-year follow-up package were put off
until early next month.  Growth Forecast  Japan ’s exports decreased 10.3 percent from a year earlier
after April’s 12.4 percent drop, the  Finance Ministry  said
today. The median estimate of 25 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was for an 8.4 percent decline.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its forecast for U.S.
growth in 2011, warning of setbacks to the economic recovery
with potential contagion from Europe’s debt crisis.  The U.S. will expand 2.5 percent this year and 2.7 percent
in 2012, down from the 2.8 percent and 2.9 percent projected in
April, the Washington-based fund said June 17. It sees the world
economy expanding 4.3 percent this year, from 4.4 percent in
April.  Hedge funds  and other speculators boosted wagers on crude
rising in the seven days ended June 14, the U.S. Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said in its weekly Commitment of
Traders report. Net-long bets climbed by 3,398 futures and
options combined, or 1.8 percent, to 194,372. That was the first
increase in three weeks.  Crude may decrease this week on signals economic growth in
the U.S. and  China  will slow, curbing fuel use in the world’s
biggest oil-consuming countries, according to a Bloomberg News
survey. Eighteen of 38 analysts and traders, or 47 percent,
forecast prices will decline through June 24.  Thirteen respondents, or 34 percent, predicted oil will
increase and seven estimated there will be little change. Last
week, 54 percent of respondents said futures would drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
