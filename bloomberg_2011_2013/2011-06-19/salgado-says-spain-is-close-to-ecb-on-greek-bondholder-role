Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said
the Spanish government’s position on the role bondholders should
play in any new rescue package for  Greece  is close to the stance
taken by the  European Central Bank .  Salgado spoke to reporters in Luxembourg today before a
meeting of euro area finance ministers on Greece.  On Spain’s position:  “There are some differences between the ECB and some
countries. We are closer to the ECB, but we are available to
work to come to a consensus.”  On voluntary bondholder participation:  “We should follow the Vienna initiative. Basically, if
they have the security that they will redeem the bonds even if
they are postponed, it’s reasonable that they take that route
because the  interest rates  are high.”  “When we say it’s voluntary it’s not reasonable to think
that everyone will follow. There will always be someone that
won’t follow, but if there is a sufficient number the measure
will have worked.”  On today’s talks:  “What we expect today is at least to unblock the next
installment that Greece needs for the next few months.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
