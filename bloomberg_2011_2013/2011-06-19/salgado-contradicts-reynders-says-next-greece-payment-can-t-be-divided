Spanish Economy Minister  Elena
Salgado  said euro area finance ministers are discussing a 12
billion-euro ($17.1 billion) aid payment to Greece after her
Belgian counterpart,  Didier Reynders , said the group may
authorize only half that amount.  “The way the money is distributed has to do with Greece’s
specific refinancing needs,” Salgado told reporters as the
finance chiefs met in Luxembourg late today. “You can’t divide
it. The fifth payment is 12 billion euros.” No one at today’s
meeting proposed authorizing a 6 billion-euro payment, she said.  Salgado said the 6 billion-euro figure refers to Greece’s
refinancing needs in August. “But that’s not what they’re
asking for,” she said. “Greece needs money not only to
refinance its debt but also its budget. The 6 billion are
included in the 12 billion.”  The Spanish minister said private investors don’t need
incentives to participate in a new rescue package for  Greece .
“The idea of many countries is that the private sector has to
assume its share of the problems that Greece has at this
moment.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
