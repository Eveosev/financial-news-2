Rory McIlroy has an eight-shot lead
over Y.E. Yang with five holes left in the final round of golf’s
 U.S. Open .  McIlroy, who’s in search of a first major golf title, is 16
under at Congressional Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland,
further extending his record for the lowest score in relation to
par in the tournament’s 111-year history. The 22-year-old from
Northern Ireland is 2-under par through 13 holes today,
including a birdie at the par-3 10th hole where he hit his tee
shot to within six inches of the cup.  Yang, a South Korean who won the 2009 PGA Championship, is
2-under par for 13 holes and 8 under overall, one better than
Jason Day. Kevin Chappell and Sergio Garcia are 6-under par,
while Lee Westwood and Peter Hanson are 5 under.  McIlroy’s eight-stroke lead after 54 holes was the second-
biggest in U.S. Open history after  Tiger Woods ’s 10-stroke
advantage at Pebble Beach in 2000, when he went on to win by 15
strokes.  While McIlroy has seen leads slip away before in major
championships, no player has blown a cushion of more than five
strokes in the final round at the U.S. Open. McIlroy’s lead
increased to as many as 10 strokes today.  Luke Donald  of  England , the world’s top-ranked golfer,
finished at 5-over par, while  Phil Mickelson  had a double-bogey
at No. 18 to end the tournament at 7 over.  To contact the reporters on this story:
