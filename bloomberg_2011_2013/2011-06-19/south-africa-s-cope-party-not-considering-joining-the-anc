The Congress of the People, formed
in 2008 by dissidents from  South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress , are not considering returning to the ANC,
said the party’s spokesman Sipho Ngwema.  The Johannesburg-based Sunday Times  reported  today that
informal talks were under way between the ANC and COPE, which
may result in the opposition party being absorbed into the
ruling party.  “COPE is not considering joining the ANC but there are
individuals who are engaged in discussions with the ANC for
personal considerations,” Ngwema said from a mobile phone
today.  “We are aware as we speak that there are discussions in
Johannesburg taking place with two prominent ANC leaders and
some of our members mentioned in this article,” he said.  The talks are being led by the ANC’s head of organizing and
campaigns Fikile Mbalula and COPE working committee member and
spokesman Philip Dexter, the Times said.  Dexter and several members of COPE have agreed “in
principle” to return to the ANC and want to push for the entire
party to be absorbed into the ruling party, the Times said.  “They are speaking to the ANC as individuals and have no
mandate to speak on behalf of the party,” Ngwema said.  A spokesperson from the ANC could not be reached for
comment. Neither Mbalula nor Dexter would confirm whether the
talks were taking place, the Times reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
