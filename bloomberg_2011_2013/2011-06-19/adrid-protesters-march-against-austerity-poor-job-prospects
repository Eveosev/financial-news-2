Demonstrators  marched  in Madrid,
converging near the congress building in the Spanish capital and
maintaining the momentum of protests that broke out last month
against government austerity policies and high unemployment.  Six “columns” of marchers from different points of the
city converged at Neptune Square at about 2 p.m., said Dante
Scherma, a spokesman for the 15-M Movement, which helped
organize today’s demonstration. The protest, which attracted
“many thousands” of people, has been peaceful, he said.  It wasn’t immediately possible to speak to  Spain ’s National
Police to get official estimates of the size of today’s
demonstration in Madrid and other Spanish cities. State
 broadcaster  Television Espanola reported that about 500 police
had monitored the “tens of thousands” of protesters and the
 Madrid  rallies had taken place in a “festive” atmosphere.  Protesting against a youth unemployment rate of 44 percent,
bank bailouts and corruption, demonstrators staged a one-month
sit-in at Madrid’s Puerta de Sol that started on May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
