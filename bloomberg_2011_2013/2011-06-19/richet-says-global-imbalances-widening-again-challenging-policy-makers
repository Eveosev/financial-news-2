European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  said a widening of global imbalances poses
challenges for international policy makers.  “A concern is that after some partial reduction induced by
the crisis, global imbalances are starting to widen again,”
Trichet said today in Kiel, Germany, where he was awarded with
the Global Economy Prize of the Kiel Institute for the World
Economy. “This raises challenges for international monetary and
financial cooperation” and “the global economy has a lot of
homework to do if it is to address these challenges.”  The 17-nation euro region doesn’t contribute to global
imbalances and growth divergences between member countries are
“comparable” to those in the U.S., Trichet said. The euro
continues to be a stable currency and the euro area “is not a
closed shop,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
