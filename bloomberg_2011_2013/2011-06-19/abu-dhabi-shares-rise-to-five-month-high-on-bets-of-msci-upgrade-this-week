Abu Dhabi ’s benchmark stock index

Arab Emirates  will be upgraded to emerging market status by  MSCI
Inc. (MSCI)  this week.  Egypt ’s stocks increased.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB)  climbed 1.9 percent after it
said it will make a profit of about 1 billion dirhams ($272

week.  MSCI, which classifies six of the seven Gulf markets as
frontier, will decide on whether to raise the U.A.E. to
emerging-market status on June 21. Bourses in the country said
May 29 that market participants are ready to use an upgraded
trading system, the so-called delivery-versus-payment, meeting
one of the criteria for an upgrade at MSCI.  “In the coming days, all investors are eyeing the MSCI
decision to include the U.A.E.” in the emerging market index,
said Samer Darwiche, a financial analyst at Gulfmena Investments
in Dubai. “All the positivity in the market is related to
that.”  Citadel Gains  Exchanges in the U.A.E. may attract $1.5 billion if the
nation secures the upgrade, Sebastien Henin, who helps oversee
$110 million at The National Investor in Abu Dhabi, said in
April. Frontier-market is a designation that applies to
economies and financial markets that are less developed.  Saudi

review for a reclassification this week. The nation’s benchmark
index gained 0.2 percent.  In North Africa, Egypt’s EGX30 Index advanced 1.6 percent

hire Morgan Stanley as an adviser on the planned acquisition of
a stake in the Egyptian private-equity company, two people
familiar with the situation said June 16 after markets closed.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank added 1.9 percent to 3.29
dirhams, the highest since October 2008. The U.A.E.’s third-
biggest bank by assets on June 17 agreed to sell its 24.9
percent stake in Malaysian lender RHB Capital to Abu Dhabi’s
state-owned Aabar Investments PJSC for 10.80 ringgit a share, or
about 5.9 billion ringgit ($1.9 billion).  Israel  Bonds Fall  Etisalat rose 1.4 percent, the most since Feb. 8, to 11.10

in which payment for a security must be made when the security
is delivered. Usually, the payment is made to a bank, which in
turn pays for the security.  To contact the reporter on this story:
