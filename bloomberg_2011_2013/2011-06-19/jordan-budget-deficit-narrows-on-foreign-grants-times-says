Jordanâ€™s budget deficit narrowed to
46 million dinars ($65 million) in the first five months of 2011
from 137 million dinars a year earlier because of an increase in
foreign grants and government revenue, the  Jordan Times  said.  Grants rose to 315 million dinars by the end of May, up
from 185 million dinars a year earlier, according to the report,
which cited Finance Minister Mohammad Abu Hammour.  -With assistance from Nayla Razzouk in Amman. Editors:  To contact the reporter on this story:
