Egypt ’s wind power capacity may
reach 3,040 megawatts by 2016 as the country seeks to increase
its reliance on renewable energy sources, Electricity and Energy
Minister Hassan Younes said.  The North African country decided to exempt imported
components used in the renewable  energy industry  from duties as
part of wider plan to encourage investment in the field, Younes
said today in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.  Egypt, the most populous Arab country, currently generates
550 megawatts of power from  wind energy . It plans to generate 20
percent of its energy needs from renewable sources by 2020, of
which 12 percent would come from wind power, according to the
ministry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
