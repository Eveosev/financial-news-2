Callum McCarthy, ex-Chairman of the
U.K.’s financial regulator, is planning a new mortgage business
backed by U.S. buyout firm J.C. Flowers & Co. LLC, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The company, Castle Trust, would give customers a 20
percent deposit to buy a home in exchange for 40 percent of any
profit made from a later sale, the  newspaper  reported. The plan,
which hasn’t received approval from the Financial Services
Authority, would raise money for deposits by selling bonds to
retail investors, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
