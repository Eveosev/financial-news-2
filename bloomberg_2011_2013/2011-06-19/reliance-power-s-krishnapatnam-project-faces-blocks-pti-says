Reliance Power Ltd. (RPWR) ’s 4,000-megawatt
power project in Krishnapatnam, Andhra Pradesh state, is facing
road blocks partly because of new Indonesian laws requiring coal
to be sold at market prices, the  Press Trust of India  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  Indonesian coal mines previously had the freedom to
bilaterally agree on coal prices with buyers, the report said.
Other issues affecting the Anil Ambani Group company’s project
include the condition of the soil where the foundation for the
boiler has to be laid, and land disputes at strategic locations,
the report added.  Existing coal supply agreements with the Indonesian coal
mining companies will have to be modified to comply with the new
coal-pricing regulations before September, impacting projects
that depend on imported coal including the one in Krishnapatnam,
the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
