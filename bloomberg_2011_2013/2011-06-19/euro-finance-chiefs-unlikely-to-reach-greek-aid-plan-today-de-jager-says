Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager  said he doesn’t think euro area finance ministers will
agree on a new rescue package for Greece at talks in Luxembourg
today.  “You have the fifth tranche, which depends on the Greek
implementation of austerity measures and the IMF assessment of
that,” De Jager said. “But the real discussion at the moment
is about the possible second program and there lies the real
discussion today. We are going to debate on that and that will
be a very heavy debate.”  De Jager said he sees no need to expand the European
Financial Stability Facility.  “The net value of 750 billion euros is enough, so we
should stick with it,” he said. “Coming out of this crisis,
the most important thing is more austerity measures, more
economic reforms and of course if  Greece  will perform, will
implement all those measures. Then we will be there, if also the
private sector is participating.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
