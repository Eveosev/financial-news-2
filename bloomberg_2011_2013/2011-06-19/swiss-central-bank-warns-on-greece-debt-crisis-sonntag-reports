Swiss central bank Vice President
Thomas Jordan said  Switzerland , which lies outside the eurozone,
has a “large interest” in the containment of debt problems in
 Greece  and other states sharing the currency,  Der Sonntag  said.  “If the whole financial system is affected, this would
have considerable consequences for Switzerland,” he said of a
possible escalation of the debt crisis in peripheral eurozone
nations, the newspaper said, citing Jordan. The report did not
quantify the risk to Switzerland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
