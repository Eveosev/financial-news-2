Turk Telekomunikasyon AS (TTKOM) ,  Turkey ’s
biggest phone company, is increasing its Internet speed to link
to the global web to 1,200 gigabits a second from 650 Gbps to
enable faster connection with the world,  Sabah  reported, citing
its chief executive officer, Gokhan Bozkurt.  The increase in the speed became possible after Ankara-
based Turk Telekom’s acquisition of the international wholesale
business of Hungary’s Invitel Holding A/S, a land-line operator,
Bozkurt said, according to the newspaper. Turk Telekom renamed
the unit Pantel, based in Budapest, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
