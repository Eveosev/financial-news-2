Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank PJSC (ADCB)  rose
to the highest level since October 2008 as the United Arab
Emirates’ third-biggest bank by assets said it will earn about 1
billion dirhams ($272 million) from the sale of its stake in  RHB
Capital Bhd. (RHBC)   The shares increased for a third day, advancing 2.2 percent
to 3.3 dirhams at 11:14 a.m. in Abu Dhabi.  Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank on June 17 signed an agreement to
sell its 24.9 percent stake in Malaysian lender RHB Capital to
Abu Dhabi’s state-owned Aabar Investments PJSC for 10.80 ringgit
a share, or a total of about 5.9 billion ringgit ($1.9 billion).  The deal will be settled in cash one month from the date of
signature, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
