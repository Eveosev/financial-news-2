A  US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  commuter jet
was sequestered after landing near  Washington  because of a bomb
threat, U.S. authorities said. No explosives were found.  Flight 2596 from Dayton, Ohio, landed in a remote section
of Ronald Reagan National Airport in Arlington, Virginia, this
afternoon, the Transportation Security Administration said in a
statement. The  Federal Bureau of Investigation  checked the plane
and interviewed the 44 passengers.  The sweep of bags using bomb-sniffing dogs “resulted in
negative results,” said Nico Melendez, a TSA spokesman. The
person made the threat at a ticket counter in Dayton after the
flight had departed for Washington. The person is in custody and
under investigation, the FBI said.  “We’re working with the TSA, FBI and local law-enforcement
officers to investigate the matter,” Tina Swail, a spokeswoman
for Tempe, Arizona-based  US Airways , said by telephone.  The  plane  landed at 1:13 p.m. local time, 8 minutes later
than scheduled, according to flightstats.com. All flights at
Reagan National were grounded for about 12 minutes around 1:30
p.m., according to a  report  by WTOP.com, a local all-news radio
station that provides traffic and weather.  To contact the reporter on this story:
