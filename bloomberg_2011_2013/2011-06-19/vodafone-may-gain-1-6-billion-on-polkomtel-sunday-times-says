Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) , which owns 24
percent of Poland’s Polkomtel SA, may make 1 billion pounds
($1.62 billion) from the sale of the mobile-phone operator, the
Sunday Times reported, without saying where it got the
information.  The sale, expected in the next two weeks, would mark the
end of Vodafone’s plan to dispose of assets after it previously
sold some holdings in France, China and Japan, the newspaper
reported. Polish billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak is the most
likely buyer for Polkomtel, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
