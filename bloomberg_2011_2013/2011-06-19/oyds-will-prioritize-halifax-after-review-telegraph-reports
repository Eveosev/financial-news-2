Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) ’s Chief
Executive Officer Antonio Horta-Osorio plans to prioritize its
Halifax unit after a review of the bank’s strategy, the Sunday
Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the information.  Horta-Osorio will promote Halifax as the London-based
bank’s prime retail brand when the findings of the review are
released on June 30, the newspaper said. He will retain Lloyds’
Scottish Widows insurance and Scottish Widows Investment
Partnership units and cut jobs as part of a plan to save 2
billion pounds ($3.2 billion), the Sunday Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
