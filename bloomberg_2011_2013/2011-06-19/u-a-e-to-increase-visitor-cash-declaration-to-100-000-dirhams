The  United Arab Emirates  will raise
the limit on undeclared cash visitors can take into the country
to 100,000 dirhams ($27,226) from 40,000 dirhams in September,
the central bank said.  All people entering or leaving the U.A.E. will have to
declare any cash or any other “financial tools” from Sept. 1,
Abdulrahim Mohamed Al Alwadi, executive director and head of the
central bank’s anti-money-laundering unit, said at a conference
in Dubai today.  “This is for statistical purposes only,” he said.  Travelers leaving the U.A.E. now face no curbs on how much
money they can take out. That will also be capped at 100,000
dirhams in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
