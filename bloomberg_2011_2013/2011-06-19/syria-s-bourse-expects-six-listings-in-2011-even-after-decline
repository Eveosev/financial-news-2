Syria ’s Damascus Securities Exchange
expects six companies to list shares in 2011 even after the
index slumped 34 percent amid regional turbulence,  the bourse’s
chief executive officer, Mamoun Hamdan, said.  “The economy was affected by the crisis, which I would say
is a temporary one,” Hamdan said in an interview at his
Damascus office June 15. “The economic sectors in any country
would be affected if this happened” and most companies in
Syria’s bourse are banks, he said. One company should list
shares within a week, he said. Syria’s stock exchange began
operations in March 2009 and has 20 listed companies, 12 of
which are banks.  The DWXX Index slumped 11 percent in March as a wave of
demonstrations in the Arab world demanding reform reached Syria.
The daily average of the value of shares traded has ranged
between 10 million Syrian pounds ($210,712) and 35 million this
year , falling short of a projected 60 million, Hamdan said.  The index surged 21 percent last year. It fell 0.4 percent
to 1,133.09 at the 1 p.m. close in Damascus on June 16. The
maximum fluctuation allowed is 3 percent.  “It’s hard to predict how much we can achieve this year,”
Hamdan said. “Our market is very new. We don’t expect more from
it now, although we aim for more.”  The Arab country’s economy may expand as much as 2.5
percent in 2011, Finance Minister Mohammad Jleilati said June 9.
The nation canceled a sale of 1 billion Syrian pounds of one-
year notes on March 16 as investors sought higher yields. Since
then, it has not auctioned any bonds.  Foreigners can invest in Syria’s stock exchange, though
they must abide by currency regulations and cannot repatriate
full profits until a year after investment. If they withdraw
before that time period, 25 percent to 50 percent of profits
must be paid to the government.  To contact the reporters on this story:
