Fitch Ratings Ltd. welcomes efforts
to give ratings less significance in regulation, Welt am Sonntag
reported, citing an interview with Jens Schmidt-Buergel, who
heads Fitch’s German unit.  That would mean some institutional investors wouldn’t be
forced to sell debt certificates once their rating falls below a
certain level, and help avoid negative effects for the  bond
market , the German newspaper cited Buergel as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
