Boyner Buyuk Magazacilik (BOYNR)  AS, a
Turkish department store chain, may outbid private equity firms
including  Carlyle Group  and Bridgepoint Capital Ltd. to buy a
controlling stake at retailer YKM,  Milliyet  said, without saying
where it got the information.  Istanbul-based Boyner, owned by Boyner Holding AS and
Citigroup’s fund Fennella S.a.r.l., may buy as much as 63
percent of  YKM , owned by Turkey’s Tan and Agrali families, the
newspaper said.  Apart from Carlyle and Bridgepoint, Qatari QInvest LLC and
Turkish private equity firms Esas Holding AS, Turkven and Actera
Group are also interested in the YKM stake sale, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
