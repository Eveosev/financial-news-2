Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
would like to see President  Barack Obama  win a second term in
next year’s U.S. presidential elections, he said in an interview
with the Financial Times.  “I would like Barack Obama to be elected to the post of
president of the  United States  more than, perhaps, anyone
else,” Medvedev said in an e-mailed transcript of a June 18
interview with the FT.  Medvedev also said it’s “hard to imagine” both himself
and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin running for the Russian
presidency, according to the transcript sent by his press
office. “This wouldn’t be the best scenario for our country,”
Medvedev said.  Medvedev didn’t confirm whether he planned to run for the
presidency in the interview, according to the transcript.  To contact the reporters on this story:
