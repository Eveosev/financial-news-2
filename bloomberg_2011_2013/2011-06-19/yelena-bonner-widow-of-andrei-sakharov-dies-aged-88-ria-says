Yelena Bonner, the widow of
physicist, human-rights activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner
Andrei Sakharov, died yesterday at the age of 88, RIA Novosti
reported.  Bonner died in  Boston ,  Massachusetts , after a long illness,
the newswire reported today, citing a report by the Echo of
Moscow radio station.  Bonner had continued the human-rights activism of her
husband since his death in 1989. He won the Nobel peace prize in
1975 and was prevented from attending the award ceremony for
political reasons.  Bonner wrote an  open letter  to President Dmitry Medvedev’s
wife Svetlana and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin’s wife Lyudmila
in October 2008 asking them to “use your high positions so that
a future citizen of  Russia  will be born in freedom.”  Bonner will be cremated and her remains buried at a
cemetery in Moscow next to her husband, mother and brother, RIA
reported, citing a statement from Bonner’s daughter, Tatiana
Yankelevich.  To contact the reporter on this story:
