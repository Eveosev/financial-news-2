South African Airways has resumed
all flights to and from  Cape Town ,  Port Elizabeth  and East
London after canceling them last night because of ash clouds
caused by a volcano in Chile.  All evening flights were canceled from 5 p.m. as a
precautionary measure, Dileseng Koetle, an SAA spokeswoman, said
from a mobile phone today. The Johannesburg-based carrier
accommodated all passengers who missed their flights this
morning, she said.  On June 4, there was an eruption in the Puyehue-Cordon
Caulle volcanic complex in southern Chile that disrupted travel
around the Southern Hemisphere.  To contact the reporter on this story:
