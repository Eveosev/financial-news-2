US Airways Group Inc. (LCC)  said
passengers at its Charlotte Douglas International Airport hub in
North Carolina can expect delays of as much as an hour after its
computer system crashed earlier this morning.  The outage follows a two-hour disruption yesterday to US
Airways’ computers at Philadelphia International Airport and a
power failure on June 10 near a Phoenix data centers that
knocked out its website and airport computer systems.  The systems in Charlotte went down just before 8 a.m. local
time and were restored three hours later, spokeswoman Tina Swail
said. She didn’t know how many flights were canceled or delayed
as a result.  Swail said the carrier is working with its service
providers, mostly  AT&T Inc. (T) , to learn the cause of the outage in
Charlotte. She said neither the Philadelphia nor the Charlotte
outage appear to be the result of attacks by computer hackers.  Yesterday, United Airlines resumed flights after canceling
31 flights Friday and yesterday. A network connectivity issue
led to a five-hour computer outage that stranded passengers in
Chicago, Denver,  San Francisco  and other U.S. cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
