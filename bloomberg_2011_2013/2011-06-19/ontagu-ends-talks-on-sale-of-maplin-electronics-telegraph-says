Montagu Private Equity LLP ended
talks on a possible sale of Maplin Electronics because a slump
in U.K. retail sales depressed the companyâ€™s valuation, the
Sunday Telegraph said, citing an unidentified person close to
the matter.  Montagu intended to sell the company for more than 400
million pounds ($648 million) and had negotiated with  Blackstone
Group LP (BX) , Advent International Corp. and  CVC Capital Partners ,
the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
