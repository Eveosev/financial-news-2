Japanese and Australian  stock
futures  rose on expectations European finance chiefs will reach
agreement on an aid payment to Greece and after a report
signaled U.S. economic growth may pick up by the end of this
year.  American depositary receipts of  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s
largest maker of cameras and which gets about 80 percent of its
revenue outside  Japan , increased 0.3 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo on June 17. Those of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,
the world’s largest carmaker, advanced 0.3 percent after
Citigroup Inc. raised its rating on Japan’s auto sector to
“neutral” from “bearish,” citing a recovery in production.
ADRs of  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC) , an Australian lender, gained 0.8
percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
September closed at 9,365 in Chicago on June 17, compared with
9,340 in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at 9,360
in Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s
S&P/ASX 200 Index gained 0.1 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50
Index increased 0.3 percent in Wellington.  “We are seeing a movement of support for Greece,” said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo. “People now probably expect it is
unlikely Greece will have to restructure its debt because of a
default.”  Euro-area finance ministers may authorize only a 6 billion-
euro loan to tide Greece through bond redemptions in July, while
further aid hinges on Greek budget cuts, Belgian Finance
Minister Didier Reynders said ahead of a euro-area finance
ministers’ meeting today to hammer out a new bailout package.  Financial Rescue  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index slid 0.3 percent
today. In  New York , the index advanced 0.3 percent to 1,271.50
on June 17 as European leaders moved closer to a compromise on a
financial rescue for  Greece , and after an index of leading U.S.
economic indicators advanced more than forecast.  Chancellor Angela Merkel retreated from German demands that
bondholders be forced to shoulder a “substantial” share of a
Greek rescue, saying she’ll work with the  European Central Bank 
to avoid disrupting markets.  “We would like to have a participation of private
creditors on a voluntary basis,” Merkel told reporters in
Berlin on June 17 at a joint press conference with French
President Nicolas Sarkozy. This “should be worked out jointly
with the ECB and there shouldn’t be any dispute with the ECB on
this.”  U.S. Outlook  An index of U.S. leading indicators rebounded in May after
declining for the first time in almost a year, a sign economic
growth may pick up by the end of 2011.  The Conference Board’s gauge of the outlook for the world’s
biggest economy in the next three to six months rose 0.8 percent
after a revised 0.4 percent decline in April, the New York-based
group said on June 17. Economists forecast a 0.3 percent gain,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg News survey.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 5.9 percent this year
through June 17, compared with a gain of 1.1 percent by the S&P
500 and a drop of 3.1 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.2 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 12.8 times for the S&P 500
and 10.8 times for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporters on this story:
