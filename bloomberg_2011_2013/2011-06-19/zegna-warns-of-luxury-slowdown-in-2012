Ermenegildo Zegna SpA, the Italian
maker of $2,645 wool suits, warned of a possible slowdown in
sales of  luxury goods  in 2012 even as it forecast revenue will
grow at least 10 percent this year.  While “cautiously optimistic” about 2011, “I am more
worried about 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Ermenegildo Zegna
said June 18 in an interview before the Trivero, Italy-based
company’s spring-summer 2012 runway show in Milan. “I see
shadows in  Europe , I see a question mark in the  United States , a
relative slowdown in  China .”  Europe’s Stoxx 600 has fallen about 8 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 17 as a slowdown in U.S. job creation
suggests the economic recovery is faltering and speculation
grows that  Greece  will fail to repay all of its debt. Prada SpA,
the Italian maker of Church’s shoes, last week sold shares near
the low end of its target in 2011’s biggest  Hong Kong  initial
public offering, amid a global stock-market slump.  Spending on high-end apparel, accessories and other goods
may rise 8 percent this year to 185 billion euros ($264.7
billion), excluding currency swings, Bain & Co. predicted in
May. Luxury sales in mainland China, which doesn’t include Hong
Kong, Macau or Taiwan, may surge 25 percent to 11.5 billion
euros on the same basis, keeping it the fastest-growing market,
according to the consultant.  “It’s going to be hard to continue growing 30 percent as
we have been growing for the past five years” in China, Zegna
said. Still, the company “remains confident” about its
prospects in the country, he said.  New Stores  Worldwide revenue in Zegna’s own stores has risen 20
percent so far this year, meaning growth of at least 10 percent
is likely for 2011, the CEO said. Zegna posted sales of 963
million euros in 2010 and earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization of 140 million euros.  The suitmaker plans to open 20 stores this year, including
in Paris this week and in  Rome  in November, as it reduces its
dependence on wholesale, Zegna said. While the company has
focused on increasing its retail footprint in China in the past
two years, expansion in 2011 will be “more balanced across the
world,” he said.  Zegna will introduce made-to-order knitwear in its main
stores in September and is also adding private salons in some
stores for its top clients. “I see an incredible opportunity
still in personalized service,” he said.  In December, Zegna opened an  e-commerce  site in partnership
with  Yoox SpA. (YOOX)  The aim is for the virtual store to account for
at least 5 percent of Zegna’s retail sales “in a number of
years,” the CEO said.  The company is focused on internal growth rather than
acquisitions and on men’s wear, Zegna said, also ruling out a
share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
