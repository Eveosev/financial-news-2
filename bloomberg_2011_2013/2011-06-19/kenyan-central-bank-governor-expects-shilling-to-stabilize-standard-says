Kenya ’s shilling is expected to
stabilize once events in the eurozone settle and the East
African country completes its cycle of imports of capital goods,
Central Bank of Kenya Governor Njuguna Ndung’u said.  The central bank monitored events on the domestic  currency
market  last week and found the shilling’s weakening to be “not
justified by what we are seeing,” Ndung’u said in remarks
published in the Nairobi-based Standard on Sunday newspaper
today. Transactions on the market were in the usual range of
$300 million to $350 million a day, he said.  “The bank wishes to assure the market that the panic is
not warranted,” Ndung’u said.  Kenya’s shilling traded at a 17-year-low of 90.95 against
the dollar on June 16. The currency has weakened 10 percent so
far this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
