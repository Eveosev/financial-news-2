Egyptian pounds, the highest level since March 23. Abraaj

Stanley as an adviser on the planned acquisition of a stake in
the Egyptian private-equity company, two people familiar with
the situation said June 16.  Citadel Capital Partners, the main shareholder in Citadel

the two people said, speaking on condition of anonymity because
