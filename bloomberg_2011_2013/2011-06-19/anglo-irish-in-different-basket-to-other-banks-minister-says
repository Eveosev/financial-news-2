Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish
Nationwide Building Society, which took a 34.7 billion-euro
($49.7 billion) bailout, “are in a different basket” to
Ireland’s other lenders, said Social Protection Minister  Joan Burton .  “I find it difficult” that speculative investors who
bought bonds in the two lenders “at 40, 60 and 70 cents in the
euro” should ultimately receive 100 percent of par value,
Burton said in an interview with Dublin-based broadcaster RTE
Radio today.  She was responding to questions on Finance Minister  Michael Noonan ’s comments on June 15 that senior, unguaranteed and
unsecured lenders should share in the losses of the two lenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
