The U.K.’s Serious Fraud Office is
in talks with the  City of London  Police about sharing resources
after the lease on the SFO’s  London  premises expires next year,
the Sunday Telegraph said, citing City of London Police
Commissioner Adrian Leppard.  “We are in active discussions with the SFO about how we
put more formal arrangements in place about our closer working
relationship,” the newspaper cited Leppard as saying. “We are
never going to be a merged organisation but we can do more to
work more efficiently.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
