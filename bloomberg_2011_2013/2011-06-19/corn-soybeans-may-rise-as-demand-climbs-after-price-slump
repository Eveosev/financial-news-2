Corn and soybeans may rise this week
as demand rebounds from producers of food,  animal feed  and
biofuel after price slumps.  Nineteen of 31 traders and analysts surveyed from  Tokyo  to
Chicago on June 17 forecast that corn will climb, and 20 of 32
respondents said soybeans will gain. Last week, corn futures for
December delivery fell 7.4 percent to $6.60 a bushel on the
Chicago Board of Trade, and soybeans for November delivery
declined 3.5 percent to $13.3325 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s drop in soybeans was expected by the majority
of analysts surveyed on June 10, while the slump in corn was a
surprise.  Bullish on corn: 19    Bullish on soybeans: 20
Bearish on corn: 12    Bearish on soybeans: 12  To contact the reporter on this story:
