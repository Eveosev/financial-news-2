Investors’ selectivity and concern
about returns will drive 20 percent of private-equity managers
out of business, according to a survey by Coller Capital Ltd.  The Global Private Equity Barometer, published today by
London-based Coller, found that one in five firms won’t be able
to raise another fund within the next seven years. The study
polled 110 private-equity investors around the world.  Pensions, endowments and sovereign funds, known in the
industry as limited partners, are looking to pare their number
of relationships, Coller partner Frank Morgan said in a
telephone interview. The global financial crisis, triggered by
the September 2008 failure of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
left private-equity funds unable to liquidate investments and
eroded returns for the industry.  “People are going to be more cautious and selective,”
Morgan said. “They’re going to concentrate a greater amount of
money to fewer managers.”  About 27 percent of those surveyed plan to increase their
allocations to private-equity funds in the next 12 months, while
12 percent predicted they’ll reduce commitments. Managers are
hitting the road for new pools amid a more stable landscape.  “These funds have recovered better and faster than people
expected,” said Morgan, whose company buys investments from
private-equity firms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
