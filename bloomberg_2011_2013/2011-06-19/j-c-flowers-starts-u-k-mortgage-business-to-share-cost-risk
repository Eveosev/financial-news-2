J.C. Flowers & Co., a U.S. private-
equity firm specializing in the financial-services market, said
it’s backing a new business that will share the cost and risk of
home ownership.  The new company, Castle Trust, will “unlock the housing
market” by offering investments to retail and institutional
investors, New York-based J.C. Flowers said in a statement
today. The business, which has been two years in the making,
needs approval from Britain’s financial regulator, it said.  “The housing market is the largest asset class in the
U.K.,” Castle Trust Chief Executive Officer Sean Oldfield said
in the statement. “Castle Trust has been designed to help
customers with the two most important financial decisions in
their lives -- investing their savings and buying their home.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
