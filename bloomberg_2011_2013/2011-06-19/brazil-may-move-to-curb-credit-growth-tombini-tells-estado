Brazil  may adopt new measures to
curb the expansion of credit should inflation or “bubble”
risks emerge, O Estado de S.Paulo reported, citing an interview
with Alexandre Tombini, president of the country’s central bank.  Interest rate increases, spending cuts and measures to slow
credit that are already in place will help meet the country’s
target for the control of inflation by the end of next year,
Tombini said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
