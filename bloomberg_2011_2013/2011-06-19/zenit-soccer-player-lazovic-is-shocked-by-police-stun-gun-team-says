Zenit St. Petersburg striker Danko
Lazovic was shocked with a stun gun by Nizhny Novgorod police
after a soccer game against FC Volga in the western Russian
city, Zenit said in a  statement  on its website late yesterday.  Lazovic, who has played for the Serbian national team, was
hit by a local policeman’s electroshock weapon after trying to
throw his shirt into the crowd in celebration at his team’s 2-0
win yesterday, Zenit said in the statement. He received a first-
degree burn and electrical trauma, Zenit, the Russian top-
division champion, said in a separate  statement  today.  The incident “has an extremely negative effect on the
image of Russian football,” Zenit said in yesterday’s
statement. “FC Zenit asks the Russian Football Union and the
Russian Football Premier League to take all measures to protect
players and fans.”  Officers were standing between Lazovic and the spectators
“for his protection” after the match, and one of them had a
stun gun in his raised arms,  Russia ’s Interior Ministry said in
a  statement  on its website today. About 1,700 people were
involved in maintaining public order at the match, including 350
interior-ministry troops, the ministry said in the statement.  “You shouldn’t confuse a stadium with a weapons testing
ground,”  Alexei Miller , chief executive officer of OAO Gazprom,
told Zenit today, the soccer team said.  Gazprom is Zenit’s main sponsor, according to the team’s
 website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
