Investors should buy LG Display
Co.’s bearish options because the world’s second-largest maker
of flat screens may extend losses as television demand slows,
 Morgan Stanley (MS)  equity derivatives strategists said.  Viktor Hjort  and Gaurav Rastogi recommended buying three-
month over-the-counter put options giving the right to sell LG
shares at 10 percent below the current level. Shares of the
Seoul-based company slumped 6.8 percent to a two-year low of
28,200 won on June 17 after UBS AG cut its rating on the liquid-
crystal-display industry.  LG faces slowing TV demand, industry “overcapacity’ and
lower panel prices, the strategists said in a June 17 report
citing stock analyst Keon Han’s expectation that the company
risks missing 2012 analysts’ earnings estimates. Han rates LG at
‘‘underweight” and has a one-year share-price forecast of
23,000 won, or 18 percent below the last close, according to the
report. LG has a “buy” or equivalent rating from 35 of 44
analysts tracked by Bloomberg.  Implied volatility, the key gauge of option prices, for at-
the-money options expiring in three months is 32, the
strategists said. That’s close to its average over the past year
and about the same as realized volatility over the past month,
they said.  “Sluggish” television demand stems from an economic
slowdown in the  Europe  and the U.S., and a recovery won’t come
in the near term, Shinyoung Securities Co. said in a June 17
report. LG Display had a net loss of 115.4 billion won ($107
million) in the three months ended in March.  The company’s shares have tumbled 29 percent this year,
compared with a 0.3 percent drop in the benchmark  Kospi Index. (KOSPI) 
LG Display rose 0.5 percent today, halting an eight-day, 17
percent decline. It was the stock’s longest losing streak since
September 2006.  To contact the reporter on this story:
