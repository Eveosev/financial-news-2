Boeing Co. (BA)  is leaning toward a
bigger version of the  787 Dreamliner  as the U.S. company seeks
to out-maneuver Airbus SAS in a widebody jetliner market it
reckons will be worth almost $2 trillion over the next 20 years.  The 787-10 could enter service by 2016,  Jim Albaugh ,
Boeing’s commercial airplanes chief, said yesterday ahead of the
 Paris Air Show . That would provide competition for Airbus’s
A350-900 and steal a march on the larger A350-1000, which won’t
be ready until 2017, according to a schedule announced June 18.  “We have to go through some more analysis and we haven’t
decided yet if we’ll offer it, but it wouldn’t surprise me if we
did,” Albaugh said in an interview in the French capital.  Building the 787-10 would help Boeing counter the A350’s
threat in markets where the company’s 777 -- which captured the
first widebody orders at the show today -- is dominant, giving
it a breathing space to upgrade a design that debuted in the
1990s. The largest Dreamliner would seat as many as 330 people,
versus 210 to 250 for the 787-8 variant currently in production
and 250 to 290 for the planned 787-9. Airbus’s A350-series
planes will be able to carry between 250 and 400 passengers.  “The A350-900 is aimed directly at the 777-200ER, and the
787-10 would be a good way of defending that turf,” said
 Richard Aboulafia , vice-president of Teal Group, a Fairfax,
Virginia-based consulting company. “It means they can attack
the replacement market, which is very important.”  Show Prospects  Boeing, based in  Chicago , received the first major order at
the Paris expo with a contract from Qatar Airways Ltd. for six
777-300ER long-distance planes that’s worth $1.7 billion at list
prices.  Qatar Air, the second-biggest Middle Eastern carrier, has
25 777s with 15 more already due for delivery and regards the
model as the “backbone” of its long-haul fleet, Chief
Executive Office Akbar al Baker said today after a press
briefing.  Albaugh said separately in a Bloomberg TV interview today
that Boeing will have “a number of announcements” for orders
at the Paris show this week, including “a few” for its single-
aisle 737, which faces competition from Airbus’s re-engined
A320neo. Qatar Air could place some orders for the neo, al Baker
said.  Boeing is seeking to catch Airbus after its rival remained
world No. 1 last year, delivering a record 510 planes, 48 more
than the U.S. company. Airbus is also top by orders, winning
contracts for 644 jets, with 70 cancellations giving a net
intake of 574. Boeing won 530 net orders after 95 cancellations.  Niche Appeal  Toulouse, France-based Airbus is delaying introducing the
A350-1000 by 18 months to add range and payload. The 787-10
won’t match that model for distance, said  Nick Cunningham , an
aerospace analyst at Agency Partners in  London , but will fill a
“high-capacity, shorter-range niche” and may appeal to
carriers that have already signed up for the two smaller
variants.  The 787-10 would be about 15 percent bigger than the 787-9,
seating about 40 more passengers, Boeing executives said. Its
operating costs would be 10 percent lower than the A350-900 and
5 percent lower than the A350-1000, Nicole Piasecki, Boeing’s
head of business development, said in a briefing today.  “Our customers are very interested in this airplane, and
we’re in the process now of deciding when to put it into
service,” Piasecki said.  Longer Term  Boeing is focused on developing models for the longer term
and won’t merely react to moves at Airbus, Albaugh said in a
briefing. Its rival’s decision to build a re-engined A320
narrowbody and the more powerful A350 won’t necessarily push
Boeing to follow suit with the 737 and 777, he said.  “If we were thinking tactically it might drive us in that
direction, but I think we’re thinking more strategically and
long-term,” he said, adding that a new single-aisle plane
should last 50 years. “We will have an answer on the 777;
whether increments or a significant derivative remains to be
seen.”  Boeing will evaluate the timetable and performance of the
A350-1000 before reaching a conclusion regarding the 777.  “The issue is whether they decide to respond with a 777
upgrade or replacement,” said Cunningham. “They won’t do two
programs at the same time.”  Aboulafia said a launch decision for the 787-10 won’t in
itself protect the market occupied by the longest-range 777.  “It’s what you do a notch up from that that’s the
question,” he said. “It’s not quite the same as having a
definitive answer on the 777-300ER front.”  GE90 Engine  General Electric Co. will begin testing a new compressor
next year with a view to developing its GE90 engine in order to
be ready when Boeing decides the next step for 777, GE Aviation
CEO  David Joyce  said today in Paris. GE is currently the
exclusive provider of engines on the 777 extended-range models.  Joyce said he’s not surprised that Airbus is delaying the
A350-1000 so that Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc can improve the
performance of the Trent XWB engine that powers the twinjet.  “It’s playing out a lot like we thought it would,” he
said. “We never thought you could have one engine that spans
the size of those aircraft.”  No Delay  A verdict on whether to offer an all-new narrowbody or opt
to re-engine the 737 will be reached “probably by the end of
the year,” Albaugh said.  “We’re not going to be rushed into a decision,” he said
in the television interview. “I don’t think there has really
been a delay. We’re really trying to get this right. By the end
of the year we should have a decision.”  The Alenia Aeronautica unit of  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC)  will retain
the “opportunity” to work on the horizontal stabilizer on the
787-9, the second Dreamliner variant to be developed, though as
second-source manufacturer, Albaugh said. Flaws with stabilizers
made by Alenia contributed to the program’s three-year delay,
though he said the Italian company’s production has improved.  Alenia has said that it would have to approve any
reallocation of work, since it has design and production rights.  It’s a “horse race” as to whether the initial Dreamliner
version, the 787-8, or the  747-8 , an upgrade of the 41-year-old
jumbo jet, commence deliveries first, Albaugh said. Both are
slated for handover by September.  Boeing is 97 percent-done with certification testing on the
787, and all six test jets have completed what’s needed for
approval by the U.S.  Federal Aviation Administration , according
to Albaugh. Tests for function and reliability and extended
operations will begin this month, he said.  For the 747-8 freighter, about one-third of the scheduled
300 hours of function and reliability tests are done, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
