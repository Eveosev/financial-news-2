Euro-area finance ministers reached
no agreement on a scheduled 12 billion-euro ($17.1 billion) aid
payment to  Greece , Belgian Finance Minister  Didier Reynders 
said.  “The latest tranche normally should be released in mid-
July on the basis of a decision we take in early July,”
Reynders told reporters in Luxembourg after a euro group meeting
that ended early today.  This is because “we are now starting the negotiations on
the participation of the private sector on a voluntary basis”
in a second bailout package for Greece and “we have to wait for
the decision of the Greek parliament on the enactment of the
plan.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
