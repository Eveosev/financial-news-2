Israel ’s short-term CPI-linked bonds
declined for a second day as inflation expectations moderated
after consumer prices in May rose less than forecast.  The CPI-linked bonds due June 2013 fell 0.1 percent with
the yield unchanged at 1.02 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close,
according to  Tel Aviv Stock Exchange data . The yield on the
fixed-rate Mimshal Shiklit bond due January 2020 climbed two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 5.21 percent.  “That indicates inflation expectations were too high,”
said Moshik Yaniv, head of the local fixed-income desk at Migdal
Capital Markets Ltd. in Tel Aviv.  Annual inflation accelerated to 4.1, below the 4.2 percent
median-economist estimate on Bloomberg, the  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said June 15. The Bank of Israel has increased
lending rate four times this year in a bid to curb rising
prices.  The shekel strengthened 0.9 percent to 3.4312 per dollar on
June 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
