Belgian Finance Minister  Didier
Reynders  raised the prospect of finance ministers reaching a
deal on payment of only half of the 12 billion-euro ($17.2 
billion) next installment to Greece.  “I’m only saying that financing has to be released by the
 International Monetary Fund  and the European Union,” Reynders
told reporters in Luxembourg today. “That’s the short-term. We
will in any case try to release the necessary funds for the
short-term, which should happen with a financing of a bit less
than 6 billion euros in the beginning of July.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
