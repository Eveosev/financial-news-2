Jane Norman Holdings Ltd. is in
rescue talks with private-equity firms Sun Capital Partners Inc.
and Better Capital LLP, the Independent on Sunday reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The talks were led by Jane Norman’s lenders, including
Royal Bank of Scotland Plc, while PricewaterhouseCoopers was
hired last month to advise on the apparel retailer’s future, the
 newspaper  said. A group of 15 banks took control of 80 percent
of Jane Norman’s shares in 2009 and restructured its 136
million-pound ($220 million) debt, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
