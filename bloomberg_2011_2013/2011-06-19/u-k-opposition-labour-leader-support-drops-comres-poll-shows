U.K. Labour Party leader  Ed Miliband 
has seen support for his leadership of Britain’s political
opposition drop in the past month.  A  ComRes Ltd. poll  for the Sunday Mirror and Independent on
Sunday newspapers showed the number of respondents who disagreed
Miliband was “a good leader” exceeded those who agreed by 27
percentage points in June, compared with 17 percentage points
last month, ComRes said in statement released in  London  today.  Miliband has faced criticism for failing to inflict more
political damage over Prime Minister David Cameron’s budget cuts
after he beat his brother, David, in the contest to replace
 Gordon Brown  as Labour leader in September. Still, a  YouGov Plc
poll  for the Sunday Times newspaper today found 42 percent of
voters would select Labour if a general election were held now,
with 37 percent supporting the ruling  Conservative Party .  The proportion of the 2,008 Britons questioned in the
ComRes poll agreeing Miliband was a good leader fell to 18
percent this month, compared with 22 percent in May. The
percentage who disagreed he was a good leader rose to 45 percent
from 39 percent. The polling company interviewed British adults
online between June 15 and June 16.  YouGov surveyed 2,451 Britons on June 16 and June 17.
Neither poll included a margin of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
