Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (TEVA) 
slid the most in 11 months after declining in the U.S. in the
last two trading days.  Teva retreated 4.8 percent, the most since July 2010, to
162.50 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . The company’s
American depositary receipts finished at $47.49 in the U.S. on
June 17.  Both Gilad Alper, a senior analyst at Meitav Ltd., and
Jonathan Kreizman, an analyst at Tel Aviv-based Clal Finance
Brokerage Ltd., said Teva’s Israeli share decline followed the
earlier drop in the U.S. “The share is leveling up” with the
American depositary receipt, Kreizman said by telephone.  Teva, which agreed to buy Cephalon Inc. in May for $6.2
billion to insure future growth, sees 21 percent of its revenue
coming from the multiple-sclerosis medicine Copaxone, which is
facing increasing competition. Mylan Inc. said on June 17 that a
U.S. District Court had decided to go ahead with a trial
regarding Copaxone, an announcement Alper said was bad news for
Teva.  Also on June 17, Teva won an appeals-court order that
temporarily prevents  Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. (WPI)  from selling a
generic version of the contraceptive Seasonique.  Teva has dropped 12.6 percent this year, compared with a
9.1 percent decline for the benchmark TA-25 Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
