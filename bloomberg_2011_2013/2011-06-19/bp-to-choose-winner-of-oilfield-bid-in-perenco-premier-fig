BP Plc (BP/)  will decide this week on the
winning bidder for a stake in the Wytch Farm oil and gas fields
after  Premier Oil Plc (PMO)  challenged Perenco SA’s offer, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  BP agreed in May to sell a controlling stake in the U.K.
asset -- western Europe’s biggest onshore oilfield -- to
France’s Perenco for $610 million, the newspaper reported.
Premier, the North Sea oil explorer, made a competing offer this
month, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
