Sri Lanka reached 112-3 at the close
on the fourth day of the final cricket Test against England and
trails by 81 runs.  Ian Bell  scored an unbeaten century for the
hosts.  Captain Kumar Sangakkara has 44 runs and Rangana Herath is
on 2. Tharanga Paranavitana, Lahiru Thirimanne and Mahela Jayawardene were dismissed for 10, 38 and 6, respectively.
England had declared its first innings on 377-8 this afternoon
at Southampton, southern England.  Bell made 119 not out to give England a chance of victory
in a match that’s been disrupted by outbreaks of rain. Kevin Pietersen made 85, Alastair Cook 55 and Eoin Morgan 71. England
resumed at 195-4 today and a full day’s play was possible for
the first time.  Chris Tremlett  took 6-48 as Sri Lanka made 184 all out in
its first innings.  The draw is the favorite result on betting exchange Betfair
amid concern there may be more rain tomorrow.  England leads the three-match series 1-0, after winning the
first match in Cardiff. The second Test, at Lord’s in  London ,
was drawn.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
