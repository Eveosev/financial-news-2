Greece ’s ratification of the medium-
term fiscal adjustment plan is required before the  International
Monetary Fund  can pay its part of a 12 billion-euro ($17.2
billion) loan, Kathimerini reported, citing Greece’s
representative to the fund, Panagiotis Roumeliotis.  The fund will accept a “political commitment” from the
European Union to cover Greece’s financing gap next year to make
the payment and details of financing to 2014 can be worked out
by September, the Athens-based newspaper quoted Roumeliotis as
saying.  The new package will be about 87 billion euros, and less if
the private sector is involved, Kathimerini quoted Roumeliotis
saying. Roumeliotis expects the IMF board to discuss the fifth
portion on July 1 and approve the payment on July 8, Kathimerini
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
