The International Energy Agency
invited Russia together with OPEC to join its effort to “broker
a peace” between buyers and sellers of crude oil amid rising
prices, the Observer reported, citing the agency’s chief.  Russia and the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries can help solve problems such as  climate change  and
energy security, Executive Director Nobuo Tanaka told the
Observer in an interview. “We all really have a common
interest,” he said, according to the report. The IEA’s appeal
to Russia has run into opposition from the country’s state-run
oil company  Gazprom OAO (GAZP) , the  newspaper  reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
