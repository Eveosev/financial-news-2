For the second time since the bull
market began, profits are surging and stocks are falling.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies will earn 18 percent
more this year than in 2010, according to the average estimate
of more than 9,000 analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Higher
profits haven’t stopped the gauge from falling 6.8 percent since
April 29, pushing valuations to the cheapest levels in 26 years.
Even if companies posted no growth, price-earnings ratios would
be lower than on 96 percent of days in the past two decades.  The combination of China raising  interest rates , concerns
about a Greek default and the end of the  Federal Reserve ’s $600
billion stimulus program have almost wiped out this year’s
gains. The divergence between profit forecasts and economic
indicators shows the challenge to investors after the  S&P 500 
gained 88 percent from a 12-year low in March 2009.  “The market is not willing to pay for future growth,”
said Nigel Holland, who helps oversee $516 billion at Legal &
General Group Plc in London. “Provided there is better data, it
will stabilize,” he said. “The market probably has room to
rise 10 percent by year-end.”  The S&P 500 climbed less than 0.1 percent to 1,271.50 last
week, snapping its longest retreat since 2008, after reports on
jobless claims, retail sales and Chinese industrial production
exceeded economists’ forecasts and German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  retreated from demands that bondholders be forced to
swallow losses in a Greek rescue.  The S&P 500 advanced 0.5 percent to 1,278.36 at 4 p.m. in
 New York  today.  Longest Streaks  Equities also got a boost as retailers Best Buy Co. and
 Kroger Co. (KR)  said they would match or exceed predictions for 2011
income. The advance pared the S&P 500’s loss from its 2011 peak
of 1,363.61 on April 29 to 92.11 points.  At 34 days, the decrease is the second longest since the
bull market began. The 16 percent tumble from April to July 2010
lasted 49 days, Bloomberg data show. This year’s retreat has
coincided with a decline in predictions for 2011 gross domestic
product growth to 2.6 percent from 3.2 percent, according to the
median estimate of 83 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Losses since April have pushed the price of the S&P 500 to
14.5 times the past year’s earnings, compared with the average
of 20.5 since June 1991, according to Bloomberg data. The gauge
is valued at 8.7 times cash flow, cheaper than in 81 percent of
occasions since 1998. The gauge is priced at 2.1 times book
value, or assets minus liabilities, lower than it has traded 90
percent of the time since 1995.  Not Excessive  “Even in the assumption that earnings growth is zero,
valuations would not be excessively high,” said Patrick Moonen,
who helps manage $537 billion at ING Investment Management in
 The Hague ,  Netherlands . “We are below consensus in the
estimated earnings growth, and still think the corporate
momentum is very strong.”  Disappointing reports since May on housing, employment and
manufacturing have heightened concerns that $600 billion in
Treasury purchases by the Fed have failed to bolster growth. The
S&P 500 posted its biggest weekly decline since August in the
period that ended June 3 after the U.S. jobless rate
unexpectedly climbed to 9.1 percent and payrolls expanded at the
slowest pace in eight months. A report from the  Institute for
Supply Management  on June 1 showed that manufacturing expanded
at the lowest rate in more than a year.  Greek Swaps Soar  The cost of insuring against defaults on Greek, Irish and
Portuguese government debt surged to records last week on
concern governments will fail to impose spending cuts needed for
a European Union debt restructuring.  Credit-default swaps on  Greece  soared as much as 459 basis
points to 2,237 on June 16, according to CMA prices, meaning it
cost more than 2 million euros ($2.9 million) a year to insure
10 million euros worth of the nation’s debt.  They traded at 1,932.75 basis points as of 4:30 p.m. in
London on June 17 as Merkel backed down from her demands and
said she’d work with the  European Central Bank  to avoid market
disruptions.  Investors are concerned about slowing growth in the U.S.
and  Europe ’s sovereign debt crisis at the same time policy
makers in  China , the world’s second-largest economy, are trying
to cool expansion. The country’s central bank has raised the
reserve-requirement ratio for lenders 11 times and boosted
interest rates four times since the start of 2010 to keep
inflation in check.  Lehman, 1980s  Analysts are boosting profit forecasts even with the global
economy showing signs of weakness. S&P 500 earnings may rise to
$99.61 a share in 2011 from $84.58 last year and $61.52 in 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s an increase from
the forecast of $95.37 on Jan. 3 and $98.70 on April 29, the
data show.  Should stocks stay at current prices and the analyst
prediction come true, the S&P 500 would trade at 12.8 times
income on Dec. 31, the lowest level since 1985 except for the
six months after Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.’s bankruptcy in
September 2008 and nine months in the late 1980s, according to
Bloomberg data. Companies in the S&P 500 are forecast to earn
$24.31 this quarter, up from $24.16 at the start of April.  Concern the slowdown will lead to another recession will
weigh on stocks even as companies report higher income, said
Doug Cliggott, Boston-based equity strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG. He said the S&P 500 will be little changed through
year-end.  Not Extreme  “We wouldn’t put the market now as extremely rich or in a
sense extremely attractively valued,” Cliggott said in an
interview on Bloomberg Television’s “InsideTrack” with Deirdre Bolton on June 13. “Price-earnings multiples will be at or
below their historical averages because of all the uncertainties
on future growth.”  Stocks may also have to do without more stimulus from the
Fed, which will complete its second round of Treasury purchases
this month. While Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said during a
June 7 speech in Atlanta that record monetary stimulus is still
needed to boost the “frustratingly slow” U.S. economic
recovery, he gave no indication that the central bank will start
a third round of so-called quantitative easing.  Retreats in the S&P 500 that exceed 5 percent are common
during bull markets, according to data from Birinyi Associates
Inc., the Westport, Connecticut-based money manager and research
firm. During the nine rallies between 1962 and 2007, the S&P 500
fell that much an average of seven times, the data show. The
index has posted nine such retreats during the current advance.  ‘Strong Backbone’  Global investors increased their cash holdings to the
highest level in a year this month as  hedge funds  slashed the
amount of borrowed money invested in stocks, a survey from  Bank
of America Corp. (BAC) ’s Merrill Lynch unit showed on June 14.  “Valuation is a strong backbone,” ABN Amro Private
Banking Chief Investment Officer Didier Duret, who manages about
$200 billion in Geneva, said in a telephone interview. “It’s
more or less a reflection of how reluctant investors have been
to get back into the equity market.”  Kroger in Cincinnati rose 4.5 percent, the most since
October 2009, to $23.99 on June 16. The largest U.S. grocery
chain increased its fiscal 2012 earnings forecast to as much as
$1.95 a share from $1.92. Analysts, on average, estimated $1.90.  Best Buy, the world’s biggest consumer-electronics
retailer, rallied 4.6 percent two days earlier after reporting
profit that exceeded analysts’ forecasts, helped by rising
demand for smartphones. The Richfield, Minnesota-based company
reiterated its full-year projection for earnings per share of
$3.30 to $3.55, excluding restructuring costs. Analysts
predicted $3.47.  To Alison Porter at Ignis Asset Management, stocks have
priced in prospects for a Greek default and the end of the Fed’s
bond-buying program.  “We are seeing stable growth, but it is not a strong
cyclical recovery,” said Porter, who as U.S. equities fund
manager in Glasgow helps oversee $123 billion. Still,
“valuations in the market should provide some support,” she
said. “Equities are reasonably well positioned from here.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
