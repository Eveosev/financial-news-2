U.S. cyclist Levi Leipheimer of the
RadioShack team won the Tour of  Switzerland  after the ninth and
final stage, Agence France-Presse reported.  Leipheimer finished third in today’s 32.1-kilometer (19.9-
mile) time trial around Schaffhausen, 13 seconds behind winner
Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, AFP added. That was enough to
take him ahead of overnight leader Damiano Cunego of Italy in
the overall standings. Andreas Kloden of  Germany  came second
today.  Cunego finished second overall, only four seconds behind
Leipheimer. Steven Kruijswijk of the Netherlands was third, 1
minute 2 seconds behind the winner.  The event is a warm-up for the Tour de France, which starts
July 2.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
