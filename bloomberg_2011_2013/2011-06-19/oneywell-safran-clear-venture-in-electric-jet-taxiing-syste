Honeywell International Inc. (HON)  and
 Safran SA (SAF)  plan to provide aircraft with a system that lets them
use electrical power to move the jet on the ground, helping
airlines save as 4 percent of total fuel consumption.  The technology will be available from 2016 for new aircraft
and for customers who wish to retrofit the system, the companies
said in a statement today. The taxiing system relies on the
jet’s auxiliary power unit to provide power to specialized
motors near the main landing-gear wheels. Aircraft now rely on
the main engines to power the wheels.  “By using the new electric green taxiing system to provide
the power needed for ground-level manoeuvring, Honeywell and
Safran can save our airline customers several hundred thousand
dollars per aircraft per year,” the companies said in a
release.  Boeing Co. (BA)  and Airbus SAS are among companies discussing
the technology with the joint venture, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
