Rory McIlroy completed a record-
setting performance at golf’s  U.S. Open  by winning his first
major championship by eight strokes.  McIlroy shot a 2-under-par 69 today at Congressional
Country Club in Bethesda, Maryland, to finish at 16 under 268
overall, the lowest winning score in relation to par in the
tournament’s 111-year history. His margin of victory is the
fourth-largest at the U.S. Open.  The 22-year-old McIlroy, of Northern Ireland, is the
youngest U.S. Open champion since Bobby Jones in 1923 and his
victory comes two months after he blew a four-stroke lead in the
final round of the  Masters Tournament .  Jason Day of Australia finished second at 8-under par,
matching his runner-up finish at the Masters. Lee Westwood of
England, Y.E. Yang of  South Korea  and Americans Kevin Chappell
and Robert Garrigus tied for third at 6 under.  McIlroy receives $1.44 million for his second career win in
the U.S. and third worldwide as a professional.  To contact the reporters on this story:
