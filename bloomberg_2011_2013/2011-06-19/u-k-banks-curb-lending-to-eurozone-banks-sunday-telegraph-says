Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Standard Chartered Plc (STAN) 
and other U.K. financial institutions may be creating a new
“credit crunch” by reducing unsecured lending to eurozone
banks, the  Sunday Telegraph  reported, citing unnamed sources.  Barclays has cut its lending to European banks over concern
that some lenders have large exposures to troubled economies
including Greece, Ireland and Portugal, the newspaper reported
yesterday.  Standard Chartered  has withdrawn tens of billions of
pounds in recent months from the inter-bank lending market in
countries that use the euro and reduced its loans by two-thirds
in the past few weeks, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
