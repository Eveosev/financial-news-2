Barcelona has made formal contact
with Arsenal about signing midfielder Cesc Fabregas, the  Sunday
Mirror  reported, citing the London soccer team’s Chairman Peter Hill-Wood.  “They have spoken to us about Cesc. They have been in
touch. But so far they have not made a bid and we do not want to
let him go,” Hill-Wood was cited as saying. “But he comes from
Barcelona so it is understandable if he wanted to go back.
However, they have not made an offer so far.”  Fabregas, 24, joined Arsenal from Barcelona as a 16-year-
old.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
