Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  plans to sell
its International Financial Services business, which offers
aircraft leasing and other services, the  Sunday Times  reported,
without saying where it got the information.  The Dublin-based bank has hired Dublin-based  Goodbody
Stockbrokers  to find a buyer for the business, which employs 180
people, the newspaper said. AIBIFS also provides “front, middle
and back officer services” for financial institutions and
companies, according to the businesses’ website.  Allied Irish spokeswoman Catherine Burke declined to
comment on the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
