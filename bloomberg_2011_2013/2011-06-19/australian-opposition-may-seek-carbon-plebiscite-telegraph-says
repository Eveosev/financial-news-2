Australiaâ€™s opposition Liberal-
National coalition may introduce a bill to parliament to force
the government to seek voter approval on the introduction of a
carbon tax, the  Daily Telegraph  reported, citing leader  Tony
Abbott . If the bill is passed by both houses, the government
will have 90 days to call the plebiscite, which requires
registered voters to make a decision on the tax, the Telegraph
said. A plebiscite is not binding on a government like a
referendum, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
