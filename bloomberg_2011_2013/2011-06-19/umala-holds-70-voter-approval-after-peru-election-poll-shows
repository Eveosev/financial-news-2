Peru’s President-elect Ollanta Humala held 70 percent approval following his election June 5,
 El Comercio  newspaper reported, citing a poll by Ipsos Apoyo.  Some 60 percent of those surveyed want Humala, an ex-army
officer who edged out Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori for the
presidency, to promote investment in the Andean nation and 55
percent support his fight against corruption, the daily said,
citing Ipsos Apoyo. Most of those polled said they want Humala
to choose a finance minister from outside his political party,
El Comercio reported without providing numbers.  The nationwide poll of 1,200 Peruvians was conducted June
15 through June 17, El Comercio said. The newspaper didn’t
provide a margin of error or provide more details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
