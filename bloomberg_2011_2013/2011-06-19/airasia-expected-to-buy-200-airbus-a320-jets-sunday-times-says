AirAsia Bhd. (AIRA) , Asia’s biggest budget
carrier, is finalizing a “record” $17 billion purchase of 200
Airbus SAS A320 jets, the Sunday Times reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The deal, scheduled to be announced June 23, may dominate
orders at this week’s Paris Air Show, the  newspaper  said. Airbus
is expected to sell more than 500 aircraft during the week,
