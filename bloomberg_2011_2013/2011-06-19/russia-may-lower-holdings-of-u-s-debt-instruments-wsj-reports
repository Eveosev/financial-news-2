Russia will probably reduce its
holdings of  U.S. debt , the Wall Street Journal said, citing a
June 18 interview with Arkady Dvorkovich, President Dmitry Medvedev’s economic adviser, published by Dow Jones Newswires.  “The share of our portfolio in U.S. instruments has gone
down and probably will go down further,” Dvorkovich told Dow
Jones in  St. Petersburg  yesterday, the newspaper  reported  on its
website.  The safety of investments in U.S. debt is the same now as
it was ten years ago “on an absolute basis,” Dvorkovich told
Dow Jones, the Journal said. “On a relative basis, compared to
other investments, of course not.”  “When we take decisions and compare, we’re not thinking in
absolute terms,” he said, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
