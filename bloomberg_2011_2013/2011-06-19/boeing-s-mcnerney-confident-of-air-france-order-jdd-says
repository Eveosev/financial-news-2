Boeing Co. (BA)  is confident to win a
“significant portion” of an order for wide-body aircraft from
Air France SA even as French members of parliament push to pick
Airbus SAS, Le Journal du Dimanche reported, citing Boeing Chief
Executive Officer Jim McNerney.  Air France has always shown that it is driven by technology
in choosing its aircraft, the newspaper cited McNerney as
saying.  Bernard Carayon, a member of President Nicolas Sarkozy’s
Union for a Popular Movement Party, has led a group urging Air
France CEO Pierre-Henri Gourgeon to choose Airbus’s A350 instead
of Boeing. Gourgeon has said the airline would be likely to
split the order.  To contact the reporter on this story:
