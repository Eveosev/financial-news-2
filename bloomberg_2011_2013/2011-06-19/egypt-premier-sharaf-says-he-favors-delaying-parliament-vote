Egypt’s interim Prime Minister Essam Sharaf said he favors delaying parliamentary elections to allow
newly established political parties more time to prepare.  The military, which took power after a popular revolt
toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in February, plans to hold
parliamentary elections in September, followed by a presidential
vote this year.  “I see that if we can delay for some time, that this would
give the chance for the political landscape to develop a bit
more,” Sharaf said in an interview conducted by Egyptian
billionaire and politician Naguib Sawiris and streamed on news
 website  masrawy.com. “But as a prime minister I say that if we
decide to go ahead with the dates we have, we will exert all
efforts to make it successful.”  Some political parties, including Sawiris’ Free Egyptians
Party, have called for delaying the elections until security is
improved and a new constitution is written.  The Muslim
Brotherhood ,  Egypt ’s biggest opposition group under Mubarak, has
opposed the proposal.  To contact the reporter for this story:
