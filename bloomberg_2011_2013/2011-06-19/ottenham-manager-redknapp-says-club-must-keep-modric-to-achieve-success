Tottenham coach  Harry Redknapp  said
the club has to keep Croatia midfielder Luka Modric if it wants
to be successful.  Speculation has linked Modric with Chelsea, Manchester City
and  Manchester United . Yesterday, the  Daily Mail reported  that
he wants to leave for Chelsea, which is preparing a second offer
of close to 30 million pounds ($49 million), up from an earlier
bid of 22 million pounds.  Tottenham Chairman Daniel Levy responded that the club
won’t sell Modric “at any price, to Chelsea Football Club or
any other club” and will “not enter into any negotiations
whatsoever, with any club, regarding Luka.”  Levy posted the statement on Tottenham’s website.  “Chelsea are not the only club that have been in for
him,” Redknapp told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Sportsweek program
today. “There have been other clubs -- top, top clubs. But if
Tottenham are looking to go anywhere we can’t be selling Luka.
We have to do something to keep him at the club. We can’t afford
to sell Luka Modric if we want to be a successful club.”  Tottenham was fifth in  England ’s Premier League last
season, missing out on a place in the  Champions League .  To contact the reporter on this story:
