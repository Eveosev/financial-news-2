Europe ’s debt crisis and turmoil in
the  Middle East  threaten Israel’s economy, which hasn’t
“reached a safe haven yet,” Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz
said.  “Europe is a main economic partner, our main trading
partner,” Steinitz said at an economic conference today in
Rishon Lezion. “What is happening in Europe and the U.S. means
that the global crisis isn’t over yet. We are still in the
danger zone.”  European finance ministers were meeting today to hammer out
a new Greek bailout package. European estimates put Greece’s
2012-14 financing gap at as much as 170 billion euros ($243
billion). It would be filled by about 45 billion euros of loans,
plus 57 billion euros in unspent aid from the 2010 bailout,
roughly 30 billion euros in asset-sale proceeds and about 30
billion euros from creditors.  Israel ’s economy expanded an annualized 4.8 percent in the
first quarter, faster than previously estimated, as exports and
investments climbed, the Jerusalem-based  Central Bureau of
Statistics  said on June 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
