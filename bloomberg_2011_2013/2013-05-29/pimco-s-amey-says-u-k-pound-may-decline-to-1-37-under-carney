The pound may drop to a four-year low
of $1.37 during  Mark Carney ’s tenure at the Bank of England,
according to Michael Amey, a money manager at Pacific Investment
Management Co. in London.  The incoming governor, who takes over from  Mervyn King  in
July, will want to see the currency decline, so the “clearest
trade” is to sell the pound, Amey said in an interview today. A
similar move against the euro is unlikely to be achievable
because of the common-currency bloc’s “challenges,” he said.
The pound has dropped 3 percent this year, the third-worst
performer after the yen and the Australian dollar, according to
Bloomberg Correlated-Weighted Indexes.  Sterling can depreciate “on a trade-weighted basis,
probably another 10 to 15 percent,” Amey told reporters at a
media briefing in  London  today. Carney is going to “try and
keep sterling certainly from going up, and probably I think he’s
going to want to see it going lower. I don’t think $1.37 is a
big ask.”  The pound strengthened 0.5 percent to $1.5110 at 2:10 p.m.
London time after falling to $1.5009, the least since March 14.
The U.K. currency has weakened 7 percent against the dollar this
year. It last traded at $1.37 in March 2009.  Sterling was at 85.55 pence per euro, 5.1 percent weaker
from the end of 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
