The Bank of Canada will probably
begin raising interest rates in the second half of 2014 to
contain inflation as the job market tightens, according to the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.  Inflation will rise to 1.7 percent by the end of next year
from 0.9 percent in 2013, the OECD predicted in a report
released today. The unemployment  rate  is forecast to fall to 6.7
percent as the economy nears its potential amid a weaker
currency.  Business investment, stoked by low capital costs and
elevated commodity prices, will combine with exports to boost
economic growth, offsetting weaker consumer and government
spending, though the shift will depend “heavily” on U.S.
growth, the OECD said. Canada’s economy will grow 1.4 percent
this year and 2.3 percent in 2014, the agency said.  Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney makes his last
interest-rate announcement today from a statement due at 10 a.m.
in Ottawa. Stephen Poloz, head of the nation’s export-financing
agency, takes over as governor on June 3.  To contact the reporter on this story:
