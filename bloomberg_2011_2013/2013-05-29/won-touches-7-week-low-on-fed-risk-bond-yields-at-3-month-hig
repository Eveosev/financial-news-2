The won touched a seven-week low and
government bonds fell on speculation the Federal Reserve will
cut debt purchases that have fueled demand for emerging-market
assets. Yields climbed to the highest in more than three months.  The South Korean currency delcined for a second day as Bank
of Korea data today showed the nation’s current-account surplus
narrowed to $3.97 billion in April from a revised $4.93 billion
in March.  Consumer confidence  in the world’s largest economy
climbed to a five-year high and U.S. home prices advanced by the
most since April 2006, according to separate reports yesterday.  “The improvement in U.S. data increased speculation the
Fed will taper its bond-buying program,” said Yoo Hyen Jo, an
analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp. in Seoul. “The won’s drop
may be limited as exporters may repatriate overseas income.”  The wonfell 0.5 percent to 1,132.92 per dollar in Seoul,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency touched
1,133.72, the lowest level since April 11. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of expected moves in the exchange rate
used to price options, climbed 40 basis points, or 0.40
percentage point, to 9.44 percent.  The yield on South  Korea ’s 2.75 percent government bonds
due March 2018 rose 13 basis points to 2.85 percent, prices from
Korea Exchange Inc. show. That’s the highest for a five-year
note since Feb. 14, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of Korea is using monetary and credit policies to
boost corporate spending and support economic growth, central
bank Governor Kim Choong Soo said at a meeting with local
economists in Seoul today.  South Korea will sell $1 billion of debt at near 3 percent,
the Chosun Ilbo newspaper reported today citing unidentified
persons in the government and the financial industry. The timing
and size of the dollar-bond sale hasn’t been decided, Choi Hee
Nam, a finance ministry director general, said by telephone
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
