Bakken crude weakened to the lowest
level this year against U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
with the number of wells and the amount of production in the
North Dakota shale formation at record highs.  Wells drilled in the Bakken grew to 562 from 556 in the
first quarter, according to data from Bloomberg Industries.
Monthly production also set a record in March, increasing 0.5
percent to 718,791 barrels a day, the state Industrial
Commission said May 15.  “What you’re really starting to see is the advent of pad
drilling,” said Christian O’Neill, an energy analyst in  New
York  with Bloomberg Industries. “The companies have more time
within these plays, they’re getting more and more efficient and
their recovery rates are also steadily rising.”  Bakken fell $1 a barrel to $6 below WTI at 2:05 p.m. New
York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level since Nov. 16.  Sweet oils produced in the  Gulf Coast  weakened against WTI
and sour oils strengthened. Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium
shrank by 5 cents a barrel to a premium of $8.25. Light
Louisiana Sweet lost 15 cents a barrel to an $8.70 premium.  Southern Green Canyon gained 50 cents a barrel to a $2.50
premium. Poseidon’s premium rose 15 cents to $3.85. Mars Blend
strengthened 35 cents to a premium of $4.25.  Thunder Horse ’s
premium increased 10 cents to $6.60.  To contact the reporter on this story:
