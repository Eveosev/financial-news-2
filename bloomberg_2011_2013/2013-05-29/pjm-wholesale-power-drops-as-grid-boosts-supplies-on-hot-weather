Spot wholesale electricity in PJM
Interconnection LLC fell for the third time in four days as the
grid operator boosted supplies in anticipation of hotter
weather.  Power at the Western hub dropped 40 percent as the manager
of the grid stretching from New Jersey into North Carolina and
 Illinois  increased scheduled power supplies in its region by 7.5
percent from yesterday. The high temperature in  Washington  today
will be 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32 Celsius), 11 above normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  On-peak power  at the hub, which includes prices from Erie,
Pennsylvania, to Washington, fell $22.85 to $34.55 a megawatt-hour at 12:19 p.m. New York time from yesterday’s full-day
average, PJM data show. On-peak hours run from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.  Electricity usage  across the 13-state grid will climb to
120,765 megawatts from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m., 23 percent higher than
 yesterday’s peak  of 98,837 megawatts at 5:20 p.m.  PJM increased scheduled supplies on its grid to 139,837
megawatts from 130,124 megawatts, according to its daily
 operations data .  Prices on PJM, the largest U.S. grid, which serves more
than 60 million people, jumped late yesterday after a nuclear
power plant went offline.  Dominion Resources Inc. (D)  manually shut the 973-megawatt
North Anna 2 reactor in  Virginia  because of decreasing steam
generator levels at 3:07 p.m., according to a Nuclear Regulatory
Commission  filing . The unit, about 40 miles (64 kilometers)
northwest of Richmond, had been operating at 98 percent of
capacity earlier in the day.  The hourly average at the Western hub surged to $139.95 for
the hour ended at 4 p.m., PJM data showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
