Newlyweds Hugh Hefner and Crystal Harris may need to set a price limit for exchanging gifts. Shortly after Harris  made her husband a homemade gift  for his 87th birthday, the  Playboy  magazine founder dropped $4.995 million on a Hollywood Hills mansion for the 27-year-old Playmate. The couple finally tied the knot in January. They’d been engaged for a while, but Harris called off the wedding in 2011. Now the newlyweds have sealed the deal with their first real estate purchase. According to TMZ , Harris is a co-owner of the property. The modern manse is constructed in a decidedly different style than the traditional and Tudor-esque architecture of the Playboy Mansion. The 5,917-square-foot home was built in 2011 with several modern amenities, as well as a view of the city lights. A gated entrance leads into a contemporary kitchen and up a floating wood staircase into a luxurious master bedroom and bath. Outside, a white-glass infinity pool and deck provide secluded relaxation while sliding doors out front provide open-air living space. Hefner has lived in the famous Playboy Mansion for several years, but it may come as a surprise that the millionare doesn’t own it. According to details of the lease, filed with the SEC as an appendix to his employment agreement, Hefner pays rent for the 29-room house. With the Playboy Bunny House (across the street from Hefner’s not-so-humble abode)  recently listed for $11 million , time will tell whether Hefner decides to make the Hollywood Hills home his primary residence.
