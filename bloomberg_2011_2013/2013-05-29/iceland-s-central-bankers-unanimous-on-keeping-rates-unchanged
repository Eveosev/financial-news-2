Members of the Iceland central bank’s
policy board were unanimous on keeping Sedlabanki’s benchmark
interest rate unchanged at its May 10 and 14 meetings.  “The board was of the opinion that the current interest
rate level provided sufficient restraint and that the monetary
stance could be assumed to tighten with declining inflation”
according to the minutes published today.  Central bank Governor Mar Gudmundsson “proposed that rates
be held unchanged” and all five board members “voted in favor
of the proposal,” the minutes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
