The Marquis de Sade complained about
his mother-in-law and the state of his finances in a 1776 letter
to his lawyer a few months before his arrest for nonstop
debauchery.  The four-page missive, with an estimated range of $4,000 to
$6,000, is part of a 247-lot sale being conducted tomorrow by
the auctioneer Profiles in History. (His mother-in-law’s intense
loathing and great political connections eventually landed him
in the Bastille.)  Letters written by Mohandas Gandhi,  George Washington ,
 Marilyn Monroe  and others could tally as much as $5 million. The
sale, titled “The Property of a Distinguished American Private
Collector, Part II” will take place in  Westlake Village,
California , and  online . It’s the  second  in a series of sales
dealing with a collection totaling 3,000 manuscripts.  “Their first sale had excellent American political and
military history,” said  Seth Kaller , a private  art dealer  in
historic documents. “This sale has some of that, but its focus
is really a much wider tribute to genius across many fields.
It’s really an amazing assemblage.”  The top item by estimate is Thomas Edison’s handwritten
laboratory notebook, which could fetch $80,000 to $120,000. With
121 pages and 8 sketches, it contains logs of Edison’s 1927-28
experiments to find alternative organic sources for the
production of rubber for car tires.  Eight drawings that were part of Edison’s original patent
application for a light bulb are estimated at $20,000 to
$30,000.  Einstein, Wittgenstein  Another highlight is an archive of 56 signed letters
written by nine 20th-century scientists, including seven Nobel
Prize winners, to German physicist and philosopher Moritz
Schlick.  The group, which is expected to bring $60,000 to $80,000,
includes five signed letters by  Albert Einstein  and nine
autographed letters by philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein.  Monroe’s desperate letter to her mentor Lee Strasberg is
expected to bring $30,000 to $50,000. The two-page dispatch is
written on stationery from Hollywood’s Hotel Bel-Air.  “I am still lost -- I mean I can’t get myself together,”
the actress wrote. “I sound crazy but I think I’m going crazy
... It’s just that I get before a camera and my concentration
and everything I’m trying to learn leaves me. Then I feel like
I’m not existing in the human race at all.”  Gandhi’s Biscuits  Charles Darwin ’s signed four-page letter discussing a new
French edition of “The Origin of Species” expresses his
ambition “to influence the judgment of the naturalists of that
country.” It is estimated at $10,000 to $15,000.  Gandhi’s 1930 letter to a friend that mentions a revolution
-- along with biscuits and fruit experiments -- has an estimate
of $4,000 to $6,000.  A short missive by Ludwig van Beethoven is estimated at
$40,000 to $60,000. It was written in 1805, shortly before the
premiere of “Fidelio,” the composer’s sole opera, and
addressed to Friedrich Sebastian Mayer, the baritone who sang
the part of Don Pizarro in early performances.  Washington ’s signed, three-page letter written on Jan. 10,
1786, from  Mount Vernon  is expected to bring $30,000 to $50,000.
The letter expresses the future president’s hope to hire black
slaves as laborers for the construction of navigable canals
connecting the western territories with the Atlantic states.  John Lennon ’s bitter typed letter to Paul and Linda
McCartney urges the couple to get off their “high horse.”
Unsigned, it features hand-written notes and is estimated at
$30,000 to $50,000.  Muse highlights include  Craig Seligman  on  books ,  Frederik
Balfour  on  art  sales.  To contact the reporters of this story:
