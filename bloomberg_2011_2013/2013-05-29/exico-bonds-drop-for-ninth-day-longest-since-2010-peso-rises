Mexican bonds fell for a ninth day as
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will curtail monetary stimulus
overshadowed optimism that the Latin American nation’s
government will pass legislation to boost growth.  Yields on benchmark securities maturing in December 2024
rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 5.27
percent at 9:04 a.m. in  Mexico  City, the highest on a closing
basis since Jan. 17, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The price dropped 0.66 centavo to 140.97 centavos, extending its
stretch of declines to the longest since November 2010.  “Right now the Fed has more weight,” Roberto Ivan Garcia Castellanos, a bond trader at Casa de Bolsa Finamex SAB in
Guadalajara, Mexico, said in a phone interview. “The change of
the view of the Fed is more significant now than the reforms.”  Yields fell this month to record lows on speculation
President Enrique Pena Nieto would succeed in pushing through
legal changes to open up the state-controlled energy to more
private investment and to boost tax collection.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 12.6243 per  U.S. dollar 
after falling yesterday to 12.6329, the weakest level on a
closing basis since March 7. It has lost 3.9 percent in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
