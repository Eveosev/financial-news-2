Wheat rose for the first time in
three sessions as hot, dry weather in the southern U.S. Great
Plains threatens the winter crop and rain in northern states
delays planting of spring varieties. Corn jumped. Soy fell.  Parts of Kansas, Colorado and Texas that are already dry
will get little rain this week, DTN in Omaha,  Nebraska , said in
a report. Spring wheat was 79 percent planted as of May 26,
below the five-year average of 86 percent, government data show.
Four inches (10 centimeters) of rain are expected in areas of
Minnesota and  North Dakota  in the next five days, Commodity
Weather Group LLC in Bethesda, Maryland, said.  “It’s not surprising to see wheat rally” because of the
weather,  Jason Britt , the president of Central States
Commodities Inc., a brokerage in  Kansas City ,  Missouri , said in
a telephone interview.  Wheat futures for July delivery rose 1.3 percent to settle
at $7.0275 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade.
The price dropped 1.4 percent in the previous two sessions. The
grain has declined 9.7 percent this year as the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  forecast that world production will rise to a
record in the 12 months that start June 1.  Corn futures for December delivery added 2.7 percent to
$5.6575 a bushel in Chicago on speculation that delayed planting
will curb U.S. production that’s expected to surge to a record
in the year that starts on Sept. 1. The price has plunged 19
percent in 2013.  “The planting delays are real and have to be watched,”
Britt said. “There’s some flooding and the crops don’t look so
good.”  Soybean futures for July delivery fell 0.5 percent to
$15.0175 a bushel on the CBOT. The oilseed has gained 6.5
percent this year. Today, the USDA reported the cancellation of
147,000 metric tons of export sales to  China .  In the U.S., corn is the biggest crop, followed by
soybeans, hay and wheat, USDA data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
