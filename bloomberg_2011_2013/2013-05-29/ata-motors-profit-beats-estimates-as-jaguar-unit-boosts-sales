Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , India’s biggest
automaker, posted profit that beat analyst estimates as
increased sales at its Jaguar Land Rover Ltd. luxury unit offset
losses at home.  Fourth-quarter  net income  fell 37 percent to 39.5 billion
rupees ($704 million), the Mumbai-based company said. That beat
the 26.7 billion-rupee median of 41  analysts’ estimates  compiled
by Bloomberg. Profit at the luxury unit was 378 million pounds
($572 million), surpassing the 365 million-pound median estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  Deliveries at the luxury unit, which Tata Motors bought
from Ford Motor Co. in 2008, increased 19 percent to 116,340
vehicles in the three months ended March 31. In comparison,
sales at the local business plummeted 29 percent to 184,942
units, as customers in  India  held off purchases on expensive
loans and slowing economic growth.  “As far as Jaguar Land Rover is concerned, they are going
to gain from a depreciation in the pound,” Umesh Karne, an
analyst at Brics Securities Ltd. in Mumbai, said before the
results announcement. “Raw material prices are softening and
the margins at JLR will improve as models such as the new Range
Rover and F-Type improve the model mix.”  Tata Motors rose as much as 5 percent, and changed hands at
312.20 rupees, or 2.8 percent higher, as of 9:24 a.m. in Mumbai
trading. The shares had dropped 2.8 percent this year as of
yesterday, compared with the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex’s 3.7
percent advance in the same period.  Product Mix  Models such as the Jaguar XF, Land Rover Freelander and the
best-selling Evoque accounted for more than 50 percent of the
luxury unit’s sales in the quarter, according to company data.
These models had an average selling price of about 30,000 pounds
compared with the 42,000-pound average for its other models,
Vijay Somaiya, head of treasury at Tata Motors, said in a
briefing on Jan. 24.  Jaguar accounted for 21,163 units of the luxury unit’s
deliveries last quarter and Land Rover for 95,177 vehicles,
according to company data.  Sales of Jaguar Land Rover rose 22 percent to 5.05 billion
pounds, according to the statement. That beat the 4.72 billion-pound median estimate of eight analysts surveyed.  The luxury unit based in Gaydon,  England  plans to introduce
eight new or refreshed models this year, Jaguar Land Rover Chief
Executive Officer Ralf Speth said yesterday.  F-Type  The automaker began deliveries of its two-seat F-Type
model, that starts from $69,000, this month. Jaguar expects the
U.S. to be the largest market for the model, accounting for
almost half its sales, it said May 9.  The company is also working on a diesel hybrid Range Rover
model, Chief Financial Officer C. Ramakrishnan said yesterday.
The automaker aims to maintain the luxury unit’s earnings margin
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization at 14
percent to 15 percent, he said.  Net  sales  at Tata Motors, including units, increased 10
percent to 558.4 billion rupees in the three months ended March,
according to the statement. That surpassed the 518 billion-rupee
median of 39 analysts’ estimates.  “Strong demand, growth in volumes, favorable market mix
and favorable operating foreign exchange at Jaguar Land Rover”
offset the standalone business’s performance, Tata Motors said
in the statement. Foreign exchange gains amounted to 837.1
million rupees in the quarter, compared with 61.8 million rupees
a year earlier.  Emerging Markets  Jaguar Land Rover is turning to  emerging markets  such as
 China ,  Russia  and  South Africa  to pursue growth. Global retail
sales in the year ended March 31 rose 23 percent to 374,669
vehicles, with those in China surging 73 percent to 77,075
units, according to company data. China was the company’s
largest market, it said in January.  “I expect China to continue to grow,” Speth said
yesterday. “The new government will find ways to boost the
economic growth and the automotive market will come up, and I
expect the luxury car market to grow faster.”  The luxury unit, together with Chery Automobile Co., is
investing 10.9 billion  yuan  ($1.78 billion) to build a
manufacturing plant in eastern China. The venture will include a
local brand as well as a research & development center and an
engine plant.  Jaguar Land Rover is also studying the feasibility for a
plant in  Saudi Arabia , it said in December. The luxury unit said
last year it is expanding Jaguar Land Rover assembly at the
company’s factory in Pune, located in the western state of
Maharashtra in India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
