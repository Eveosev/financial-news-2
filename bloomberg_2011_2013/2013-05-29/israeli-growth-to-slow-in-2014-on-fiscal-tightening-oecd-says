Israeli economic growth will probably
slow next year as fiscal tightening offsets the positive effects
of a pick-up in export markets, the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development said.  Growth will probably to slow to 3.4 percent in 2014 from
3.9 percent this year, the organization said. Excluding natural
gas production, output will slow to 2.7 percent from 2.9
percent, the OECD said.  “External demand will underpin activity in 2014, but the
contractionary effects of a sharp fiscal consolidation will be
substantial,” the Paris-based OECD said in its World Economic
Outlook report today.  The OECD forecast an upswing in 2014 in the economies of
the U.S. and European Union,  Israel ’s top two export markets,
and sees world trade growing 5.8 percent from 3.6 percent this
year.  Exports may also benefit from the cumulative cut of 50
basis points in Israel’s benchmark lending rate this month,
designed to narrow the gap with rates in major economies and
prevent a strong shekel from compromising export-led growth.
Exports make up about 40 percent of Israel’s economy, and a
stronger shekel makes them more expensive to buy.  Narrowing Deficit  While the central bank is cutting borrowing costs, the
government is paring planned spending and raising taxes to rein
in the  budget deficit .  “Remaining within the spending ceiling must be a priority
alongside the implementation of revenue measures to keep the
deficit on track.” the report said.  Looking ahead, the central bank may need to change
direction in its monetary policy as early as next year, the OECD
said.  “A tightening monetary stance, probably beginning in the
second half of 2014, may be required to prevent inflationary
pressures from taking hold,” it said.  The  unemployment rate  may rise to 7.2 percent in 2013 from
6.9 percent last year, according to the report. The rate may
then drop to 6.8 percent in 2014, the OECD said.
