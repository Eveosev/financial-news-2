UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s largest bank,
cut four analyst positions from its Canadian business as it
seeks to curb costs, according to a person with direct knowledge
of the decision.  Peter Rozenberg, a financial analyst, and associate Asim
Imran in Toronto left the Zurich-based bank yesterday, as did
Matt Donohue and George Toriola, energy analysts in Calgary,
according to the person, who requested anonymity because the
cuts haven’t been made public.  Rozenberg, Donohue, Toriola and Imran didn’t respond to e-mails seeking comment. Phone calls to their bank extensions
weren’t answered.  Megan Stinson, a New York-based spokeswoman for UBS,
declined to comment on the job cuts. UBS has about 200 employees
in  Canada , she said.  The bank’s Canadian unit trimmed 20 investment-banking jobs
in January. UBS said in October 2012 that it plans to eliminate
10,000 positions worldwide over three years and dismantle
portions of the investment bank to increase profitability.  To contact the reporter on this story:
