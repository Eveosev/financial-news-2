A gauge of U.S. corporate credit risk
reached the highest level in four weeks amid increased
speculation the economy is improving enough for the  Federal
Reserve  to scale back stimulus measures.  The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade Index, a
credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to hedge
against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness, increased
0.3 basis point to a mid-price of 76.2 basis points at 8:34 a.m.
in New York, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure earlier rose to as high as 77.8, the highest intraday
level since May 2.  Signs that the economy is firming are stoking concern that
the Fed will trim its $85 billion in monthly debt purchases,
which have suppressed  interest rates  and pushed investors into
riskier, higher-yielding assets such as corporate bonds. The
Conference Boardâ€™s index of consumer sentiment yesterday climbed
to the highest level in more than five years while a measure of
property values had the biggest 12-month gain since April 2006.  The credit-swaps index typically rises as investor
confidence deteriorates and falls as it improves. The contracts
pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails to meet its
obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A basis point
equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10 million of
debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
