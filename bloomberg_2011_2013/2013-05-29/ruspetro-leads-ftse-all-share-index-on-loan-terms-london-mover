RusPetro Plc (RPO) , an oil producer in
Siberia, rose as much as 16 percent to lead gains among the 600
companies on the  FTSE All-Share Index (ASX)  after OAO  Sberbank (SBRCY)  granted
it a loan extension and a “holiday” on interest payments.  The  stock  jumped to as much as 45 pence and was up 14
percent at 44.25 pence at 10:43 a.m. in London, the biggest gain
in a month. More than 2 million shares had traded, about 60
percent above the three-month daily average for the Moscow-based
oil and gas explorer.  State-run Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, extended
RusPetro’s $297.4 million loan by three years to April 2018, and
agreed to waive interest payments this year, as well as in 2014
as long as the driller meets certain covenants, the company said
today in a statement.  The deal allows RusPetro to “fully focus on monetizing our
gas reserves and developing our oil business,” Chief Financial
Officer  Tom Reed  said in the statement.  Over two years, the waiver represents a $50 million
reduction in payments by RusPetro, which holds three exploration
and production licenses in Western Siberia. The restructuring
cost is $1 million, the company said. The effective interest
rate is 8 percent, payable semi-annually starting in 2015.  To contact the reporter on this story:
