Vedanta Resources Plc (VED) , the oil and
metals producer controlled by billionaire  Anil Agarwal , hired
six banks to arrange a $1.2 billion loan to refinance debt used
to buy  Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , according to two people familiar with
the matter.  The London-based company hired  Bank of America Corp ,
 Barclays Plc (BARC) ,  Citigroup Inc. (C) ,  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ,  Royal Bank
of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  and Standard Chartered Plc to arrange the
five-year, dollar-denominated loan, the people said, asking not
to be identified because the terms aren’t set.  Vedanta spokesman Senjam Raj Sekhar said via e-mail the
company will respond to queries shortly.  Vedanta bought Cairn India from Edinburgh, Scotland-based
 Cairn Energy Plc (CNE)  and other investors for $8.67 billion in
December 2011. That deal helped Vedanta diversify into energy
and tap Indian demand, which the U.S. Energy Information
Administration estimates will grow 14 percent in the five years
to 2015.  India ’s top court cleared the acquisition May 9.  The company has $16.3 billion of  loans and bonds 
outstanding, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
