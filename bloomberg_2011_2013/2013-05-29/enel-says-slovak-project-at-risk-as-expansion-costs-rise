Enel SpA (ENEL) ’s nuclear power plant
expansion in Slovakia is at risk unless the east European
country’s government “quickly” approves a plan to increase
financing for the project, the company’s Slovak unit said.  Works at two additional reactors at the Mochovce site
operated by Enel’s Slovenske Elektrarne AS may be halted unless
its owners agree to boost spending by 800 million euros ($1.03
billion), Jana Burdova, a spokeswoman for the company, in which
Enel has 66 percent, said in an e-mailed statement today. The
project’s “complexity and a need to meet the latest safety
standards” boosted building costs.  The Slovak government, which holds the remaining stake in
the utility, didn’t back higher spending plans at a shareholder
meeting yesterday as it needs more information on the project,
Economy Ministry spokesman Stanislav Jurikovic said by phone
today.  Slovenske, based in the Slovak capital of Bratislava, has
allotted 3 billion euros for the project, which is expected to
be completed in 2015, making it the largest private investment
in the country. The upgrade is part of Enel’s plan to boost
generation capacity in the country, which is seeking to regain
self-sufficiency in power production following the shutdown of
Soviet-era reactors.  Italy’s Enel bought a majority stake in Slovenske from the
Slovak government in 2004. The utility, whose net income rose 22
percent to 457 million euros in 2011, has stopped paying
dividends to finance the expansion of the Mochovce site, where
two reactors have been operational since late 1990s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
