Bookings of the largest oil tankers
are set to take place at rates 20 percent above current market
levels as stronger demand in the Persian Gulf curbs supply of
the ships, according to Arctic Securities ASA.  Charter rates for very large crude carriers hauling Saudi
Arabian oil to  Japan  are poised to touch 50 industry-standard
Worldscale points, Oslo-based analyst Erik Nikolai Stavseth said
in an e-mailed report today. Hire costs for VLCCs on the route
as assessed by the Baltic Exchange in London jumped to 41.81
points yesterday, leaving them up 16 percent in three sessions.  The supply of VLCCs available over the next four weeks in
the gulf, the world’s biggest crude-loading region, increased by
three to 56, figures from Marex Spectron Group showed today. The
tally shrank to 53 vessels on May 27, the lowest since November,
according to the company’s data. Each of the tankers can hold 2
million barrels of oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
