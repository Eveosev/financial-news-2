Treasuries fell, and bonds around the
world headed for their steepest monthly loss in almost a decade,
on concern the  Federal Reserve  will trim its debt purchases in
the months ahead.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.3 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004. U.S. Treasuries, benchmarks
for company and sovereign borrowing costs globally, dropped 1.9
percent, the Bank of America indexes show. The U.S. 10-year
yield climbed to a 13-month high.  “There’s more selling left,” said Tomohisa Fujiki, an
interest-rate strategist in Tokyo at BNP Paribas SA, whose  New
York  unit is one of the 21 primary dealers that underwrite  U.S.
debt . “We can’t rule out another move” toward higher yields,
he said.  U.S 10-year  rates  increased five basis points to 2.21
percent as of 6:38 a.m. in  London , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The price of the 1.75 percent note due in May 2023
slid 13/32, or $4.06 per $1,000 face amount, to 95 7/8. The
yield earlier reached 2.23 percent, the highest since April
2012.  The U.S. is scheduled to sell $35 billion of five-year
notes today. A two-year auction for the same amount yesterday
drew the fewest  bids  since February 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
