The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development cut its economic forecast for  Italy 
for the second time this month as weak household demand extends
the longest recession in more than two decades.  Italy’s gross domestic product will contract 1.8 percent
this year before rising 0.4 percent in 2014, the Paris-based
 OECD  said today in its Global Economic Outlook. That compares
with a 1.5 percent decline for 2013 and growth of 0.5 percent in
2014 forecast in a May 2 survey on Italy, which revised its
November predictions.  The country’s recession “will continue throughout 2013 as
the effects of fiscal tightening and restrictive conditions bear
down on economic activity,” the OECD said in today’s report.
“Employment and hours worked will continue to fall,
constraining household budget and consumption spending.”  Italy slipped into  recession  in the final quarter of 2011.
The austerity policies of former Prime Minister Mario Monti,
which helped bring the budget deficit within the European Union
limit, deepened the slump in the EU’s third-biggest economy and
pushed the jobless rate to the highest in almost 20 years.  “With employment likely to decline in 2013-14 and with the
household saving rate having fallen significantly over the past
few years, not much growth in consumer demand can be expected,”
the OECD said today.  Household Demand  The group also revised its forecast for household
consumption in 2013 to a decline of 2.2 percent from the 2
percent contraction projected earlier this month.  The OECD revised forecasts are also more pessimistic than
projections by the Italian government and the European
Commission. On April 11 the Rome-based Treasury forecast the
euro region’s third-biggest economy would contract 1.3 percent
this year before expanding by the same rate next. The Brussels-based executive arm of the European Union estimated on May 3
that Italy’s GDP will fall 1.3 percent in 2013 and rise 0.7
percent in 2014.  The OECD also predicted that Italy’s  jobless rate  will rise
to 11.9 percent this year and 12.5 percent next year.
Unemployment in March was 11.5 percent with youth joblessness at
more than three times that level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
