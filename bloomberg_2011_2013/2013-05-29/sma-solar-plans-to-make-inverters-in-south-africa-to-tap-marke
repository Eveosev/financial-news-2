SMA Solar Technology AG (S92) ,  Germany ’s
biggest solar-energy company by market value, plans to make
products in South Africa as it targets growth there.  SMA, the biggest maker of inverters that convert power from
solar panels for use on the grid, seeks to set up a factory in
South Africa to meet local-content requirements and tap into the
country’s growing energy market, the Niestetal-based company
said today in a statement.  “South Africa has strategic importance for SMA,” Chief
Executive Officer Pierre-Pascal Urbon said. “The country has
good economic growth with a corresponding increase in energy
demand.”  While SMA said preparations for the South African plant are
under way, it didn’t say how much capacity it would have or when
it would be operational. Calls to the company’s press department
weren’t answered, and an investor relations spokesman declined
to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
