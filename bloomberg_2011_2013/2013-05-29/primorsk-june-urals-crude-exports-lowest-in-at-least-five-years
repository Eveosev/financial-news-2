Russia , the worldâ€™s largest energy
exporter, plans to ship less than 1 million barrels a day of
Urals crude from Primorsk port on the Baltic Sea for the first
time in about five years, a final loading program showed.  Primorsk will ship 39 cargoes in June totaling 3.9 million
metric tons, or 953,000 barrels a day, down 16 percent from this
month, the schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed. The port
has  loaded  more than 1 million barrels a day every month since
at least March 2008, when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  Ust-Luga, also on the Baltic, will ship 19 cargoes of
100,000 tons each, according to the program. That amounts to
464,000 barrels a day, 6.5 percent less than planned this month.  Primorsk has three unassigned slots and Ust-Luga has two
positions available, according to the program. The volumes and
number of unassigned positions are the same as in a preliminary
program obtained May 24. Each slot is for 100,000 tons.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea will be 3.163
million tons next month. That includes about 753,000 barrels a
day of Urals, up 13 percent from May, and 20,000 barrels a day
of Siberian Light grade. There is one unassigned Urals cargo of
80,000 tons at the port.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
