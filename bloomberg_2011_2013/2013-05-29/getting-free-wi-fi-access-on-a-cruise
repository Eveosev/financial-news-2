Internet access on cruise ships can be expensive—often $1 per minute—and excruciatingly slow. So when ships pull into port, passengers often go in search of cheap or free Wi-Fi. Because it's not always easy to suss out in advance where in port the Wi-Fi will be, I thought it would help to share the story of how I found free Wi-Fi in Aruba last week. I watched for crew members leaving the ship carrying laptops and followed them. They ended up in the  Renaissance Mall  at a Starbucks just below the lobby of the  Renaissance Aruba Resort & Casino . The free Wi-Fi extended beyond the Starbucks to the hotel's open-air lobby, bar, and pool. More free Wi-Fi could be found across the street at Renaissance Marketplace, a set of shops with plenty of outdoor seating with a harbor view. There was Wi-Fi inside the cruise terminal building too—a convenience that is not the norm for most cruise piers—but it cost $5 an hour. Since I had to spend the whole day on my laptop, and I liked the idea of drinks with a view, I opted for the Renaissance complex. When you’re headed on a cruise and you'll need Internet access, do your homework and research in advance where there’s convenient Wi-Fi, either free or affordable, in each port on your itinerary. Although it's normally good source for sussing out Wi-Fi spots,  JiWire’s global Wi-Fi finder  is often not so good for Wi-Fi options near cruise piers.  Cruise Critic’s Ports of Call boards  sometimes have this information. When all else fails, in the Caribbean the local  Margaritaville  usually has free Wi-Fi and plenty of electrical outlets.
