China ’s aviation regulator lifted a
six-year ban on independently owned airlines, the Wall Street
Journal reported, without saying where it got the information.  The Civil Aviation Administration of China this month
allowed a group led by Shandong province-based Nanshan Group to
set up Qingdao Airlines, the newspaper said. Nanshan holds 55
percent of the carrier, Qingdao Transportation Development Group
25 percent and  Air China Ltd. (601111)  unit Shandong Airlines Co. 20
percent, it said.  That followed the regulator’s decision two weeks earlier to
allow Yunnan Jing Cheng Group to establish Ruili Airlines in
western China, the WSJ reported.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
