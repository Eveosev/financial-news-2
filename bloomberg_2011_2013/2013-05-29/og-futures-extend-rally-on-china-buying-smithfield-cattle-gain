Hog futures rose, extending a rally
to a 10-month high, on speculation that demand will rise after
 China ’s biggest pork producer agreed to acquire Smithfield Foods
Inc., the largest U.S. processor. Cattle also gained.  Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. said today it agreed
to acquire the Smithfield, Virginia-based company for $4.72
billion to boost meat supplies for China, the world’s largest
pork-consuming nation and the third-largest buyer of U.S.
supplies. Wholesale-pork  prices  in the U.S. are up 19 percent in
the past year, government data show, and hog futures have gained
6.9 percent.  “The market has a psychological positive today to work
with, with the announcement the Chinese are interested in our
pork,” Lawrence Kane, a senior market adviser at Stewart-Peterson Group in  Yates City ,  Illinois , said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for August settlement rose 0.4 percent to
93.725 cents a pound at 10:57 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after reaching 94.1 cents, the highest for a most-active contract since July 9.  Japan and  Mexico  are the largest buyers of U.S. pork.  Cattle futures for August delivery rose 0.5 percent to
$1.20025 a pound on the CME. Prices are down 9.3 percent this
year. Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.3
percent to $1.45925 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
