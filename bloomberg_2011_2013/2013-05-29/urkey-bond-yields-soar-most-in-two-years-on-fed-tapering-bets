Turkey ’s bond  yields  surged the most
since October 2008 as investor speculation of a tapering in U.S.
economic stimulus measures damped appetite for riskier assets.
The lira headed for its lowest level to the dollar in a year.  Yields on two-year benchmark notes climbed 26 basis points,
or 0.26 percentage point, to 5.52 percent at the close in
Istanbul, the highest level in more than a month. The lira
depreciated 0.3 percent to 1.8636 per dollar, the lowest level
on a closing basis since May 31, 2012.  Investors stepped up bets on reduced Federal Reserve easing
after U.S.  consumer confidence  climbed to the highest level in
more than five years, according to a Conference Board report
released yesterday. Turkey is among the “large emerging-market
current-account deficit economies” being hit harder by the
selloff as investors look for “quality rather than yield,”
 Bhanu Baweja  and  Manik Narain , analysts at UBS AG, wrote in a
research note today.  “Turkish bonds are following 10-year U.S. Treasuries,”
Baris Buyukdemir, general manager at Ceros Securities in
Istanbul, said in a phone interview. “The climb here won’t end
unless the gain in 10-year yields ends over there.”  The yield on benchmark 10-year U.S. debt surged 16 basis
points to 2.17 percent yesterday.  The lira has lost 4.3 percent this year, with analysts
forecasting a drop to 1.90 per dollar by the end of the year,
according to forward rates data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank in Ankara cut its benchmark one-week borrowing rate
by a larger-than-expected 50 basis points to 4.5 percent on May
16.  Lira Weakness  “The lira’s depreciation supports exports while helping
limit imports,” Buyukdemir said. “This is something the
central bank wants, due to concern that the current-account
deficit could widen.”  The MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index slumped 0.7 percent to
1,023.48, headed for the lowest level since April 26. The  Borsa
Istanbul National 100 (XU100)  index fell 2.9 percent to 87,346.01,
retreating for a fifth day in its longest losing streak since
July 23.  “This is almost full-blown risk aversion we are going
through in global emerging markets,”  Benoit Anne , head of
emerging-market strategy at Societe Generale SA in London, said
in an e-mailed note to investors. “The general market momentum
is clearly not working in favor of global emerging market risky
assets.”  If U.S. 10-year yields approach 2.5 percent over the course
of the year from their current level of 2.14 percent, Turkish
benchmark yields could climb to about 6 percent, Ceros’s
Buyukdemir said.  The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a
month to support the  U.S. economy . Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
on May 22 the central bank may cut the pace of buying “in the
next few meetings” if economic conditions show a sustained
improvement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
