U.K. government bonds declined,
sending the 10-year gilt yield above 2 percent for the first
time since March, even as an industry report showed retail sales
fell the most in 16 months in May.  Sterling rose from an 11-week low versus the dollar. Two-year gilt yields climbed to highest since January as the Debt
Management Office sold 1.75 billion pounds ($2.65 billion) of
securities due in 2015 in a so-called mini-tender. U.K. bonds
failed to keep pace with losses on Treasuries, with the  yield
difference  between 10-year debt widening to the most since
September 2006 amid speculation the Federal Reserve will taper
its stimulus sooner than the Bank of England.  “While gilts are outperforming Treasuries because of
speculation that the Fed will sooner rather than later fade out
its stimulus, bond yields in core markets are being driven
higher by the perception that the Fed will lead the way and
other central banks will probably follow,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Any data that shows improvement in the
U.K.’s fragile economy will underpin yields.”  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields rose four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 2 percent at 4:24 p.m. London time,
after rising to 2.03 percent, the highest since March 11. The
1.75 percent security slid 0.3, or 3 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 97.905.  The yield on two-year gilts added one basis point to 0.38
percent after reaching 0.4 percent, the  highest  since Jan. 23.  Sales Decline  A gauge of annual sales growth in the U.K. dropped to minus
11, the lowest since January 2012, from minus 1 in April, the
Confederation of British Industry said. Economists had forecast
an increase to 3, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  The U.K. sold 4.75 percent gilts maturing in September 2015
at an average yield of 0.375 percent, up from 0.304 percent at a
previous auction of the same securities on Oct. 30.  The yield spread between Treasury 10-year notes and
similar-maturity  gilts  narrowed by six basis points to 15 basis
points after widening to 21 basis points, the most since
September 2006. The Treasury 10-year yield fell two basis points
to 2.15 percent after climbing 16 basis points yesterday, the
biggest increase since October 2011.  Government bonds around the world are headed for their
steepest monthly loss in almost a decade as signs the U.S.
economy is recovering hardened speculation the Fed will trim its
debt purchases.  Steepest Loss  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.3 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004.  Gilts lost 2.1 percent this month through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bonds dropped
1.4 percent and U.S. Treasuries declined 2.1 percent.  The pound may weaken to a four-year low of $1.37 during
Mark Carney’s tenure at the Bank of England, according to
Michael Amey, a London-based money manager at Pacific Investment
Management Co.  The incoming governor, who takes over from Mervyn King in
July, will want to see the currency decline, so the “clearest
trade” is to sell the pound, Amey said in an interview today.  Sterling can depreciate “on a trade-weighted basis,
probably another 10 to 15 percent,” Amey told reporters at a
media briefing in  London  today. “I don’t think $1.37 is a big
ask.” The U.K. currency last traded at that level in March
2009.  The pound rose 0.4 percent to $1.5106 after falling to
$1.5009, the least since March 14. The U.K. currency weakened
0.2 percent to 85.66 pence per euro.  Sterling has dropped 3 percent this year, the third-worst
performer after the yen and Australian dollar among 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The U.S. currency gained 5.1 percent and the
euro strengthened2.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
