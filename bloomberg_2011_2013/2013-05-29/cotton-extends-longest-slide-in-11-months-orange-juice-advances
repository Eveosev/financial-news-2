Cotton fell, extending the longest
slump since June, on speculation that slowing growth in  China 
will curb demand. Orange juice, cocoa and coffee rose. Sugar
dropped.  The  International Monetary Fund  lowered its forecasts for
growth in China, the world’s biggest user of the fiber, to about
7.75 percent this year and next. In April, the IMF projected
growth of 8 percent this year and 8.2 percent in 2014. Through
May 26, 59 percent of the U.S. cotton crop was planted, up from
39 percent a week earlier, the government said in a report
yesterday. Sowing is about 17 percentage points behind last
year.  “People are thinking we’re going to get this crop off to a
reasonably decent start after this horrible start we got off to
earlier in the year,”  Jack Scoville , a vice president at Price
Futures Group in Chicago, said in a telephone interview. “We’ve
got some demand questions,” he said, citing China.  Cotton for July delivery fell 0.5 percent to 80.99 cents a
