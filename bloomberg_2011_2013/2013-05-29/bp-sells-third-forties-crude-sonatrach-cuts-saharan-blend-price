BP Plc (BP/)  sold its third North Sea
Forties crude cargo for June loading at a lower price than the
previous trade. No bids or offers were made for Russian Urals.  Algeria ’s Sonatrach Group reduced its official selling
price for benchmark Saharan Blend crude for June shipments to 85
cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to an e-mailed
price list from the company. This compares with a premium of 30
cents for May.  North Sea  BP sold Forties for June 8 to June 10 to  Royal Dutch Shell
Plc (RDSA)  at 30 cents a barrel less than Dated Brent, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window. That compares with its trade yesterday at a
discount of 10 cents.  Trafigura Beheer BV failed to sell Forties for June 15 to
June 17 at 30 cents a barrel less than the cash cost of North
Sea crude for August, according to the survey.  Statoil ASA (STL)  was unable to buy Oseberg for June 16 to June
18 at 85 cents a barrel more than Dated Brent, while Total SA
didn’t manage to buy the grade for June 21 to June 23 at the
same premium, the survey showed.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days rose by 15 cents to a discount of 6 cents a barrel
to Dated Brent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for July settlement traded at $102.90 a barrel on the
ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window, compared
with $104.29 yesterday. The August contract was at $102.68 at
the same time today, a discount of 22 cents to July.  Mediterranean/Urals  Urals in the Mediterranean rose by 2 cents to a discount of
15 cents a barrel to Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. In northwest Europe, the  discount  was at 14 cents a
barrel to the benchmark, compared with minus 25 cents yesterday.  Socar Trading SA sold 600,000 barrels of Azeri Light for
June 8 to June 12 to Total at $1.70 a barrel more than Dated
Brent, the survey showed.  OAO Surgutneftegas sold 100,000 metric tons each of Baltic
Urals to Total and Shell via a tender, according to two people
with knowledge of matter who asked not to be identified because
the information is confidential.  Total was awarded the shipment for June 19 to June 20
loading from Ust-Luga while Shell got a June 22 to June 23 cargo
from Primorsk, they said.  Russia plans to ship less than 1 million barrels a day of
Urals from Primorsk for the first time in about five years, a
final loading program showed.  Primorsk will ship 39 cargoes in June totaling 3.9 million
tons, or 953,000 barrels a day, down 16 percent from this month,
the schedule obtained by Bloomberg News showed. The port has
loaded more than 1 million barrels a day every month since at
least March 2008, when Bloomberg began tracking the data.  Ust-Luga will ship 19 cargoes of 100,000 tons each,
according to the program. That amounts to 464,000 barrels a day,
6.5 percent less than planned this month.  Primorsk has three unassigned slots and Ust-Luga has two
positions available, according to the program. The volumes and
number of unassigned positions are the same as in a preliminary
program obtained May 24. Each slot is for 100,000 tons.  Exports from Novorossiysk on the Black Sea will be 3.163
million tons next month. That includes about 753,000 barrels a
day of Urals, up 13 percent from May, and 20,000 barrels a day
of Siberian Light grade. There is one unassigned Urals cargo of
80,000 tons at the port.  West Africa  Benchmark Nigerian Qua Iboe blend fell by 5 cents to $2.25
a barrel more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. That’s the least since Feb. 22.  PT Pertamina,  Indonesia ’s state-owned oil company, is
seeking to buy as much as 4.4 million barrels of low-sulfur
crude for August delivery to its Balikpapan and Cilacap
refineries, a tender document obtained by Bloomberg News showed.
The tender closes tomorrow, with one-day validity.  Nigeria raised exports of Akpo crude for June to six
cargoes of 1 million barrels each from four in the original
plan, according to a revised loading program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
