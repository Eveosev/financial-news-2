U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  said he will change the law to stop energy
companies claiming tax back against  capital costs  that have
already been paid by business customers.  Such claims, had they gone ahead, could have cost the
Treasury as much as 900 million pounds ($1.36 billion), Osborne
said in a statement on the Treasury website today.  “It is completely unacceptable that  utility companies 
think they can claim for huge amounts of money that business
customers have already covered the cost for,” Osborne said.
“By legislating today, we will prevent utility companies from
making these claims, ensuring fairness for British taxpayers.”  The Treasury said its move was a response to a recent
change in practice by utility companies, to attempt to claim
such costs back against tax. It is the latest example of  David Cameron ’s government moving against utility companies. Cameron
also wants to force them to put all customers on their cheapest
tariff.  To contact the reporter on this story:
