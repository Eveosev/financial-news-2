Bain Capital Partners LLC, a buyout
firm with about $70 billion under management, is considering a
larger presence in  Latin America  amid a decline in valuations in
 Brazil , the region’s largest economy.  “We are seeing more and more opportunities in the
information services and financial services sectors” of Latin
America, Stephen Pagliuca, a managing director at the Boston-based firm, said in an interview in Santiago. “In the next
three to five years, we look to have some kind of presence
here.”  Declines in the market valuations of companies in Brazil
have made prospects in that country look more attractive, he
said. The benchmark Brazilian Ibovespa has declined 10 percent
this year, the worst performance among major emerging-market
stock gauges. Brazil’s main equity index trades at 12.9 times
analysts’ earnings estimates for the next four quarters,
compared with 10.7 times for the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Valuations in Brazil have fallen a bit with the slower
economic growth, but even in economies with high valuations, if
we think a company can grow, we’ll invest,” he said.  Bain agreed in October to pay 1 billion euros ($1.29
billion) to  Spain ’s Telefonica SA for Atento SA, a call-center
operator with offices in 11 Latin American countries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
