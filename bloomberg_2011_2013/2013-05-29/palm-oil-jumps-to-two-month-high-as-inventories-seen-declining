Palm oil climbed for a fifth day to a
two-month high on speculation that inventories in  Malaysia  may
decline for a fifth month as output slows and exports recover in
the world’s second-biggest producer.  The contract for August delivery advanced as much as 1.3
percent to 2,420 ringgit ($792) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the highest level for the most active
contract since March 28, before ending the morning session at
2,419 ringgit in  Kuala Lumpur . Futures are up 5.8 percent in
May, heading for the biggest monthly gain since February 2012,
on expectation demand may rebound ahead of the Muslim fasting
month of Ramadan, which starts in July this year.  “People were concerned earlier about weak demand but it
has picked up and that is positive,” said Ivy Ng, an analyst at
CIMB Investment Bank Bhd. “The expectations of softer
production in May because palm trees are having a bit of a
breather could lead to lower palm oil stocks.”  Malaysian  reserves  have dropped 27 percent to 1.93 million
tons in April from a record in December, according to data from
the nation’s  palm oil  board. Output rose 3.1 percent to 1.37
million tons in April, board data shows. Shipments fell 2.1
percent to 1.06 million tons in the first 25 days of May from
the same period in April, surveyor  Societe Generale  de
Surveillance said May 27. That compares with an 18 percent
decline in the first 10 days.  “Because of soybeans’ high price, palm oil continues to be
an attractive alternative for a lot of the countries” which
observe Ramadan, Ng said. Palm oil and  soybean oil  are
substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Soybeans for July delivery climbed 0.4 percent to $15.1575
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade today, extending a 2.2
percent surge yesterday, and soybean oil for the same month rose
0.3 percent to 49.69 cents a pound.  Refined palm oil for September delivery gained 0.9 percent
to 6,222  yuan  ($1,015) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange ,
while soybean oil advanced 1.1 percent to 7,578 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
