Lumber futures fell the most in 17
months on speculation that North American mills from  Texas  to
 Alberta  are boosting output.  Lumber soared 44 percent last year as a jump in U.S.
housing starts strained supplies following a cut in capacity
during the property slump. Mills coming back online are easing
constraints, said Steven Chercover, an analyst at DA Davidson &
Co. in  Lake Oswego , Oregon. Today, futures declined the most
allowed by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange for the second
straight day and reached a seven-month low.  “Supply is coming back on stream and catching up to
demand,” Chercover said yesterday in a report. “Workers are
returning to the mills and the timberlands. End-users are
minimizing or deferring purchases in order to get what they need
cheaper next week.”  About 55.5 billion of the industry’s standard board feet
will be made this year, 6.7 percent more than in 2012,  CIBC
World Markets  estimated last month. That marked the fastest pace
in six years after the rebound in U.S. housing, a beetle
infestation in  Canada  and increasing Chinese demand drove last
year’s rally, the biggest in two decades.  Lumber futures for July delivery declined by the limit of
$10 to settle at $277.40 per 1,000 board feet at 1:18 p.m. on
the CME, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 10.
The commodity fell 3.5 percent, the most since Dec. 12, 2011.  Futures dropped for the sixth straight session. In May, the
price has tumbled 21 percent, heading for the biggest monthly
decline in three years.  This year, lumber has slumped 26 percent, outpacing 24 raw
materials in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, which has
declined 3.6 percent. In 2012, the surge in lumber topped the
components in the broad gauge.  Housing starts  in the U.S. averaged 783,000 a month last
year, up 28 percent from 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
