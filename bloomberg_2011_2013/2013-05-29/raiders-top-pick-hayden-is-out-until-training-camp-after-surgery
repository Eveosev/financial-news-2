Oakland Raiders cornerback and top
draft pick D.J. Hayden will miss the rest of the team’s early
practice sessions after having a buildup of scar tissue removed
from his abdomen.  Hayden had surgery in November to repair a blood vessel
near his heart that was torn in a collision with a teammate
during football practice at the University of Houston. Raiders
coach Dennis Allen told reporters yesterday that the scar
tissue, which was causing Hayden stomach pain, may be related to
the player’s previous injury.  Allen said he has “no worries” that Hayden, the 12th pick
in this year’s National Football League draft, will be back for
the Raiders’ training camp in July.  Last week’s procedure to remove the scar tissue was
precautionary and, barring complications, isn’t a major concern
for the Raiders,  NFL.com reported , citing an unidentified person
familiar with the situation.  Hayden was injured as a senior at Houston when he tore his
inferior vena cava, which carries blood from the lower half of
the body back to the heart. Houston’s team doctor, Walter Lowe,
said at the time that Hayden’s injury, usually associated with
high-speed motor vehicle crashes, was  95 percent fatal  in the
field.  To contact the reporter on this story:
