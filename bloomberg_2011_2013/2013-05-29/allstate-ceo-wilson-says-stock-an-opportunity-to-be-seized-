Thomas Wilson , the chief executive
officer of Allstate Corp., said the company’s stock is an
“opportunity to be seized,” even after rallying.  “Last year, our shareholders had a total return of 50
percent, and so far this year shareholders have continued to be
rewarded with a return over 20 percent,” Wilson said today of
the Northbrook, Illinois-based auto and home insurer at a
conference sponsored by Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “Yet the
stock still trades at a book value multiple that’s substantially
below the long-term average.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
