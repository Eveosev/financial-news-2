Colombia’s peso bonds fell the most
since October 2011 as rising U.S. bond yields eroded demand for
emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark peso bonds due 2024
jumped 22 basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 5.62
percent at 2:11 p.m. in Bogota. It has climbed 75 basis points
in the past month, the biggest monthly increase since the
securities were sold in 2009.  Bonds and currencies have tumbled around the world this
month on speculation a pickup in the world’s biggest economy
will prompt the  Federal Reserve  to scale back monetary stimulus.
Ten-year U.S. Treasury  yields  earlier today rose to 2.23
percent, the highest level since April 5, 2012.  “Investors are getting out of  emerging markets  and going
back into developed countries,” said Daniel Velandia, head
analyst at Credicorp Capital’s Colombia unit. “In a question of
weeks, we’ve seen markets plunge everywhere.”  Colombia’s peso rose for the first time in nine days,
strengthening 0.3 percent to 1,892.40 per  U.S. dollar  at the
close of trading in Bogota. Yesterday it touched 1,902.97, the
weakest level since Jan. 4, 2012. The peso has fallen 6.6
percent this year.  The government and central bank have increased dollar
purchases in the foreign exchange market this year to stem a
rally that sent the peso to a 17-month high on Jan. 2. Finance
Minister  Mauricio Cardenas  said in an interview on Blu Radio
today that “there is a certain consensus that it’s necessary to
continue intervening” in the  currency market .  To contact the reporter on this story:
