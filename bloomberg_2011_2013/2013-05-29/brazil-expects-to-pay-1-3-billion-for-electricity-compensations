Brazil ’s President Dilma Rousseff
will sign today a presidential decree to allow the government to
compensate utilities a total of 2.8 billion reais ($1.3 billion)
to finance cuts in electricity tariffs, two ministers said.  “We anticipate the payment of 2.8 billion reais for power
distributors,” Brazil Energy Minister Edison Lobao told
reporters in Brasilia. “This money is due to be paid until
December and compensates distributors so that they do not pass
the price to consumers.”  The government is issuing the decree to continue using its
CDE fund for the power rate cuts, Rousseff’s Chief of Staff
Gleisi Hoffmann told reporters earlier today in Brasilia.  Brazil cut power rates last year in a bid to reduce
production costs and help curb inflation. It extended power
concession contracts while proposing lower tariffs be charged to
consumers and industry. Some companies, such as  Cia Energetica
de Minas Gerais (CMIG3)  and  Cia Energetica de Sao Paulo , rejected the
government’s proposal.  “We reinforce our commitment with the average 20 percent
power rate cut,” Lobao said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
