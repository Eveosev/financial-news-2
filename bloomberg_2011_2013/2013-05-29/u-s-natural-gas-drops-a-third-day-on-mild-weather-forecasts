Natural gas futures dropped a third
day in New York as forecasts for below-normal Midwest
temperatures early next month signaled reduced demand for
electricity to power air conditioners.  Gas for June delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent in
electronic trading to $4.156 per million British thermal units
on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The futures closed at
$4.174 yesterday as floor trading resumed after the U.S.
Memorial Day holiday.  The June contract expires today. The more actively traded
July futures were down 0.2 percent at $4.215, after closing at
$4.224 yesterday.  The Commodity Weather Group LLC in Bethesda,  Maryland ,
forecast mild weather for the Midwest in the first two weeks of
June. Temperatures will reach a high of 70 degrees Fahrenheit
(21 Celsius) in Chicago on June 4, 6 degrees below normal,
according to AccuWeather Inc. in State College,  Pennsylvania .  “We get three to five days of hot weather, then everything
shifts to normal to below-normal temperatures,”  Gene McGillian ,
an analyst and broker with Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut  said yesterday. “The middle part of the month is
going to be like that, and that’s why gas prices are under
pressure.”  The high in Atlanta will reach 74 degrees on June 8, 11
degrees below normal, according to AccuWeather. Baltimore’s high
will be 72 degrees on June 9, 11 degrees lower than average.  To contact the reporter on this story:
