Japan ’s  Topix index  rose a second
day, trimming losses from the biggest weekly slide since the
rally started in November, as power producers rebounded and
insurers climbed on higher bond yields.  The Topix utilities gauge rose 8.3 percent, advancing the
most among the broader index’s 33  industry groups  after leading
declines yesterday. Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co. gained 1.9
percent as rising yields improved prospects for investment
returns.  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  added 2.1 percent after a person
familiar with the situation said its Sprint Nextel Corp.
acquisition will probably pass a U.S national-security review.  The Topix gained 0.9 percent to 1,178.87 at the close of
trading in Tokyo. The gauge rebounded for a second day after
sliding almost 10 percent in the previous three days, the first
significant setback in a nine-month rally that’s lifted Japan’s
broadest equities gauge 61 percent.  “The market bottom is getting stronger,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset
Management Co., which oversees the equivalent of $100 billion.
“A bigger variety of investors, such as individuals, are buying
on dips. The market hasn’t priced in the full effects of the
potential recovery in the economy.”  The  Nikkei 225 (NKA)  Stock Average added 0.1 percent to
14,326.46. The gauge lagged behind the Topix as Fast Retailing
Co. and Fanuc Corp., which together account for 15 percent of
the benchmark, declined. A measure of the Nikkei’s volatility
was about 60 percent above the average for the past year after
retreating a fourth day from its highest since March 2011.  Futures on the Nikkei 225 dropped 0.8 percent to 14,250.  U.S. Confidence  Contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2
percent. The gauge rose 0.6 percent yesterday, extending its
advance this month to 3.9 percent, after U.S.  consumer
confidence  climbed to the highest since 2008 and home values
jumped the most in seven years.  The Topix’s Electric Power & Gas index advanced the most in
more than a month today, led by Tohoku Electric Power Co. and
Kyushu Electric Power Co., which each gained more than 15
percent.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., owner of the striken Fukushima
nuclear power plant, added 8.7 percent after sliding 20 percent
in the previous five trading sessions. Kyodo News yesterday
reported a parliamentary committee approved a bill allowing
victims of the Fukushima disaster to seek compensation beyond a
three-year claims limit.  Insurers And Yields  Insurers were the second-biggest gainers among Topix
industry groups after the yield on Japan’s 10-year  government
bonds  jumped 4 1/2 basis points to 0.95 percent. Government
bonds acount for more than 40 percent of assets held by Japan’s
insurers,  according to  the latest figures from the Life
Insurance Association of Japan.  Dai-ichi Life added 1.9 percent to 145,500 yen. T&D
Holdings Inc. increased 3.6 percent to 1,337 yen. NKSJ Holdings
Inc. jumped 7.7 percent to 2,502 yen. NKSJ also rose after an
executive said the insurer will consider selling cross-held
shares worth about $3.6 billion.  SoftBank, Japan’s third-largest wireless carrier, added 2.1
percent to 5,320 yen. The U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment
is close to passing a national security review on SoftBank’s
$20.1 billion takeover of Sprint, the third-largest U.S.
wireless carrier, according to a person familiar with the
matter, who asked not to be named because the information hasn’t
been announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
