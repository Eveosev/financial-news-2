Steel reinforcement-bar futures were
little changed near the lowest level in six months after iron
ore prices fell and Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang  indicated a shift
from rapid expansion to stable growth.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange fell as much as 0.7 percent to 3,465 yuan a ($565) a
ton, the lowest level for a most-active contract since Nov. 30,
and was at 3,489 yuan at 10:15 a.m. local time. Futures are set
for a fourth monthly decline.  Li told German business leaders during a visit to  Europe 
that his country is confronted by “huge challenges” as it
seeks 7 percent annual growth this decade, down from more than
10 percent in the previous 10 years. Ore with 62 percent iron
content delivered to Tianjin port fell 2.6 percent to $117.80 a
dry ton yesterday, the lowest level since December, according to
The Steel Index Ltd. data.  “The market is gauging the pace of the government’s
actions against a weak cash market,” Wang Yongliang, an analyst
at Beijing Cifco Futures Co., said by phone from Tianjin.  The average  spot price  for rebar fell 0.3 percent to 3,520
 yuan  yesterday, the lowest since September, according to data
from Beijing Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
