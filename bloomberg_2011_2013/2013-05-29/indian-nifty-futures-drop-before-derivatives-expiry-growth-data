Indian stock-index futures dropped
before the expiry of derivatives contracts and the release of
economic growth data this week.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for May delivery fell 0.2
percent to 6,097 at 9:48 a.m. in  Singapore . The contract expires
tomorrow. The underlying CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index rose 0.5 percent to
6,111.25 yesterday. The S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.7 percent. The
Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR Index of U.S.-traded shares
jumped 2.1 percent, the biggest gain since April 30.  Gross domestic product  increased  4.8 percent in the three
months through March, according to the median of 33 estimates in
a Bloomberg survey before data due May 31. The Indian economy
grew 4.5 percent in the previous quarter, the slowest pace since
2009. The Sensex’s  15-day volatility , a gauge of price swings,
rose to 19.9 yesterday, the highest level in more than a year.  “We expect a volatile trading session today ahead of the
expiry of the monthly derivatives contract,” Kishor Ostwal,
managing director of CNI Research (India) Ltd., said by phone
today. “Liquidity is strong and corporate earnings have been
better-than-expected so far, which limits the downside.”  Foreign investors bought a net $69.7 million of  Indian (SENSEX) 
stocks on May 27, taking this year’s inflows to $14.6 billion, a
record for the period according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Profits at just five of the 25 companies in the benchmark gauge
that have reported March-quarter earnings so far have  trailed 
 estimates , compared with 43 percent in the three months ended
Dec. 31, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Tata Motors  Shares of  Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , India’s biggest automaker, may
be active on concerns its Indian operations may report a record
loss. The company may say today that group profit slumped 57
percent in the quarter ended March 30, according to the median
estimate of 40 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , India’s largest state-owned oil
explorer, may say its fourth-quarter profit fell 13 percent to
49.3 billion rupees ($881 million), according to the median
estimate of 36 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Drugmaker  Cipla Ltd. (CIPLA)  may report a 13 percent increase in
quarterly net income, according to 32 analysts in a Bloomberg
survey.  Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (SUNP) , India’s most valuable
drugmaker, may move after net income rose 23 percent to 10.1
billion rupees, beating the 9.17 billion-rupee median forecast.  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , India’s second-largest aluminum
producer, reported net income fell 25 percent to 4.82 billion
rupees, still beating the 3.87 billion rupees estimated by
analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  The Sensex has risen 3.8 percent in 2013, climbing to the
highest in more than two years on May 17, as monetary easing by
central banks from Europe to the U.S. and Japan stoked inflows
into  emerging markets . The gauge is valued at 13.9 times
 projected 12-month profits , compared with the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index’s 10.4 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
