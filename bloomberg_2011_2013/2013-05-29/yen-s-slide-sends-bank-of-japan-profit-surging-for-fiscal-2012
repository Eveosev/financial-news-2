The  Bank of Japan  is the latest
beneficiary of a sliding yen, reporting a doubling of operating
profit for the fiscal year through March.  Weakness in the Japanese currency was the main reason that
operating profit rose to an 11-year high of 1.132 trillion yen
($11.1 billion) from 536 billion yen in the previous year, the
central bank said in a statement in today in  Tokyo . The BOJ’s
assets rose 18 percent to a record 164.8 trillion yen.  Japan ’s currency began falling against the dollar late last
year as Shinzo Abe pledged unlimited monetary easing ahead of
the December election that led to him being installed as prime
minister. The currency is down 19 percent in six months, after
central bank Governor Haruhiko Kuroda unveiled in April a plan
to double the money in the economy over two years.  The weakening yen, which boosts profits of Japanese
exporters such as  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , increased the value of
foreign-denominated assets such as bonds and deposits, the
central bank said. The BOJ posted a net income of 576 billion
yen, 95 percent of which will go into the national treasury.  The central bank’s capital ratio rose for the first time in
six years to 7.45 percent from 7.22 percent last year. The bank
had unrealized profits of 550 billion yen from its exchange-traded fund holdings and 71.8 billion yen in unrealized gains on
Japanese real-estate investment trusts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
