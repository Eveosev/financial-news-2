Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  is reorganizing its
debt team in Asia as Mark Whitcroft, a syndicate director in
Singapore, relocates to the U.S.  Guillaume Du Cheyron, who most recently worked in Citigroup
Inc.’s origination team in Hong Kong, joins the German lender as
a director in fixed-income  capital markets , according to an e-mailed statement from the bank. Haitham Ghattas, current co-head
of leveraged debt capital markets for Asia, has been appointed
as Asia head of high-yield syndicate, effective July 1,
according to the statement.  “These moves to augment Deutsche Bank’s origination and
syndication of Asian fixed-income ensure we continue to offer
our best-in-class advisory and execution services to both
corporate and institutional clients,” Herman van den Wall Bake,
the Asia head of fixed-income capital markets, said in the
release.  Deutsche Bank’s latest reorganization follows van den Wall
Bake’s appointment last year after Patrick Tsang left the
lender. The bank relocated Jake Gearhart to Singapore from  New
York  shortly after as the head of global risk syndicate for
Asia. Whitcroft is now heading in the opposite direction, to
focus on U.S. corporate debt syndication in New York, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
