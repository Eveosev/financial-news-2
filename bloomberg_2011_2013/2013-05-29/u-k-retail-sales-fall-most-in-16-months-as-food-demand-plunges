U.K. retail sales  fell the most in 16
months in May as demand for food and drink declined, according
to an index by the  Confederation of British Industry .  A gauge of annual sales growth dropped to minus 11, the
lowest since January 2012, from minus 1 in April, the London-based lobby group said today. Economists had forecast an
increase to 3, according to the median of 12 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey. Retailers expect the volume of sales to
return to growth in June, the report showed.  Higher energy prices and weak wage growth have helped to
curb  consumer spending . Data earlier this month showed that
 expenditure by households  rose just 0.1 percent in the first
quarter, the least since the third quarter of 2011.  “Most sub-sectors reported flat or falling sales over the
year, with only furniture and carpets and recreational goods
seeing strong growth,” the CBI said. Still, “a narrow balance
of retailers again expect the overall business situation to
improve over the next three months, with three quarters
expecting conditions to remain stable.”  A gauge of the volume of orders placed with suppliers
dropped to minus 25 in May from minus 12 in April. A measure of
sales volumes for the time of year rose to minus 17 from minus
27. A three-month moving average of sales slipped to minus 6
from minus 4.  In a separate quarterly survey, the CBI said a gauge of
retailers’ investment intentions dropped to minus 23 in May from
minus 7 in February. That’s the weakest since February 2012. The
quarterly view of the current business situation fell to 10 from
12.  The CBI’s survey of 69 retailers was conducted between
April 24 and May 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
