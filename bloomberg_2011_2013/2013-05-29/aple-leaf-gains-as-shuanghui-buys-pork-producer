Maple Leaf Foods Inc. (MFI) , the Canadian
meat processor, climbed the most in nine months after China’s
biggest pork producer agreed to buy  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  for
about about $4.72 billion to meet Chinese demand for pork.  Maple Leaf rose 4.5 percent to C$12.97 at the close in
Toronto, the biggest increase since Aug. 1. Before today,  the
shares  had gained 3.7 percent this year.  Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd. agreed to pay a 31
percent premium over the Smithfield, Virginia-based producer’s
closing share price yesterday to secure fresh supplies amid
rising pork consumption in China. Smithfield’s livestock unit is
the world’s largest hog producer, bringing about 15.8 million of
the animals to market a year.  A reorganization at Maple Leaf and a 2012 acquisition have
made the company a “leader in hog production in  Canada ,”
according to its website. Maple Leaf, which also makes bread,
pasta and frozen-food products, has a market value of C$1.82
billion ($1.76 billion).  To contact the reporter on this story:
