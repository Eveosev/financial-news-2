French plans to build a nuclear-waste
repository were set back when two public meetings were postponed
by local opposition.  A debate scheduled for tomorrow in Saint Didier,
northeastern  France , and another in the nearby town of Joinville
on June 6 have been pushed back, organizers said in a  statement 
yesterday. The new dates are yet to be determined.  France is looking to store radioactive waste from
 Electricite de France SA ’s 58 reactors, as well as from  Areva SA (AREVA) 
and atomic-research organization CEA, at a site near Bure, which
straddles the Meuse and Haute-Marne regions. The plans have
already faced opposition as protests last week forced the
cancellation of the first in a series of public consultations.  Debates on projects that have an impact on the environment
and regional development “are a right and are protected by the
law,” the organizers said in the statement, calling for
“tolerance and openness.” The meetings, scheduled through Oct.
15, must be held before the government and the regulator can
decide whether to approve the  project .  Andra, the waste-management agency spearheading the plan,
is seeking to start construction in 2019 and begin operations in
2025.  To contact the reporter on this story:
