Russian  shares  sank to a month-low as
oil dropped and OAO Russian Grids fell before its removal from a
benchmark gauge. Emerging-market equities slumped.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  decreased 2.3 percent to 1,365.91 by 2:41
p.m. in Moscow, the weakest intraday level since April 30. OAO
Tatneft, an oil producer, lost 4.1 percent to 193.30 rubles,
while OAO Gazprom traded down 2.4 percent at 118.31 rubles.
Russian Grids, a power distribution and transmission company,
fell 3.8 percent to 1.32 rubles.  MSCI Inc. said this month it will remove Russian Grids,
which has tumbled 33 percent this year, from its Russia Index.
Investors who track the measure must sell the stock when the
changes come into effect June 3. Crude, Russia’s main export
earner, declined 0.6 percent to $94.43 a barrel in New York and
 emerging-market stocks  retreated on wagers the U.S. will scale
back stimulus.  “Speculators are selling Russian Grids before the MSCI
rebalancing,” Alexander Kostyukov, an analyst at Veles Capital
in Moscow, said by phone. “ Russia  depends on foreign
investments and the thought of the U.S. curbing its stimulus
program scares the market.”  The Micex tumbled the most in a year on May 23, the day
after U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the
central bank could reduce the pace of its asset purchases if
officials see signs of sustained improvement in growth. The Fed
buys $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage debt a month to
support the economy by putting downward pressure on interest
rates.  Sberbank, Rates  OAO Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender with the second-biggest weighting on the Micex, slumped 3.2 percent to 100.71
rubles, the lowest intraday level since May 3.  Andrey Kostin, chief executive officer of VTB Group,
Sberbank’s smaller rival, appealed to policy makers in a May 22
interview to cut interest rates to help encourage lending amid
Russia’s slowest expansion since a 2009 contraction. The central
bank kept its  main interest rates  on hold for an eighth month in
May.  “Russian market participants had expected the nation’s
central bank to cut rates this month, but this didn’t happen and
there are no other growth triggers,” Kostyukov said.  Sberbank posted a better-than-forecast 3.9 percent drop in
net income to 88.6 billion rubles ($2.8 billion) in the first
quarter from a year earlier, according to a statement today.  Lowering the refinancing rate to between 5 percent and 6
percent from 8.25 percent would allow banks to reduce loan costs
and make “a big difference for the industry,” Kostin said.
Both VTB and Sberbank are majority-owned by the Russian state.  PIK Offering  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 17 percent
below the 30-day average, while 10-day price swings increased to
31.653, the highest since May 2012.  Tatneft’s global depositary receipts led declines on the
Russian Depositary Index, losing 4.5 percent to $37. Gazprom’s
GDRs fell 2.7 percent to $7.47.  PIK Group (PIKK)  fell 3.3 percent to 63 rubles, the most since
April 19. The Russian residential developer snapped six days of
gains after announcing a 22.7 billion ruble offering of new
shares at 62.5 rubles apiece today. The number of shares traded
was 2.6 million, equivalent to about 8.3 times the three-month
average.  The Micex rallied 1.4 percent yesterday, climbing for the
first time in four days, after U.S. data showed home prices rose
in the 12 months through March by the most in seven years and
consumer sentiment climbed more than forecast.  Russian equities have the cheapest valuations among 21
 emerging markets  tracked by Bloomberg. The Micex trades at 5
times its 12-month estimated earnings and has lost 6.9 percent
this year, compared with a 10.4 multiple for the MSCI Emerging
Markets Index, which has dropped 2.8 percent in the period.  The dollar-denominated  RTS Index (RTSI$)  decreased 2.6 percent to
1,362.99. The Russian Volatility Index surged 11 percent to
25.03. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. declined 0.7 percent to 91.38
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
