OAO Sberbank (SBRCY) ,  Russia ’s largest
lender, will extend this year’s rally by a further 26 percent as
loan growth outweighs concern that profit is falling, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Shares of Sberbank, which slumped today after posting a
drop in net income, is set for a fourth quarterly gain, the
longest stretch of advances since March 2010. The stock tumbled
2.4 percent at 12:50 p.m. in Moscow and 2.7 percent in  London ,
after losing 1.6 percent in New York yesterday. The Micex Index
fell 1.8 percent.  While Sberbank’s net income attributable to shareholders
slid 3.9 percent to 88.6 billion rubles ($2.8 billion) by
international accounting standards, that beat the mean estimate
of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg for an 8 percent
decline. Retail loans increased 6 percent in the first five
months of the year compared with a year earlier, while corporate
loans fell 0.1 percent, according to a May 14 financial report.  “We remain buyers as loan growth may be recovering and
valuations continue looking compelling,” Alex Kantarovich, the
head of Russian equity research at JPMorgan in Moscow, who has
an overweight rating for Sberbank since August and predicts the
shares will rise to 131.13 rubles by year-end, said by e-mail
yesterday. “The size and market share owing to the massive
footprint remains the main source of the bank’s competitive
advantage.”  Kantarovich’s prediction is 1.8 percent lower than the mean
of  19 analysts  that updated price estimates within the last
three months. On average, they predict the stock will rally 28
percent to $133.59 over the next 12 months.  Sberbank Gains  Sberbank was poised for the lowest level since May 2 at
101.48 in Moscow today. It has risen 9.2 percent in 2013,
compared with a 7 percent decline in Russia’s benchmark Micex
Index. The London stock retreated to $12.88, while the shares in
New York slumped to $13.06 yesterday. The ADR, which represents
four shares, trades at a 30 percent discount to the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Banks Index, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg based on estimated earnings.  For 2013, the lender’s net income will rise 4.2 percent to
363.5 billion rubles, according to the mean of 10 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Sberbank will narrow the discount to its emerging-market
peers if economic growth accelerates, according to analysts
including VTB Capital’s Mikhail Shlemov, and Ruslan Yunusov at
Olma Investments in Moscow. While the economy grew 2.1 percent
in the fourth quarter, the least since contracting in 2009, the
trend may reverse, with expansion set to exceed 3 percent in the
second half of the year, Economy Minister Andrei Belousov said
May 16.  Russia’s Economy  Sberbank expects corporate lending will increase as much as
14 percent in 2013, after expanding 18 percent last year, Deputy
Chairman Anton Karamzin said in an interview in  New York  April
5. Consumer loans will increase as much as 25 percent after
expanding 40 percent in 2012, he said.  Chief Financial Officer Herman Gref said May 23 that the
bank may lower lending rates this year. Sberbank is cutting
rates on some of its deposit accounts by May 31, Kommersant
reported on May 22, citing an interview with director Dmitry
Oguryaev.  The net interest margin, a gauge of the profitability of
lending, may have shrunk by as much as 6 percent in the first
quarter, BCS Financial Group said.  ‘Further Pressure’  “Net interest margins would be under further pressure
given ongoing rate cuts,” Shlemov, at VTB in Moscow, said by
phone yesterday. “Slower economic growth leads to less demand
for funding. Sberbank is trying to stimulate the demand by
cutting the cost of lending. That is the beginning of a new
trend.”  The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Russian stocks in the U.S. lost 0.7 percent to 91.38 yesterday
and RTS stock-index futures decreased 0.9 percent to 138,590.
The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in the
 stock futures , climbed 10 percent to 24.83 today. The  Market
Vectors Russia ETF (RSX) , the largest exchange-traded fund dedicated
to Russian equities, slipped 0.6 percent to $26.76.  Crude for July delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $94.33 a
barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  today. Brent for July
settlement retreated 0.4 percent to $103.82 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange today.  Urals crude ,
Russia’s major export blend, fell 0.5 percent to $103.33.  The ruble fell 0.2 percent to 31.5655 per dollar today and
declined 0.2 percent to 35.6806 against the dollar-euro basket
used by the central bank to manage swings that erode exporter
competitiveness.  United Co. Rusal (486) , the world’s largest aluminum producer,
dropped 2.1 percent to HK$3.68 in  Hong Kong  today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
