Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
has restarted some operations at its Grasberg complex in
Indonesia, the world’s second-largest copper mine, after a May
14 accident that killed 28 and halted output.  The company is slowly resuming operations after work began
again at the Grasberg open-pit and mill on May 28, Phoneix-based
Freeport’s local unit said yesterday in an e-mailed statement.
Mine inspectors from the Ministry of Energy and  Mineral
Resources  completed a preliminary investigation of the accident
and issued recommendations to the company, Freeport said.  The mine may reach a full production rate of 140,000 metric
tons of ore a day in three to four days, Rozik B. Soetjipto,
president director of local unit PT Freeport Indonesia, said
yesterday in Jakarta. Freeport hasn’t got approval yet to
restart its underground mine, he said.  The halt came one month after Rio Tinto Group suspended its
Bingham Canyon mine in Utah following a landslide. Copper in
London retreated yesterday as concerns for reduced supplies of
the metal eased.  Freeport is performing maintenance on the underground
operations at Grasberg and expects to ramp up production after
authorities have completed inspections, it said in the statement
yesterday. Freeport Indonesia is still shipping some
concentrate, Soetjipto said.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) ’s Escondida mine in Chile is the largest
 copper mine .  To contact the reporters on this story:
