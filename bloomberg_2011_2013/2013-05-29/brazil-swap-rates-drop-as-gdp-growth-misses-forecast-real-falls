Brazil ’s swap rates dropped as a
report showed first-quarter economic growth was slower than
forecast, encouraging speculation that central bank will limit
increases in borrowing costs today.  Swap rates on the contract due in January fell seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 8.06 percent at 9:45 a.m.
in Sao Paulo. The real depreciated 0.1 percent to 2.0775 per
U.S. dollar, the weakest level on a closing basis since Dec. 24.  Gross domestic product grew 1.9 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, the national statistics agency
reported. The median forecast of analysts surveyed by Bloomberg
was for an expansion of 2.3 percent. The central bank will
increase the target lending rate by a quarter-percentage point
to 7.75 percent today, according to the median forecast.  “GDP growth met our expectations but missed the market
average forecasts,”  Andre Perfeito , the chief economist at
Gradual Investimentos, said by phone from Sao Paulo. “That
suggests the monetary policy decision will be less aggressive.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
