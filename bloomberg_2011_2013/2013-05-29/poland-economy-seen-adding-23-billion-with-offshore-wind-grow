Poland ’s economy could swell by 73.8
billion zloty ($23 billion) with an expansion of its offshore
wind energy program, an Ernst & Young study showed.  A commitment to build 6,000 megawatts of marine turbines by
2025 could create 31,800 jobs and avoid about 40 million tons of
carbon-dioxide emissions, the Polish Wind Energy Association
said today in a statement, citing the study it commissioned.  Poland, which hasn’t installed any offshore wind turbines,
plans to add 500 megawatts by 2020, according to Bloomberg New
Energy Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
