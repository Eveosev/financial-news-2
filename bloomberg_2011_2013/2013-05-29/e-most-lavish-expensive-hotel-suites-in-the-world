For the unfathomably rich and the internationally famous, hotel suites are safe havens, cloistered precincts where the powerful have affairs without consequence, exiled princes hide out, divas are coddled, and rock-and-roll stars swing from chandeliers. The very word suite suggests privilege and conjures up images of cocktails in sunken living rooms, small mountains of hatboxes, and glamorous love affairs. (As Sophia ­Loren once said, you can tell how much a man loves you by the hotel suite he books.) For the rest of us, though, they’re just a mystery on a floor our key cards won’t allow us to access, a set of bolted double doors through which we’ll never enter and onto which we project our fantasies. And there are a lot more of those doors being bolted these days: While much of the world digs for pennies in its change purse, there’s a growing market for hotel suites, driven both by the fortunate few who are impervious to economic downturns and to the swelling ranks of multi-millionaires and multi-billionaires around the world. These are no junior suites, mind you, which often offer little more than a few extra millimeters of space and a club chair. “There are relatively few luxury suites available, and there are ever more wealthy people looking for them,” says Sean Hennessey, CEO of the consulting group Lodging Advisors, in New York. To meet the increased demand, existing hotels are blowing out walls to rejigger floor plans, and new luxury hotels are devoting more and more square feet to one-, two-, and three-bedroom suites in their blueprints, industry analysts say. At the same time, hotels at the highest end of the spectrum are trying to outdo one another with bells, whistles, and over-the-top design. “Not just a little more space and a higher thread-count,” Hennessey says, “but something you just can’t get anywhere else.” Say, 10,000 square feet of elbow room, including a basketball court (the Hardwood Suite at the Palms Casino in Las Vegas), a full-size pool and a grand piano (the Presidential Suite at the  Hotel Bel-Air  in Los Angeles), or perhaps a wine cellar and bulletproof glass (the Penthouse Suite at the  Cavalieri Hilton  in Rome). These game-changing pads carry price tags to match their outsize ambitions: $45,000 a night is not a typo—it’s the actual rate for less than 24 hours in a maharaja’s former residence, which is now the Presidential Suite at Jaipur’s Raj Palace Hotel. More from  Condé Nast Traveler : Purely in the interest of the public’s right to know, I spent the night in eight of these inner sanctums from New York to Abu Dhabi. (Full disclosure:  Condé Nast Traveler  reporters usually travel unannounced, but the only way we could report this story—which took me halfway around the world in the style of kings and movie stars—was to let the hotels in on our secret and accept upgrades from the standard rooms we’d paid for. Any concern we would typically have about preferential treatment was not an issue: It comes standard with these rooms.) Step into a suit and you step into a world with different expectations and different rules than the one most of us inhabit. I felt it as soon as I set foot in the foyer of the Prince of Wales Suite at Vienna’s  Hotel Bristol , with its inlaid marble floor and twinkling crystal chandelier, and proceeded to walk from room to room to room (eight in all), taking in the many gilded details of the Old World: the windowed bathroom, redolent of Bulgari, with taps made of gold; the stately, dark-wood dining room that was installed—complete with a fireplace and lustrous oil portraits—for the prince in advance of his second visit. Down a hallway was another splendid entrance to the suite and a shiny marble powder room; a walk-in closet and a little fitness room with a sauna; and then, a study, with a manly desk on which sat a quill, and smoky mirrored panels on one side, heavily curtained windows on the other. Goodness, I thought, if this place is fit for a prince, who wants to be king? (Edward had similar thoughts, of course. . .) These rooms come with a measure of entitlement much as others come with extra towels. Just ask Barbra Streisand: When she stayed here and discovered that the bed was too high for her little dog to leap up onto, the hotel had a tiny set of stairs built for the pooch. But that’s typical of the sort of service these suites offer. Many hotels provide butlers, but not many of them show up in white gloves, as mine did, to present me with personalized stationery: “In case you want to write a letter,” as Christian, my blond-haired, blue-eyed footman in the Royal Suite at Vienna’s  Hotel Imperial  explained. Christian even dutifully ironed my morning paper to spare my fair hands the ink. The Royal Suite—which has been occupied by boldfaced names including Emperor Akihito (he had a piano installed for the empress, who stayed in an adjoining room) to the Rolling Stones—is regal and feminine, like a dream of Old Europe, complete with a white writing desk in a corner of the sprawling bedroom.  How many marriage proposals were politely declined from atop its blotter?  I wondered, as my head sank into a pile of pillows under a throne of a headboard. Rarely have I felt more ladylike. For top hotels, a glorious suite—laden with either history or state-of-the-art equipment—can be like a tiara that rarely gets worn but casts a glow on the rest of the rooms. On the other hand, some companies have the ­ultra-posh hotel rooms as a bauble to offer the high roller, the very famous, or the odd head of state—who might not pay a dime out of his own pocket (except tips, of course, which do add up). And so they can reflect different tastes and, indeed, cultures. Consider two extraordinary suites in the burgeoning city of Abu Dhabi in the United Arab Emirates. The modern four-bedroom Royal Etihad Suite at the new  Jumeirah at Etihad Towers  takes up the entire sixtieth floor. The sweeping views over the gulf of this little oil kingdom will make your nose bleed and set you back $18,000 a night. This estate-in-the-sky is appointed with 74 different types of marble and such furnishings as would make Scarface himself blush—crushed silver velvet on the seat of a white-lacquered armchair, for example. The suite is divided into a dark side and a bright side (essentially male and female) and has special suede-lined trays in the dressing rooms for laying out diamond chokers as well as elaborate flower arrangements, like a vase of yellow calla lilies the size of a compact car. Stealthy staff come and go through a muffled door in the pantry: It’s funny how quickly you adapt to attendants, and they to you. From the moment I arrived, my staff—from driver to butler—were solicitous and respectful, and entirely male. Once I—a Western woman traveling on my own—had settled in, Amanda, a young lady from China, took over all duties, from changing currency to pulling out my chair at breakfast the next morning in the Executive Club Lounge (exclusive to suite guests and decorated with original Matisse and Picasso drawings).  Contrast this with the  Palace Suites at the Emirates Palac e , the state-owned urban resort across from the Jumeirah at Etihad Towers. The vast property is capped by a grand central dome, under which are several floors of suites, the most opulent of them reserved for kings and presidents. Here, the swipe of a golden plastic “coin” opened the door to a princess’s quarters in a life-size dollhouse—with beige marble columns; fixtures in matte gold; fabrics in muted creams, blues, and yellows; and lots of ottomans. It is lovely in the same way designer shoe salons in the world’s fancy department stores are. And here was Muktar, my soft-spoken Indian butler, apprentice in tow (learning to do things such as open a bottle of wine, which it appeared he had never done before). Muktar said he was proud to have served the likes of Shakira and Coldplay and that he was forbidden to speak to George Bush the Younger, who would come and go via private elevator. “But we saw him a lot,” said Muktar, beaming. Staff at New York’s Waldorf-Astoria saw him a lot, too, when he was in office. The hotel’s presidential suite, on the thirty-fifth floor of the property’s Waldorf Towers wing, is the only one where every American president since Herbert Hoover has spent the night. Decorated in Georgian style, the interior is reminiscent of the Oval Office. Its palette of creams and golds and blues is inspired by the presidential seal—which I found on plates in the dining room’s breakfront and etched into glass on the sconces in the living room. Spending the night here felt like I was staying in a miniature wing of the Smithsonian. Between the fireplace and Eisenhower’s desk is the small wooden rocking chair given as a gift by John F. Kennedy. In the bedroom—surprisingly modest in size (about the size of a standard motel room) and somber in decor—you can draft a speech at General MacArthur’s desk, which dates back to the years when he lived at the Waldorf with his wife. I was surprised, to put it nicely, to see that the kitchen cabinets look original to Eisenhower’s time and that the toilet in the neighboring bathroom, used for staff, I guess, needed a flushing. Strangely, the windows, which look out onto neighboring office buildings, are not state-of-the-art bullet-proof, but the place is transformed into a fortress before POTUS takes up residence: Surrounding streets are blocked off and snipers placed in strategic positions; agents secure the floor above and the floor below and X-ray the walls, ceiling, and floors. The suite is pre-wired for the White House’s sophisticated secure communications system, but try as I might, I was never able to get President Obama on the line to ask him how he fit his six-foot-one-inch frame into the compact, old-fashioned shower that must have been installed in the 1930s. About a mile uptown, the two-story Empire Suite at  The Carlyle  offers plenty of room in the shower, cashmere-covered walls, and all the other trappings of the very best homes, which is not surprising given that it actually was home for ten years to Millard Drexler, CEO of J. Crew. The suite has stunning views and a lived-in feel—too lived-in, perhaps. The scattering of fingernail clippings I found on the living room floor were promptly vacuumed away after a call to housekeeping, but the mood just wasn’t the same. The boom in Asian and Arab travelers, many of whom tend to move about with an entourage, has made epic, multi-bedroom sprawls commonplace—and, experts say, their numbers will only increase. The tastes of these growing markets will also increasingly dictate everything from which channels you can find on the 51-inch Bang & Olufson TV (Al-Jazeera, anyone?) to the $25 cake of soap in the powder room. At the Aria Sky Villas in Las Vegas, for instance, the toiletries are by Hermès and come in full sizes, including a 3.3-ounce bottle of eau de toilette that retails for $130. “The Asian market likes labels,” says Paul A. Berry, vice president of hotel operations at Aria Resorts and Casino, “and is most comfortable with Hermès.” The competition in luxury is very high, and so hotels are putting out more effort,” says Katrina Garnett, CEO of private equity firm Garnett Ventures in Silicon Valley and founder of the travel Web site My Little Swans. Garnett thinks of the Georges V in Paris as a kind of home away from home and recalls that during a recent stay, the model-pretty driver who came with her suite spent a day taking her teenage daughter shopping and filled the car with macarons from Ladurée for the children. They don’t call it the sweet life for nothing. It can be a tough habit to break. My friend Susie Theordorou, a food stylist who has traveled the world working with the likes of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, is fond of a minimalist two-­bedroom suite with a full kitchen at the Hotel Shangri-La in Santa Monica. There she can put up her assistant, test recipes, entertain clients, and kick back with a view of the sea after housekeeping has cleaned up. Is it difficult for her to go back to a standard room? “Yes,” she says. “It’s a little bit like flying business-class—after that, it’s hard to be in economy.” As I descended from my Sky Villa in Las Vegas—with its 15 televisions, his-and-her bathrooms, and pool table—slid into the back of the complimentary stretch limo, and waved good-bye to my two butlers standing curbside at the private entrance, I certainly knew how she felt.
