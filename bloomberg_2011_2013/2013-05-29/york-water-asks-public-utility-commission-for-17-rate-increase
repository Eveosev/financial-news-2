York Water Co. (YORW) , the oldest investor-owned water utility in the U.S., filed for an almost 17 percent
rate increase with the Pennysylvania Public Utility Commission
to raise about $7.1 million in annual revenue.  Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Hines said today in a
statement the company filed for the raise after making $49
million in infrastructure improvements since its last rate
increase in 2010, including wastewater upgrades. If approved,
the increase and a 25 percent raise for wastewater customers
will help York replace 30 miles of aging pipeline and cut leak
losses for about 190,000 people it serves, York said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
