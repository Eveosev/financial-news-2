Asian  stocks  rose for a second day as
reports showed U.S.  consumer confidence  increased to the highest
level since 2008 and home values jumped the most in seven years.
Japanese utilities climbed.  Nissan Motor Co. (7201) , a Japanese carmaker that gets 79 percent
of its revenue abroad, added 1.2 percent in  Tokyo . Tohoku
Electric Power Co. surged 22 percent, leading power companies to
the biggest advance on  Japan ’s Topix index.  Korea Electric Power
Corp. (015760)  lost 5.1 percent in Seoul as brokerages from Daishin
Securities to Shinyong Securities cut price forecasts on shares
of the state-owned firm, saying suspended operations at some
nuclear reactors may reduce profit.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index advanced 0.4 percent to 137.73
as of 7:33 p.m. in Hong Kong, with about three shares rising for
every two that declined. Seven of the 10 industry groups on the
gauge climbed. Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
slipped 0.6 percent.  “An improving U.S. economy should support earnings and
valuations,” said Johannes Jooste, who helps oversee more than
$1.76 trillion as a market strategist at Merrill Lynch Wealth
Management in  London . “Although  Bank of Japan  Governor Haruhiko
Kuroda has signaled no extension to his monetary stimulus
package, loose Japanese monetary policy should remain a bolster
for local liquidity.”  Relative Value  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index, the benchmark regional
equities gauge, traded at 13.4 times average estimated earnings
yesterday compared with 15.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
and 13.6 times for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Asia Pacific gauge fell 3.5 percent
this month through yesterday, on course for its first decline in
seven months.  The  Topix index , Japan’s broadest equity gauge, added 0.9
percent today, with a measure of 30-day historical volatility
climbing to 30.93, the highest since April 2011. The Topix,
which plunged 6.9 percent on May 23, the most since the
aftermath of the March 2011 earthquake, tsunami and nuclear
disaster, is still about 37 percent higher this year, beating
all major global equity indexes amid unprecedented monetary
easing by the central bank.  The Topix’s Electric Power & Gas index advanced the most in
more than a month today, as Tohoku Electric soared 22 percent to
1,271 yen and Kyushu Electric Power Co. surged 16 percent to
1,489 yen.  Australia’s  S&P/ASX 200 (AS51)  Index gained 0.1 percent and New
Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.2 percent. South Korea’s  Kospi
index (KOSPI)  advanced 0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index slid 1.6
percent and  China ’s Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.1 percent.  Consumer Confidence  U.S. consumer confidence climbed in May to the highest
level in more than five years, a Conference Board report showed
yesterday. The index rose to 76.2, the strongest since February
2008 and exceeding the highest estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists.  Separate data showed U.S. house prices rose in the 12
months through March by the most in seven years as the recovery
in residential real estate gained momentum. The S&P/Case-Shiller
index of property values increased 10.9 percent from March 2012,
the biggest 12-month gain since April 2006, after advancing 9.4
percent in February.  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  climbed 2.1 percent to 5,320 yen in Tokyo
after a person familiar with the situation said its takeover of
Sprint Nextel Corp. was close to passing a U.S national-security
review.  Korea Electric Power slid 5.1 percent to 27,200 won. The
Shin-Kori No. 2 and Shin-Wolsong No. 1 reactors will be shut for
about four months to replace control cables supplied under fake
