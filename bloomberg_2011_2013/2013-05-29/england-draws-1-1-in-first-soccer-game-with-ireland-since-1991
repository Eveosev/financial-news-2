England rallied for a 1-1 home draw
against Ireland in the teams’ first soccer match since their
1995 game was abandoned because of crowd violence.  Shane Long ’s headed goal after 13 minutes gave Ireland the
lead in last night’s exhibition game at Wembley Stadium in
London.  Frank Lampard  tied it 10 minutes later from close range
after Ireland failed to clear  Daniel Sturridge ’s low cross.  It’s the fourth straight 1-1 tie between the nations, whose
match at Lansdowne Road in Dublin 18 years ago was abandoned
with Ireland leading 1-0. England last beat Ireland on March 26,
1985, and lost 1-0 to the Irish in their next meeting, at the
1988 European Championships.  England has two more exhibition games, against Brazil in
 Rio de Janeiro  on June 2 and against Scotland at Wembley on Aug.
14, before qualifying for next year’s  World Cup  resumes in
September. England hosts Moldova on Sept. 6 before visiting
Ukraine four days later. Its last two qualifiers are at home,
against Montenegro on Oct. 11 and Poland four days later.  Montenegro leads Group H with 14 points from six games.
England is second with 12 points.  Ireland, Austria and Sweden are tied on eight points in
their qualifying group, which is led by Germany on 16 points.  Lukas Podolski and Lars Bender both scored twice in the
opening 24 minutes as Germany beat Ecuador 4-2 in the opener of
their two-match tour to the U.S. in Boca Raton, Florida.  The Germans next face the U.S. national team, which is
coached by former  Germany  striker Juergen Klinsmann, on June 2
at RFK Stadium in Washington.  To contact the reporter on this story:
