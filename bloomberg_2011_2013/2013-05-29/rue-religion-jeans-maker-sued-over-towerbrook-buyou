True Religion Apparel Inc. (TRLG) , the maker
of designer jeans worn by Megan Fox and Angelina Jolie, was sued
by an investor who contended the shares are undervalued in an
$835 million buyout by TowerBrook Capital Partners.  The company’s directors are duty-bound to obtain the
highest possible price for the stock and violated that duty by
agreeing to sell too low, the investor, Maxine Phillips, said in
a Delaware Chancery Court complaint filed yesterday in
Wilmington.  “The $32 per share consideration being offered” is
“unfair and inadequate in light of the fact that True Religion
has tremendous future growth prospects,” she said in the
filing.  True Religion, based in Vernon,  California , announced the
deal May 10 and said the bid by TowerBrook, a New York-based
private-equity firm, represented a 52 percent premium over the
share price on Oct. 9, just before the company said it was
exploring “strategic alternatives.”  Phillips asked the court to stop the deal under its present
terms and to award damages and legal fees.  “The company declines to comment on ongoing litigation,”
Alyssa Cass, a spokeswoman for True Religion, said in an
interview.  The agreement “provides our shareholders with immediate
and substantial cash value representing a significant premium,”
Seth Johnson, lead director of True Religion, said in a May 10
statement announcing the deal.  The case is Phillips v. Maron, 8598, Delaware Chancery
Court (Wilmington).  To contact the reporters on this story:
