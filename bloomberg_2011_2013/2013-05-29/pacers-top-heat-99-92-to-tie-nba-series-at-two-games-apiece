Roy Hibbert  had 23 points and 12
rebounds to lead the Indiana Pacers to a 99-92 win against the
defending champion Miami Heat and tie their National Basketball
Association playoff series at two games apiece.  The Heat host the Pacers for Game 5 tomorrow in their best-of-seven series. The Eastern Conference champions will meet the
San Antonio Spurs in the league’s championship series beginning
June 6.  The Pacers started the game with an 11-0 run before  LeBron James  hit two free throws to put the Heat on the board at
Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis. Indiana ended the first
quarter ahead 26-22 and had a 48-47 advantage at the half.  “When we come out to play like that, we’re unstoppable,”
Hibbert said in a televised interview. “We’re not going
anywhere. We’re going down to Miami to fight there.”  The Heat came within two points of the Pacers, 94-92, on
James’s 3-pointer with one minute, 20 seconds left in the game.
Twenty-four seconds later, James fouled out for the first time
since last year’s playoffs and the Heat failed to add another
point as the Pacers expanded their lead.  Lance Stephenson scored 20 points and  George Hill  added 19
for the Pacers, who shot 50 percent from the field compared with
39 percent for the Heat. Indiana outrebounded Miami 49-30.  James led the Heat with 24 points and  Mario Chalmers  had 20
points.  Chris Bosh  left the game in the third quarter with an
ankle injury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
