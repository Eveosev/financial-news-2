Egypt , the second-most indebted Arab
country, sold $2.7 billion of 4.25 percent euro notes to help
finance the  Middle East ’s highest budget deficit.  The debt was issued yesterday for trading on the regulated
Main Securities Market of the Irish Stock Exchange, the  Finance
Ministry  said in an e-mailed statement.  HSBC (HSBA)  and QNB Capital
managed the sale of the notes due in November 2014, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The sale was part of the country’s $12-billion Euro Medium-Term Note Program which will be “used to finance a portion” of
the country’s deficit in any given fiscal year, the ministry
said. The budget gap may widen to as much as 11.7 percent of
economic output, in the year that ends next month, former
Finance Minister El-Morsy Hegazi said in April.  Qatar pledged $3 billion on April 10 to support the ailing
Egyptian economy, taking the total aid provided by the Persian
Gulf nation to $8 billion. The funds were to be used to buy
bonds and had been finalized, Egyptian presidential spokesman
Omar Amer said April 30.  Finance Ministry  officials weren’t
available to comment on whether the bond sale was part of the
Qatar aid package.  To contact the reporter on this story:
