Trina Solar Ltd. (TSL) , China’s third-largest panel manufacturer, fell the most in a week as declining
prices led to a first-quarter loss that exceeded expectations.  The company’s American depositary receipts, each worth 50
ordinary shares, fell 11 percent to $6.04 at the close in  New
York , the most since May 22.  Trina’s net loss more than doubled from a year earlier to
$63.7 million, or 90 cents an ADR, Changzhou, China-based Trina
said today in a statement. That was 21 cents more than the
average of 12 analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
slumped 26 percent to $260.2 million.  Shipments increased 3.4 percent to 393 megawatts of panels
and the company said in the statement the “average selling
price of modules continued to decline in the first quarter.”  Trina didn’t provide its sales price. The industry average
price fell 19 percent from a year earlier to 79 cents a watt,
according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  Trina expects to ship 500 megawatts to 530 megawatts of
panels in the current quarter and 2 gigawatts to 2.1 gigawatts
this year.  Yingli Green Energy Holding Co. is  China ’s largest panel
manufacturer by shipments, followed by Suntech Power Holdings
Co.  To contact the reporter on this story:
