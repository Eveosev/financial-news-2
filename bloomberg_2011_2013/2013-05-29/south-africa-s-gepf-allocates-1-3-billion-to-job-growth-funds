South Africa ’s Government Employees
Pension Fund,  Africa ’s biggest, said it allocated 13 billion
rand ($1.3 billion) to three new funds targeted at boosting
employment and economic growth.  The Public Investment Corp., which manages most of the
GEPF’s money, committed 5 billion rand to an environmental
sustainability fund, 3 billion rand for a “priority sectors”
fund and 5 billion rand for a private-equity fund, the Pretoria-based GEPF said in an e-mailed statement today. The
environmental fund will invest in renewable energy and create
about 3,000 jobs, while the priority sectors fund will target
employment in manufacturing, agriculture, tourism and mining.  “It is prudent to invest in projects that contribute to
economic growth and job creation,” John Oliphant, the GEPF’s
principal officer, said in the statement.  The government’s pension fund, which manages more than 1
trillion rand, plans to invest 5 percent of its assets, or about
60 billion rand, in projects that aim to sustainably develop the
country while also providing financial returns. The GEPF and the
PIC also aim to invest in other African countries. Last year,
the PIC invested $250 million in Togolese lender  Ecobank
Transnational Inc. (ETI) , Africa’s most geographically diverse bank.  While the new private equity fund will concentrate on
medium-to-large capital buyouts and mergers and acquisitions in
South Africa, the GEPF said it also wants to start an
infrastructure fund and a private equity fund for the rest of
Africa before the end of the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
