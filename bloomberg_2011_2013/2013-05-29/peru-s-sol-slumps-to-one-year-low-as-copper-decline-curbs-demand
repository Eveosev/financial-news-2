Peru ’s sol dropped to its weakest
level in a year as slower Chinese growth damped the outlook for
the Andean nation’s copper exports.  The currency slid 0.8 percent to 2.7010 per U.S. dollar at
today’s close, the weakest since June 4, 2012, according to
prices from Datatec.  Copper fell after the  International Monetary Fund  cuts its
2013 growth forecast for China, the biggest buyer of industrial
metals, to 7.75 percent, compared with its April projection of 8
percent. Lower prices for copper and gold, Peru’s top exports,
will reduce the country’s trade surplus this year to the
narrowest since 2002, the  Finance Ministry  said yesterday.  “A smaller surplus is consistent with a weaker currency,”
said  Hugo Perea , chief economist at BBVA Banco Continental, by
phone from Lima.  The squeeze on dollar supply as local companies reduce
their sol holdings may lead the central bank to intervene to
stem further weakness in the local currency, said Antonio Diaz,
a trader at Banco Internacional del Peru in Lima.  “Someone has to provide liquidity and the central bank may
be the one to provide it,” Diaz said.  The central bank said on its website it didn’t sell dollars
today.  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 rose one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
4.24 percent at 1:57 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
