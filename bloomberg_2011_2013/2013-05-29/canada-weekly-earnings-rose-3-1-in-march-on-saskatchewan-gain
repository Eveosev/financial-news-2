Canadian average  weekly earnings  of

led provinces in wage gains, reporting a 5.5 percent year-over-year increase in March. Alberta was the only other province to
report wage gains above the national average, according to the
report. Wages in Ontario, Canada’s most-populous province, rose
at the national average 3.1 percent.  The average length of the workweek increased in March to
33.0 hours, from 32.9 hours a year earlier, Statistics Canada
