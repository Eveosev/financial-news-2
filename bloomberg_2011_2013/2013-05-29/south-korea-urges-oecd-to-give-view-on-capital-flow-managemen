 South Korea Finance Minister Hyun Oh
Seok comments in speech prepared for OECD meeting in Paris
*“Last November, the IMF recognized the legitimacy of the
capital flow management policies, saying that the capital
control measure is also an important policy tool”: Hyun
*“I believe it is now time for the OECD to give its opinion
with authority on this issue. As an institution that has led
important issues of the world economy, it seems already one
tempo behind in reviewing this global challenge": Hyun
*‘‘I ask that the OECD present its views regarding capital flow
management and global capital flows reflecting such
environmental changes at next year’s council meeting": Hyun  To contact the reporter on this story:
