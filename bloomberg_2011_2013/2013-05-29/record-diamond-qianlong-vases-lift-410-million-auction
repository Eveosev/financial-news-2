The biggest briolette-style diamond ever sold at auction, Qianlong period vases and a painting by the modern Chinese artist  Zhang Daqian  helped lift  Christie’s International (CHRS) ’s Hong Kong spring sales.  The five days of events that ended last night raised HK$3.2 billion ($418 million), the auction house said in an e-mailed release today. The sales showed the continued buying power of Asian clients, even as  China ’s expansion is slowing from the pace that turned it into the world’s No. 2 economy.  “The market has most definitely recovered since last year,” said  William Qian , a London-based dealer of ceramics who bid unsuccessfully for a Qianlong (1736-1795) blue and white Sanskrit-inscribed bell that sold for HK$15.6 million, 12 times its high estimate of HK$1.2 million.  The bell was part of a sale from the estate of Y.C. Chen, one of the most respected dealers of Chinese art in which all 68 lots sold, including the most expensive, a pair of iron-red Qianlong famille rose vases for HK$43.6 million yesterday.  The highlight of the May 28 jewelry sale was the 75.36-carat, water-drop-shaped diamond necklace that sold for an auction record of HK$86.1 million for a briolette-style gem. The Type IIa diamond is known for its exceptional transparency, according to the Christie’s catalog.  Zhang Daqian  A set of four hanging scrolls of ink and color on paper by Zhang (1899-1983) entitled “Lotus” was the top lot in the Chinese modern paintings sale, selling for HK$80.5 million with fees, more than five times its high estimate of HK$15 million at hammer prices.  A number of artist records were set during the Asian contemporary sale, though none by mainland Chinese artists. The results reflected how collectors are looking increasingly to southeast  Asia , dealers said.  “Still Life With Tropical Fruits” by Singaporean Georgette Chen fetched HK$5.05 million, while a 1932 ink and gouache on silk work by Nguyen Phan Chanh entitled “La Marchande de Riz,” which was originally appraised at just 50 pounds ($75) set a record for a Vietnamese artist by selling for HK$3.03 million.
