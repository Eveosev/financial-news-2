Orange-juice  futures climbed to a 13-month high on speculation that supplies will be disrupted during
 hurricane season , which begins this week.  This month, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  affirmed
that Florida’s orange crop will be 138 million boxes, 10 percent
less than first projected in October because of drought and a
crop disease. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to
November 30. Brazil is the world’s top orange grower, followed
by Florida. A box weighs 90 pounds, or 41 kilograms.  “This time of year, right before June 1 when hurricane
season comes around, you see a lot of speculators jump into the
market speculating on whether a hurricane is going to hit
Florida or not,”  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures &
Options in Port St. Lucie, Florida, said in a telephone
interview.  Orange juice for July delivery climbed 3.2 percent to
settle at $1.536 a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New
York, after reaching $1.546, the highest for a most-active
contract since April 9, 2012.  Storm Barbara grew into a hurricane with top winds of 75
miles (121 kilometers) per hour as it approached Mexico’s
Pacific Coast near Salina Cruz today. Barbara was moving north-northeast at 10 mph about 65 miles east-southeast of Salina
Cruz, the center said in an  advisory  at 11 a.m. Pacific time.
The system is expected to weaken rapidly as it moves toward the
 Gulf of Mexico .  To contact the reporter on this story:
