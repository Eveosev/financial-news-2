Croatia ’s economy contracted for a
sixth quarter as the euro region’s record recession prompted
further declines in personal consumption and investment.  Gross domestic product  fell 1.5 percent from a year earlier
between January and March compared with a 2.3 percent drop in
the previous three months, the  statistics office  in the capital,
Zagreb, said today in a preliminary estimate. The median
forecast of four economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a 1.6
percent contraction.  Croatia, which joins the European Union on July 1, hasn’t
posted economic growth since 2008, with foreign direct
investment slumping last year to almost a fifth of 2008’s $4.2
billion. The nation is counting on 10 billion euros ($13
billion) in EU funds through 2020 to reignite expansion through
infrastructure and tourism investments.  “A slower fall in industrial production and personal
consumption contributed to a softer decline in GDP,” Alen
Kovac, chief economist at the Croatian unit of  Erste Group Bank
AG (EBS) , said by phone.  The yield on Croatia’s dollar-denominated bond maturing
July 2020 climbed to 4.743 percent at 11:08 a.m. in Zagreb, the
highest since April 18. The cost of insuring the debt with five-year credit-default swaps, which rises as perceptions of
creditworthiness worsen, advanced to 296 basis points from 295
yesterday.  The economy will grow 0.7 percent this year after shrinking
2 percent in 2012, the  government  predicts. The European
Commission said May 3 that GDP will drop 1 percent in 2013 as
domestic demand continues to ebb, while net exports will provide
“limited support” in 2014, when the economy will expand by 0.2
percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
