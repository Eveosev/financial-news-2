Japanese stock futures dropped,
signaling equities are poised to snap a two-day rally, after the
yen gained, damping the earnings prospects for exporters.
Australian equity futures slid as crude oil fell.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , a
Japanese carmaker that gets 75 percent of its sales abroad,
declined 2.5 percent from the closing share price in Tokyo. ADRs
of  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , Australia’s largest mining company and oil
producer, slid 1.5 percent as crude fell.  Futures on Japan’s Nikkei 225 Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 13,985 in Chicago yesterday, compared with 14,200
in Osaka, Japan. They were bid in the pre-market at  13,970 in
Osaka at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index dropped 0.4 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index
was little changed in Wellington.  “Apart from volatility caused by the currency and bonds,
we are at a juncture where further moves from Japanese equities
need to be fundamentally driven,” said  Angus Gluskie , managing
director at White Funds Management in Sydney, who manages more
than $400 million. “It’s difficult for the market to keep
rallying.”  Traders of Japanese  government bonds  want the central bank
to buy more short-term notes and to conduct purchases more
frequently, according to Bank of Japan officials after a meeting
with market participants. The BOJ is trying to steady a debt
market where volatility has risen to the highest in four years
due to unprecedented monetary easing steps last month.  Yen Strengthens  The yen rose against 15 of its 16 major counterparts
yesterday. A stronger yen cuts the value of overseas earnings at
Japanese companies when repatriated.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.1 percent
today. The  index  dropped 0.7 percent in New York yesterday amid
concern that the  Federal Reserve  could begin to taper its debt-buying program as the economy continues to improve.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 6.6 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a 16 percent rally by the  S&P
500  and an 8.2 percent advance by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  West Texas Intermediate crude for July delivery slid $1.88
to $93.13 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the
lowest settlement since May 1.  The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of the most-traded
Chinese stocks in the U.S. sank 1.6 percent to 91.57 yesterday,
the lowest close in a month. Futures on Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng (2828) 
Index dropped 0.5 percent and contracts on the Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index of mainland companies trading in  Hong Kong 
declined 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
