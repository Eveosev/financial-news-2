Indonesia’s rupiah fell to the
weakest level since September 2009 on speculation an improving
 U.S. economy  increases the chance the  Federal Reserve  will scale
back stimulus that’s spurred inflows to  emerging markets .  The Dollar Index rose for a second day after data yesterday
showed U.S.  consumer confidence  is at a five-year high, while
the yield on 10-year Treasuries climbed 48 basis points this
month. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week that its $85
billion a month of bond buying may be cut if the U.S. economy
shows signs of sustained improvement. Indonesian companies
usually pay dividends toward the end of the second quarter.  “What we’re experiencing now is a round of dollar buying
that’s prompted by the rise in U.S. yields, as there’s been
expectations for when the Fed could withdraw liquidity from the
marketplace,” said Thio Chin Loo, a senior currency analyst at
BNP Paribas SA in Singapore. The repatriation of equity
dividends could also be a factor, she said.  The rupiah weakened 0.9 percent to 9,885 per dollar as of
9:33 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. It touched 9,890, the weakest level since Sept.
15, 2009. The spot rate traded at a 0.8 percent premium to the
one-month non-deliverable forwards, which declined 0.4 percent
to 9,963 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Overseas investors sold $148 million more Indonesian shares
than they bought in the first two days of the week, exchange
data show. The rupiah has weakened 1.6 percent against the
greenback this month, poised for the biggest decline in a year.  Bonds Fall  Bank Indonesia  is committed to maintaining the currency’s
stability in line with economic fundamentals, Deputy Governor
Perry Warjiyo said on May 22.  One-month implied volatility in the rupiah, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options,
dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to 7.23
percent.  The yield on the government’s benchmark 10-year bonds rose
five basis points to 5.91 percent. The yield has advanced 41
basis points this month, the most since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
