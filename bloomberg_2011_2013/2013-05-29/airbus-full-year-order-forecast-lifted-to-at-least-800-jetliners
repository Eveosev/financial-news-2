Airbus SAS (EAD)  will “comfortably” accrue
more than 800 plane orders this year, up from a prior estimate
of at least 750, parent European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co.
said today at its annual shareholder meeting in Amsterdam.  The estimate from EADS Chief Executive Officer  Tom Enders 
comes after Airbus booked 514 firm orders in the first four
months, with others announced but yet to be finalized. The
Toulouse-based planemaker began 2013 forecasting 700 new
contracts before lifting the target by 50 planes in April.  The backlog is likely to be swollen further at next month’s
 Paris Air Show , with Airbus announcing around 40 percent of its
annual order total at the French expo or its U.K. counterpart,
according to a note from Morgan Stanley analyst Rupinder Vig.  To contact the reporter on this story:
