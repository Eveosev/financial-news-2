Liquefied natural gas prices for
delivery to Northeast Asia dropped this week on “subdued”
summer demand even as a disruption to Nigerian exports tightened
supplies, according to Energy Intelligence Group.  Spot cargoes for delivery over the next four to eight weeks
were at $14.30 per million British thermal units, down from
$14.35 per million Btu in the period ended May 20, the research
company said on the website of its World Gas Intelligence
publication. The price in Southwest Europe was unchanged at
$11.50 from last week, according to WGI.  Asian LNG buyers typically pay more in the months before
and during the northern-hemisphere summer from June through
August as demand for air conditioning increases the region’s
power requirements.  Nigeria LNG Ltd.,  Africa ’s largest exporter of the fuel,
said it declared force majeure this month after  Royal Dutch
Shell Plc (RDSA)  discovered a pipeline leak and halted deliveries.
Force majeure is a legal clause that protects a company from
liability when it can’t fulfill a contract for reasons beyond
its control.  Shell shut its Gbaran Ubie and Soku gas facility after the
pipeline leak cut supplies by half, Kudo Eresia-Eke, an Abuja-based spokesman for Nigeria LNG, said May 17 in an e-mail.  To contact the reporter on this story:
