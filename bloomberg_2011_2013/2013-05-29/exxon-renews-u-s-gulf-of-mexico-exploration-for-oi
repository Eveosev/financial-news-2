Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
largest energy company by market value, is boosting exploration
for oil in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico five years after dismissing
the region as too costly.  Technological breakthroughs in seismic imaging have enabled
Exxon’s geologists and engineers to more thoroughly assess
subsea crude deposits that previously eluded them in the deepest
parts of the Gulf, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer  Rex Tillerson  said in a meeting with reporters in Dallas today.  “We’ve re-entered in a very active way the Gulf of
Mexico,” Tillerson said. His comments followed the Irving,
Texas-based company’s annual shareholders meeting.  In March 2008, Tillerson said the discoveries being made in
the Gulf weren’t large enough to justify the costs of erecting
production platforms and installing pipelines. Energy explorers
needed to “cobble together” individual discoveries to make
pumping oil and natural gas to the surface profitable, he said
at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
