Former Federal Reserve Chairman  Paul
Volcker  said today a central bank’s responsibility is for a
“stable currency.”  “The word stable is pretty good one,” Volcker told the
 Economic Club of New York .  Volcker said the Fed setting an inflation target “implies
a degree of accuracy in what we can actually achieve or should
achieve.”  Prices will move “when the economy goes up or down,”
Volcker said. “Different indexes will give you different
readings.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
