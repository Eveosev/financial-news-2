Larry King, a former  CNN  talk-show
host, will join Kremlin-backed RT television, a year after
Wikileaks founder Julian Assange debuted on the Russian network.  RT, formerly known as Russia Today, will start airing the
weekly “Politics with Larry King” next month, the network said
in a statement on its  website  today. RT will also broadcast
“Larry King Now,” which debuted on Ora.tv and Hulu LLC last
year, four times a week.  The programs will be recorded at RT’s studio in  Washington 
and Ora.tv’s studio in Los Angeles, according to the statement.
RT will have exclusive U.S. broadcast rights for both shows.
Ora.tv is backed by Mexican billionaire  Carlos Slim ’s wireless
carrier America Movil SAB.  King, 79, was a Miami media personality who gained
nationwide fame with a radio show from 1978 to 1994, according
to a biography on the website of CNN, the 24-hour news network
owned by Time Warner Inc. “Larry King Live” first aired on CNN
in 1985 and became the network’s highest-rated program, mixing
interviews with political figures such as presidents Vladimir Putin and  Barack Obama  and celebrities including George Clooney.
King gave up that show in 2010.  RT broadcasts 24 hours a day in English, Spanish and Arabic
and claims 630 million viewers globally. Assange aired his 12-part interview show on the network last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
