GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  acquired Okairos
AG, a Swiss developer of vaccine technologies, for 250 million
euros ($324 million) to expand its range of inoculations.  The all-cash purchase also includes early-stage products
targeting respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus,
malaria, tuberculosis, ebola and HIV, London-based Glaxo said in
a  statement  today. The experimental vaccines for malaria and
hepatitis C are in the second of three stages of testing usually
required for regulatory approval.  Okairos uses viruses to deliver genetic material into
cells, stimulating the immune system. The technology has been
tested in more than 700 people, according to the statement.
Glaxo, the U.K.’s biggest drugmaker, said it plans to use the
technology from closely held Okairos to produce vaccines that
both prevent infections and fight diseases such as cancer.  Glaxo already sells vaccines, including against influenza,
hepatitis and rotavirus, and has been developing an inoculation
for malaria. The company’s vaccine business generated 3.3
billion pounds ($5 billion) in  revenue  last year.  Okairos’s investors include BioMedInvest, the Boehringer
Ingelheim Venture Fund, LSP, Novartis Venture Funds and Versant
Ventures, according to its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
