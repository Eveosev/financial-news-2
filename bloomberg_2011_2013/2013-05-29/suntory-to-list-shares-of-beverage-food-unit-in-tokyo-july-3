Suntory Holdings Ltd. is poised to
raise as much as 476 billion yen ($4.7 billion) by listing
shares of its non-alcoholic beverage business in what would be
 Japan ’s largest initial public offering this year.  The company has set a tentative IPO price of 3,800 yen a
share for the July 3 Tokyo listing, according to a filing
yesterday with Japan’s Finance Ministry. The Suntory Beverage &
Food unit may sell as many as 125.2 million shares including
over allotment, according to Bloomberg calculations based on the
filing.  The Osaka-based drinks maker as well as Japanese rivals
such as  Asahi Group Holdings Ltd. (2502)  and Kirin Holdings Co. have
sought growth through overseas deals as a declining population
damps domestic demand. Suntory Holdings has been exploring ways
to fund deals and has set up a department within the listing
unit to explore mergers and acquisitions.  “Suntory has become a very strong competitor now that it’s
listing and can raise more money for acquisitions,” said
Mikihiko Yamato, deputy head of research for JI Asia in  Tokyo .
“Some investors may move funds from Kirin, Asahi to Suntory.”  The IPO would be the largest in the North Asian country
since Japan Airlines Co.’s 663 billion yen offering in
September, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It will set
a price range on June 17 with final pricing expected on June 24.  Kirin shares fell as much as 2.9 percent to 1,672, headed
for the lowest close since April 23. Asahi dropped as much as
2.6 percent.  IPO Appetite  A financial-market rally is fueling appetite for share
sales in Japan. The benchmark Topix Index has climbed 62 percent
over the past 12 months on the back of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policies to stimulate the world’s third-largest economy.  Nomura, Japan’s biggest brokerage, said in January that it
expects IPOs will climb to a six-year high. About 60 Japanese
companies will announce debut share sales this year, a 25
percent increase from last year and the most since 121 in 2007,
according to the Tokyo-based bank.  The IPO proceeds will be used for investments including
acquisitions to strengthen operations in developed and  emerging
markets , according to the company’s prospectus.  About 350 billion yen of the proceeds will be used for
Suntory Beverage, and the remaining of about 120 billion yen
will be used for Suntory Holdings, which will stay unlisted,
said Midori Takahashi, a spokeswoman for the company.  Acquisitions  The closely held Japanese whiskey and beer maker is known
for its motto ’Yatteminahare’ or “go for it,” the slogan
created by its founder Shinjiro Torii. As Japan’s second-biggest
drinks maker, it has focused overseas  acquisitions  on non-alcohol beverages over the past five years.  The company bought France-based Orangina Schweppes Group
for 300 billion yen in 2009 and paid 600 million euros in 2009
for New Zealand’s Frucor Beverages Group Ltd.  Industry shipments of beer, low-malt beer, and beer-like
drinks in Japan last year fell 1 percent to 438 million cases as
demand fell for an eighth straight year.  Suntory Beverage, which accounted for about 60 percent of
the parent’s operating profit in 2011, plans to double its sales
to 2 trillion yen by 2020, it said in December. It had 992
billion yen of sales in 2012, an increase of 11 percent from a
year earlier, while Suntory Holdings had 1.85 trillion yen,
according to yesterday’s filing.  Suntory Holdings had 20 percent market share in Japan’s
non-alcoholic drink market in 2012, the second biggest after
Coca-Cola Co.’s 28 percent, according to researcher Inryosoken.  The IPO comes after merger talks between Suntory and Kirin
Holdings Co. failed in 2010 due to differing opinions on the
merger ratio.  Emerging Markets  Suntory Beverage plans to expand overseas through
acquisitions in emerging markets such as Southeast Asia, Middle
East,  Africa  and Latin America, it said in December in its mid-term plan from 2013 to 2015.  Net income at Suntory Holdings will increase 45 percent to
53 billion yen for the year ending Dec. 31, the company forecast
in February. Revenue is projected to rise 9.1 percent to 2.02
trillion yen.  Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604) , Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. were selected to manage Suntory Beverage’s listing, the
company said. Suntory Holdings will hold 59.5 percent of the
listing unit, said Takahashi, a spokeswoman for the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
