Defence Secretary Philip Hammond said
the U.K. is detaining as many as 90 Afghans without charge in a
holding facility in Camp Bastion, while denying as “absurd”
suggestions that Parliament had not been informed.  British lawyers acting for eight of the men told the  BBC 
they had been held for as long as 14 months without charge and
said their detention may be unlawful. Hammond, speaking to the
BBC’s “Today” radio program, blamed the Afghan legal system
for delays in transferring suspects to local authorities.  The lawyers compared the case to the detention of terrorism
suspects by the U.S. at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba. Hammond said the
release of the detainees at Camp Bastion, in southern
 Afghanistan , would put British troops at risk.  “We would like nothing more than to be able to hand these
people over to the Afghan authorities so they can go through the
Afghan judicial system,” Hammond said. “These are people
suspected of murdering British troops, of facilitating or
planting or being involved with IEDs,” he said, referring to
improvised explosive devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
