Brazil ’s Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  said he’s not concerned about the real’s recent weakness
and that the government won’t use the  exchange rate  to tame
inflation.  “Other tools exist to combat inflation,” he said in
Brasilia. “This is an international shift and there’s no reason
we should be different.”  Mantega, speaking to reporters after a report today showed
economic growth unexpectedly slowed during the first quarter,
said a weaker real can boost exports.  The real has weakened more than 4 percent against the
dollar in the past month, the fastest decline among seven major
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The real
extended losses after Mantega’s comment, declining 0.8 percent
to 2.0915 as of 12:07 p.m. local time.  A weaker real, which can raise the cost of imports, may add
to inflation pressures after the pace of consumer price
increases exceeded the 6.5 percent upper limit of the
government’s target range in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
