Malaysia ’s ringgit dropped by the
most in four months and bonds fell as concern the Federal
Reserve will pare its stimulus reduced demand for emerging-market assets.  The ringgit declined 0.7 percent to 3.0658 per dollar as of
2:18 p.m. in Kuala Lumpur, the biggest loss since Jan. 31,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 3.0672, the
weakest level since April 5. The yield on the 3.26 percent
government notes due March 2018 rose nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 3.27 percent. The rate climbed 12 basis
points in May.  U.S. data yesterday showed  consumer confidence  rose to the
highest in more than five years, raising speculation a recovery
in the world’s largest economy is gathering steam. Fed Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said last week the central bank may cut back its
bond-buying program if there are signs of a sustainable
improvement. Reports this month showed Malaysia’s factory
production and exports contracted in March, while first-quarter
growth was the slowest since the period ended September 2009.  “The better U.S. data is pushing the U.S. dollar higher
because it’s increasing expectations the Fed may start to taper
its bond purchases,” said  Jonathan Cavenagh , a strategist at
Westpac Banking Corp. in  Singapore .  The ringgit is under pressure because of the risk overseas
investors will pull funds from the nation’s bond market.
Government notes returned 0.5 percent this month, the second-best performance among 10 Asian debt indexes compiled by HSBC
Holdings Plc.  The currency lost 0.8 percent in May, set for its worst
month since January. One-month non-deliverable forwards dropped
0.8 percent to 3.0723 per dollar and touched 3.0745, the lowest
level since April 5, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
contracts traded 0.2 percent weaker than the spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
