Bank of America Corp. cut its Brent
crude price estimates amid lower-than-expected fuel demand in
 China  and  Europe  and rising oil production in  North America .  Brent, the benchmark for more than half the world’s oil,
will trade at an average $103 a barrel in the second half of
this year, according to Francisco Blanch, the bank’s head of
commodities research in  New York , lowering the bank’s forecast
from $111. The 2014 Brent estimate was cut to $105 from $112, he
wrote in a report dated yesterday.  “The combination of lower demand and higher supply could
tilt the market into a small surplus over the next 18-to-24
months,” Blanch said.  Bank of America left its estimates for West Texas
Intermediate unchanged at $91 a barrel for the second half of
2013 and $92 for 2014. Front-month Brent futures traded at about
$103.89 at 12:17 p.m. London time. WTI was at $94.41.  The bank reduced its 2013 global oil-demand growth estimate
to 800,000 barrels a day from 950,000 barrels because of weaker-than expected consumption in China and Europe. The 2014 growth
forecast was cut down to 1.2 million, mostly due to expectations
for slower growth in  emerging markets . U.S. output has exceeded
“optimistic” estimates by as much as 500,000 barrels a day in
the fourth quarter of 2012 and the first three months of this
year amid rising shale oil production, Blanch said.  “Unless regulatory constraints to export crude oil are
removed, WTI crude prices should remain soft, and we still see a
risk of $50 a barrel for the Oklahoma grade at some point over
the next 24 months on the back of midstream and downstream
bottlenecks,” the bank said.  There is a growing possibility that Brent will move into a
range of $90-$100 a barrel after 2014 as “we now see less of a
structural oil market deficit on softer emerging market activity
and the rise in non-conventional oil supplies,” according to
the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
