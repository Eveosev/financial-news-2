Centum Investment Co.,  Kenya ’s
largest publicly traded investment group, headed for the highest
close in almost three years on investor bets that net income for
the 12 months through March advanced.  The stock climbed for the second day, jumping 4.6 percent
to 23 shillings at 1:50 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, the
highest level on a closing basis since September 2010. About
301,600 shares traded, or 104 percent of the three-month daily
average, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “They are expected to announce their earnings soon and we
definitely expect a growth in profit because equities have been
performing very well,” Faith Atiti, a research analyst at
Nairobi-based NIC Securities Ltd., said by phone.  Shares of the company that invests in banks, breweries and
 food processing  have surged 86 percent this year, making it the
third-best performer on the benchmark  Nairobi Securities
Exchange All-Share Index (NSEASI) , which gained 34 percent in the period.
The index is the eighth-best performer globally in 2013 among 94
gauges tracked by Bloomberg.  Centum will probably report results on June 18, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Net income  dropped 48 percent to
1.19 billion shillings ($14 million) last year after rising the
previous two years, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
