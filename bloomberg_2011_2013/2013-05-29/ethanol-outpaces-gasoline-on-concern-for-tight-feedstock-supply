Ethanol outperformed gasoline on
speculation that tighter corn supplies before the fall harvest
will temper fuel production, which is already below-average for
this time of year.  The spread, or price difference, narrowed 11.27 cents to
10.81 cents a gallon as the most recent Energy Information
Administration report on May 22 showed  stockpiles  at the lowest
since November 2010 and  production  down 4.8 percent from a year
earlier.  U.S. corn stockpiles in the year ending Aug. 31 will be 23
percent below year-earlier levels after the worst drought since
the 1930s cut output, Agriculture Department estimates show.  “On the back of traders’ minds is tight corn supplies
coupled with plants that have already planned shutdowns for July
and August that cannot be undone,” said Justin Dirico, manager
of the biofuels desk at Eagle Energy Brokers LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for June delivery climbed 6.3 cents, or
2.4 percent, to $2.695 a gallon on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
Futures have gained 32 percent in the past year.  Gasoline for June delivery fell 4.97 cents, or 1.7 percent,
to $2.8031 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  One bushel of corn makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.
Producers of the biofuel across the Midwest tempered output and
idled supply after last summer’s drought devastated crops and
wiped out returns to manufacture the fuel.  Corn Crush  Corn for July delivery slipped 1.5 cents to $6.65 a bushel
in Chicago. The corn crush spread, or the cost difference
between a gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, was
about 13 cents, up from 8 cents yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Inventories were at 16.2 million barrels in the week ended
May 17, the lowest level since Nov. 5, 2010, the IEA, the Energy
Department’s analytical arm, said in a May 22 report.  Ethanol  production  in the week ended May 17 increased 2.1
percent to 875,000 barrels a day, according to EIA.  Corn-based ethanol RINs for 2013  rose 2 cents to 87 cents
at 5:08 p.m.  New York  time. Advanced RINs, which cover biodiesel
and Brazilian sugarcane-based ethanol, advanced 3 cents to 97.5
cents.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 3.5 cents
to $2.675 a gallon; in New York the additive gained 2.5 cents to
$2.755; on the West Coast the biofuel increased 1 cent to
$2.845, and in the U.S. Gulf prices climbed 0.5 cent to $2.775 a
gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 0.5
cent to 7 cents while Chicago’s discount to New York Harbor
narrowed 1 cent to 8 cents.  The U.S. hasn’t  imported  any of the fuel since April 19,
EIA data show.  Anhydrous ethanol in  Sao Paulo  cost $2.43 a gallon in the
week ended May 24, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
