Tele2 AB (TEL2B)  rose the most in two weeks
after Credit Suisse Group AG said prospects of improving mobile
profitability in Norway, higher  Kazakhstan  sales and stable
Swedish pricing mean the carrier’s investment case has improved.  The  shares  rose as much as 2.6 percent, the biggest
intraday increase since May 15, and were up 1.1 percent at 82.9
kronor at 10:53 a.m. in  Stockholm , valuing the operator, which
is based in the Swedish capital, at 37.8 billion kronor ($5.7
billion). The shares have fallen 4.5 percent this year.  “We believe Tele2 earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization can grow mid-single digits driven
by positive revenue growth,” Jakob Bluestone, an analyst at
Credit Suisse in  London , wrote in a note today. He raised his
rating on the share to outperform from underperform and
increased the price estimate by 39 percent to 100 kronor.  Bluestone said Tele2’s Norwegian margins could rise next
year as it comes out of its national roaming agreements and wins
market share. Sales from Kazakhstan should double over the next
two years, he added.  Tele2, which sold its Russian assets to VTB Group for $2.4
billion in equity and $1.15 billion in net debt in March, had 42
percent of its first-quarter sales from Sweden, its largest
market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
