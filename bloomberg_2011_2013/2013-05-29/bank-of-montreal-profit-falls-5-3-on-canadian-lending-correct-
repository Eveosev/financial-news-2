Bank of Montreal ,  Canada ’s fourth-biggest lender, posted second-quarter profit that missed
analysts’ expectations after taking charges tied to cost-cutting
and its takeover of Wisconsin lender Marshall & Ilsley Corp.  Net income for the period ended April 30 dropped 5.3
percent to C$975 million ($940 million), or C$1.42 a share, from
C$1.03 billion, or C$1.51, a year earlier, the Toronto-based
company said today in a statement. Revenue declined 0.4 percent
to C$3.94 billion.  Earnings fell after Bank of Montreal recorded C$50 million
of costs tied to its integration of M&I, which it bought in July
2011 for C$4.1 billion, and an C$82 million restructuring charge
tied to cost-cutting. The bank also faced lower earnings from
Canadian lending and insurance.  “We view the results as a noisy mess,”  Robert Sedran , an
analyst with  CIBC World Markets , said in a note. “The Canadian
personal and commercial-banking segment’s earnings and revenue
growth trailed peers so far this quarter.”  Adjusted earnings, which exclude some items, were C$1.46 a
share, the company said, missing the C$1.48  average estimate  of
15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Bank of Montreal joins
Toronto-Dominion Bank and  Bank of Nova Scotia (BNS)  in posting results
that missed estimates.  Shares Decline  Bank of Montreal  fell  2 percent to C$62.42 at 9:48 a.m. in
Toronto, its biggest intraday drop since June 1, 2012. The
shares have risen 2.5 percent this year, the third-best
performer on the  eight-company  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Commercial
Banks Index.  “Management’s focus on organizational efficiency is a
multiyear commitment,” Chief Executive Officer William Downe,
61, said in the statement. “Our first priority is sustainable
revenue growth -- and the disciplined management of expense is
an ongoing dimension of profitable growth.”  Canadian consumer-banking profit fell 0.7 percent to C$430
million from a year earlier on lower net interest margins and
higher expenses, the lender said. Profit from its Chicago-based
BMO Harris Bank consumer-lending unit rose 9.2 percent to C$155
million, the company said.  Slowing Lending  “The slowing in Canadian lending is something we’ve
expected,”  John Kinsey , who helps manage about C$1 billion at
Caldwell Securities Ltd. in Toronto, said in an interview. “For
some time all of the banks have said it’s going to be tough to
grow in Canada.”  Earnings from BMO Capital Markets, the lender’s investment-banking unit, climbed 18 percent to C$275 million. Profit from
the private-client group, which includes insurance and mutual
funds, fell 4.1 percent to C$141 million, the bank said.  The lender set aside C$145 million for bad loans, down from
C$195 million a year earlier.  Bank of Montreal is the fourth Canadian lender to report
second-quarter results.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY) , the country’s
largest lender, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the
fifth largest, release earnings tomorrow.  ( Bank of Montreal (BMO)  will hold a conference call to discuss
quarterly results at 2 p.m. Toronto time at +1-888-789-0089 or
