Silver may climb toward $25 an ounce
after prices rebounded from the lowest level since September
2010, according to technical analysis by Commerzbank AG.  Prices slumped last week to test the support area of $19.49
to $20 before rebounding in a bullish reversal, technical
analyst  Axel Rudolph  wrote in a report dated yesterday. That
support zone consists of the psychological $20 level, the May
2010 high and the December 2009 peak, he said.  Silver for immediate delivery dropped as much as 7 percent
to $20.6985 an ounce on May 20 before closing 2.9 percent higher
at $22.905. Prices ended last week at $22.398, higher than
previous week’s close of $22.25.  The reversal last week was accompanied by positive
divergence between the daily price and the relative-strength
index, he said. It “ leads us to believe that another up leg
should be made in the near future,” Rudolph wrote. This should
take silver back above its one-month resistance line at $23.25
and the $24.87 late-April high toward $25, he said.  A bullish reversal is when the price declines below the
previous low before closing higher than the prior week.
Resistance refers to an area on a chart where sell orders may be
gathered, and support is an area where there may be buy orders.
The relative-strength index measures the velocity of price
changes to identify overbought or oversold conditions and
turning points.  Silver slumped 27 percent this year, the biggest loss among
the 24 commodities in the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index, as
gold dropped 17 percent on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may
curb U.S. monetary stimulus.  Spot silver fell 0.3 percent to $22.2755 an ounce by 3:30
p.m. in  Singapore  today. In  technical analysis , investors and
