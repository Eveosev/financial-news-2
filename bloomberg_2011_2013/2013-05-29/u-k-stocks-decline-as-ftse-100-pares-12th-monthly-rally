U.K. stocks  fell, with the  FTSE 100
Index (UKX)  trimming its 12th straight monthly rally, as the
International Monetary Fund cut Chinese growth forecasts.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  followed a gauge of London-listed mining
shares lower. Kazakhmys Plc and Evraz Plc declined at least 3.5
percent after Stoxx Ltd. said the shares will be removed from
its Stoxx Europe 600 Index next month.  RusPetro Plc (RPO)  jumped 16
percent after saying it got a loan extension and interest-payment waivers from Sberbank of Russia.  The FTSE 100 Index slipped 78.97 points, or 1.2 percent, to
6,683.04 at 8:51 a.m. in London, paring its gains this month to
4 percent. The equity benchmark yesterday surged the most in
five weeks as U.S.  consumer confidence  and house prices
increased. The measure has advanced  13 percent  so far this year.
The broader FTSE All-Share Index lost 1.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index dropped 0.8 percent.  China will expand at a rate of 7.75 percent this year and
next, David Lipton, first deputy managing director of the IMF,
said after concluding an annual review of the world’s second-largest economy. In April, the IMF had forecast growth of 8
percent this year and 8.2 percent in 2014.  The volume of shares in FTSE 100-listed companies was 17
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
