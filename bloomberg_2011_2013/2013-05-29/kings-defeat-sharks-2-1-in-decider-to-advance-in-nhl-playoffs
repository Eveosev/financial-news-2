Justin Williams scored two goals as
the  Los Angeles Kings  eliminated the  San Jose Sharks  to reach
the conference finals of the National Hockey League playoffs.  The defending Stanley Cup champion Kings won 2-1 last night
in a decisive seventh game at Staples Center in Los Angeles.
Jonathan Quick had 26 saves for the home team.  “He made some awesome saves to preserve the lead,”
Williams said in a televised interview. “We got big goals when
we needed them.”  The Kings will play the  Chicago Blackhawks  or the  Detroit
Red Wings  for a place in the Stanley Cup finals. That series
will conclude tonight with the Blackhawks hosting Game 7.  Williams got the opening goal on a power play four minutes,
11 seconds into the second period and added a second goal three
minutes later.  The Sharks got a goal back through Dan Boyle 5:26 into the
third period.  “We made one more mistake than they did,” Sharks coach
Todd McLellan told reporters, “and we couldn’t get one more
puck past Quick.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
