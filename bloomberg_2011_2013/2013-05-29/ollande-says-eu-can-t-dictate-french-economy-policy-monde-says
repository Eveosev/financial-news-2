President Francois Hollande said the
European Commission isn’t in a position to decree French
economic policy,  Le Monde  reported.  The commission isn’t there to “dictate what we have to
do,” Hollande was quoted as saying by the newspaper. “We have
to respect our European commitments on deficit reduction,” he
said, according to the report. “As for structural reform, it’s
up to us and us alone to decide what path to take to obtain the
objective.”  The commission, the executive arm of the European Union,
today advised  France  to overhaul its pension system by raising
the retirement age. Hollande, who partially rolled back a
retirement-system reform when he won office a year ago, said
earlier this month that longer life expectancy would mean people
would have to work longer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
