Quantum Fuel Systems Technologies
Worldwide Inc. (QTWW) , the  Lake Forest , California-based developer of
alternative-fuel vehicles and energy-storage systems, agreed to
sell its 10-megawatt Trout Creek wind farm in Canada.  The buyer will pay about C$971,000 ($936,000) in cash and
assume approximately C$237,000 in liabilities for 75 percent of
the project in the first phase of the deal that’s expected to
close within six weeks, according to a statement today. The
buyer, who wasn’t identified, will pay C$1.1 million for the
remainder within 18 to 24 months after  Trout Creek  begins
commercial operations in southeast Ontario.  Quantum said in March it was planning to sell wind assets
from its Schneider Power unit for as much as $3.5 million.  “It remains our intent to complete the disposition of all
of Schneider Power’s operating assets and development projects
as soon as possible,” Chief Executive Officer Brian Olson said
in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
