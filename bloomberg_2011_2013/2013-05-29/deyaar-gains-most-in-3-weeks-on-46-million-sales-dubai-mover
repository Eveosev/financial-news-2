Deyaar Development PJSC (DEYAAR)  headed for
the biggest gain in three weeks after the Dubai-based builder of
residential and commercial property sold real estate valued at
170 million dirhams ($46 million).  The shares climbed 3.4 percent, set for the biggest advance
since May 9, to 42.4 fils at 1:36 p.m. in Dubai. The stock was
the second-most active on Dubai’s benchmark index, after  Arabtec
Holding Co. (ARTC) , with about 113 million shares traded, or four times
the three-month daily average. Arabtec, a construction company,
jumped 7.2 percent and Dubai’s benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI)  rose
0.8 percent.  Dubai, home to the world’s tallest tower, is embarking on
new developments including a district that includes the world’s
biggest shopping mall and a complex of five theme parks. The
emirate’s real-estate market is rebounding after property prices
plunged at the onset of the global credit crisis in 2008. The
recovery helped Deyaar more than double profit in the first
quarter. The company  reported  a 2.9 billion-dirham loss in 2010.  The announcement “is improving investors’ confidence in
the restructuring and recovery of the company,” said Marwan Shurrab, vice-president at Dubai-based Gulfmena Investments Ltd.  Arabtec shareholders on record by tomorrow are eligible for
a rights offer. “It’s trading today ex-rights issue, and that
removes selling pressure of investors that feared dilution,”
Shurrab said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
