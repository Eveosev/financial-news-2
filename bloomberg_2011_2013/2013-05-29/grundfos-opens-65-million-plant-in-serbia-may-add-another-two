Grundfos A/S, the world’s biggest
maker of circulator pumps, opened a new factory in  Serbia  and
may expand production with two more facilities to meet demand in
southeastern Europe.  The 26,000-square-meter plant in Indjija northwest of
Belgrade will employ 350 people by the end of 2014, more than
doubling Grundfos’ workforce in Serbia where it began production
in 2011, the Bjerringbro, Denmark-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
