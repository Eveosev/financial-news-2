Sinovel Wind Group Co. (601558) , China’s
third-biggest maker of wind turbines, said it’s being
investigated for suspected violations of securities laws and
regulations.  The company received a notice from China Securities
Regulatory Commission on the decision to start the probe, and
will cooperate, according to a filing to the  Shanghai Stock
Exchange  yesterday. The statement didn’t provide more details.  Sinovel, based in Beijing, in March revised down 2011
profit by 22 percent to 607.4 million yuan ($99.1 million) due
to an accounting error.  The turbine company also is embroiled in a legal dispute
with Devens, Massachusetts-based  American Superconductor Corp. (AMSC) ,
which is seeking more than $1.2 billion in damages in Chinese
courts from its former largest customer. AMSC accused Sinovel of
stealing its technology and violating sales contracts.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
