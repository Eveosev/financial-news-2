The Treasury’s sale of $35 billion of
five-year notes attracted the most interest from non-primary
dealer investors since at least 2003 as the highest yield in 13
months bolstered demand.  Indirect and direct bidders combined to win about 67
percent of yesterday’s offering, compared with an average of
about 57 percent at the 10 previous auctions. The notes were
sold at what is known as a high yield of 1.045 percent, the most
for the security at an auction since October 2011.  “Indirects and directs stepped up,” said William O’Donnell, head U.S. government bond strategist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut , one of 21 primary
dealers that are obligated to bid at U.S. government debt
auctions. “After a weak two-year auction yesterday, it looks
like we may have gone back far enough to attract some money into
the market.”  The Treasury’s $35 billion sale of two-year debt on May 28
attracted the fewest bids for the securities since February 2011.
The bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total
bids with the amount of securities offered, was 3.04, compared
with an average of 3.72 for the past 10 sales.  The current five-year note yield fell three basis points or
0.03 percentage point to 0.99 percent, according to Bloomberg
Bond Trader data. The 0.625 percent note due April 2018 rose 1/8,
or $1.25 per $1,000 face value, to 98 1/4.  Auction Details  At the five-year auction, the bid-to-cover ratio was 2.79,
compared with an average of 2.84 for the previous 10 sales. The
yield of 1.045 percent was below the 1.051 percent forecast by a
Bloomberg News survey of seven primary dealers before the
offering.  Primary dealers bought 32.6 percent of the notes, the least
since at least 2003. Indirect bidders, an investor class that
includes foreign central banks, purchased 44 percent of the
notes, compared with an average of 41.6 percent for the past 10
sales.  Direct bidders, non-primary dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 23.3 percent of
the notes, compared with an average of 15.1 percent at the last
10 auctions.  The U.S. will auction $29 billion of seven-year securities
today. The auctions, including Treasury Inflation-Protected
Securities offered last week, will raise $53.5 billion of new
cash, as maturing securities held by the public total $58.5
billion, according to the U.S. Treasury.  Investors have bid $2.99 for each dollar of the $876
billion in Treasury notes and bonds sold at auction so far this
year compared with a record bid-to-cover ratio of $3.15 set in
2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
