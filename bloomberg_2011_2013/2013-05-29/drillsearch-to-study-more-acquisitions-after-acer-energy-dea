Drillsearch Energy Ltd. (DLS) ,  BG Group
Plc (BG/) ’s shale gas exploration partner in central Australia, will
consider further acquisitions in the region after its purchase
last year of Acer Energy Ltd.  Drillsearch, which acquired the rest of Acer in a deal that
valued the Brisbane-based company at A$132 million ($126
million), is studying more purchases in the Cooper Basin to
complement its holdings in the area, Managing Director Brad Lingo said yesterday in an interview at a conference in Brisbane.  “It would be clearly focused on adding reserves, adding
production and adding  cash flow , and focused around quality
development,” he said, declining to identify any assets.
“There are from time to time those opportunities.”  Drillsearch is among explorers in Australia’s  Cooper Basin 
seeking to benefit from Asia’s demand for liquefied natural gas,
which has driven more than $60 billion of export projects being
built on the east coast. The Sydney-based company has 15 permits
in the outback region straddling the border of  South Australia 
and Queensland states, operating a dozen.  A need for funding to expand may drive further
consolidation and partnerships in the industry, Lingo said.  “There are companies who have, and there are the have
nots,” he said. “There are companies out there that have good
high-quality underlying assets, but don’t have the reserves,
production or cash flow. It’s our understanding they are finding
it quite challenging to attract capital.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
