Spain ’s Competition Regulator may
fine  oil companies  as much as 10 percent of sales if they are
deemed guilty of conspiring to inflate fuel prices.  The move comes a day after the European Union’s antitrust
chief said oil-price manipulation by companies such as  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ,  BP Plc (BP/)  and  Statoil ASA (STL)  may have wrought
“huge” damage to consumers through possible collusion by
traders. The EU raided the offices of three oil companies  this
month to investigate collusion.  Spain’s energy regulator, or the CNE, announced an
investigation of the so-called “Monday effect” earlier this
year, in which fuel prices consistently fall on Mondays, the day
the European Commission uses as reference for Spanish fuel
prices, and rise without justification on Tuesdays, the energy
regulator said in a  report .  The competition regulator inspected oil firms on May 27 and
May 28, it said in a statement. An unjustified increase in fuel
prices would be considered a “severe infraction” and companies
could be fined as much as 10 percent of sales of annual sales
prior to the fine, it said. A spokeswoman for the regulator
refused to name the companies involved in the probe, as the
investigation is ongoing.  Cia. Espanola de Petroleos SA , or Cepsa, which runs about
1,700 service stations in Spain, wasn’t one of the companies
inspected, a company official said.  No one was immediately available to comment at Lisbon-based
Galp Energia SGPS SA. A spokesman for  Repsol SA (REP)  declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
