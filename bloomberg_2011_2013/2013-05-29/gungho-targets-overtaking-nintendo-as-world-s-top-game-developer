GungHo Online Entertainment Inc. (3765) ,
maker of the most popular game for  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPhones, aims to
surpass  Nintendo Co. (7974)  as the biggest game developer by extending
the success of its “Puzzle & Dragons” to other titles.  “I want to top Nintendo’s sales by the time I retire,”
Chief Executive Officer Kazuki Morishita, 39, said in an
interview in  Tokyo  yesterday.  While GungHo’s revenue of 30.9 billion yen ($307 million)
in the three months ended March was about a third of Nintendo’s,
the company’s sales  surged  more than ninefold in the period
compared with a 1 percent rise for its larger rival. That growth
is underpinned by “Puzzle & Dragons,” a role-playing game that
is free to play while encouraging participants to buy and
collect characters.  “I want to make people think whatever GungHo does is
fun,” like they do at Nintendo, Morishita said. “I respect
Nintendo.”  Shares of GungHo have risen more than 13-fold in 2013,
compared with a 10 percent gain in Nintendo. For two days this
month, the company’s market value overtook that of Kyoto-based
Nintendo.  GungHo fell 5.3 percent to 1.135 million yen on the Osaka
Securities Exchange’s Jasdaq market. The stock has fallen 27
percent from a record close of 1.55 million yen on May 14.  3DS Expansion  Operating profit  surged 75-fold to 18.6 billion yen in the
three months ended March from 248 million yen a year earlier,
Tokyo-based GungHo said May 9.  “Puzzle & Dragons,” which is also the top-seller for
smartphones using Google Inc.’s Android software, was the
world’s top-grossing game app for smartphones in March,
according to the  App Annie Index , which measures revenue and
downloads.  The app was downloaded 14 million times as of May 18 since
it debuted in February 2012, the company said in a statement
today. It generated first-quarter sales of $3.4 million a day.  GungHo plans to introduce the game for Nintendo’s 3DS
handheld player later this year, it said last month.  With the 3DS version, “we are targeting children in a bid
to increase lifetime customers,” Morishita said. “We want to
sell at least 1 million units just like any other titles we
target.”  GungHo became a unit of  SoftBank Corp. (9984)  in April.  SoftBank, controlled by billionaire Masayoshi Son, is
 Japan ’s third-largest mobile phone operator. It owns stakes in
more than 900 publicly traded and closely held Internet
companies, including GungHo, Yahoo Japan Corp. and Alibaba Group
Holding Ltd.  GungHo Chairman Taizo Son is a brother of SoftBank’s
Masayoshi Son.  To contact the reporters on this story:
