Kazakhstan ’s Halyk Savings Bank
opposes plans to transfer the processing of electronic-card
transactions to the state, its chief executive officer said.  “Our position is clearly against,” Umut Shayakhmetova
told reporters in Almaty, the country’s commercial capital,
where the bank is based. The central bank should focus on
cleansing bad debt from Kazakh lenders rather than spend “wild
money” on creating a card-processing center, she said.  Halyk, which  earned  5.43 billion tenge ($36 million) from
card commissions last year, up 24 percent from 2011, controls
more than a fifth of the central Asian nation’s card market,
according to Shayakhmetova. The proposed state center would cost
about $100 million, she said.  The central bank’s plan is aimed at lowering transaction
fees for cardholders, Chairman Grigori Marchenko said May 17.
Kazakhstan, which tapped its National Oil Fund to prop up banks
in 2007-2009 as foreign funding dried up, is also creating a
state-owned pension fund unifying retirement assets currently
held by commercial lenders.  Kazkommertsbank, the country’s second largest lender by
assets behind Halyk,  said  May 24 that it also apposes the card-processing center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
