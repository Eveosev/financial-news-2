German stocks  fell after the
 International Monetary Fund  lowered its forecasts for  China ’s
growth and as data showed the number of unemployed Germans
increased more than forecast.  Commerzbank AG dropped 1.8 percent, for the second-biggest
loss on the benchmark DAX Index, after its Eurohypo unit lost a
suit over the payment of interest on profit certificates.
 Celesio AG (CLS1)  gained 1.4 percent as Jefferies & Co. advised
investors to buy the stock.  The DAX slid 1 percent to 8,398.28 at 9:57 a.m. in
Frankfurt. The measure is still heading for a 6.1 percent gain
in May and has rallied in all but one of the last 12 months as
central banks around the world maintained their stimulus
efforts. The broader HDAX Index also declined 1 percent today.  The IMF lowered its forecasts for China’s growth and said
making “decisive” policy changes would put the economy on a
more sustainable path.  Expansion will be about 7.75 percent this year and next,
 David Lipton , first deputy managing director of the IMF, said in
Beijing. In April, the IMF forecast growth of 8 percent this
year and 8.2 percent expansion in 2014.  The number of  people out of work  in  Germany , Europe’s
largest economy, increased a seasonally adjusted 21,000 in May,
a report showed today. Economists in a Bloomberg survey forecast
an increase of 5,000.  Elsewhere, the U.S. sells $35 billion of five-year notes
today after a two-year sale of the same amount yesterday drew
the fewest bids since February 2011. The Commerce Department
will probably say tomorrow the world’s biggest economy grew at
an annualized 2.5 percent pace in the first quarter, unchanged
from a preliminary reading last month.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the DAX
was 17 percent lower than the average of the past 30 days,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
