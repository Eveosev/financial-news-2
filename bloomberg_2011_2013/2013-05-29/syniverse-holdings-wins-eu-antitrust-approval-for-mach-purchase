Syniverse Holdings Inc. won European
Union approval for its plan to buy Mach, a rival provider of
services to mobile-phone companies, after EU regulators said it
agreed to sell a “significant part of Mach’s assets.”  The divestment concerns Mach’s Data Clearing services and
Near Trade Roaming Data Exchange services in  Europe , the
European Commission said in an e-mailed  statement  today. These
two types of services are technical steps of the roaming process
enabling people to use their mobile phones while travelling
abroad, it said.  “The proposed commitments will ensure that the merger does
not hamper the smooth functioning of wholesale roaming services
through an increase in price or a decrease in quality,”  Joaquin Almunia , the EU’s antitrust chief, said in the statement.  Syniverse, owned by  Carlyle Group (CG) , agreed to buy
Luxembourg-based Mach for about 550 million euros ($709 million)
in July. The company said it would cooperate with EU regulators
to resolve competition issues.  To contact the reporter on this story:
