Brazil  soybean shipments, which
typically are made through May, will be extended at least until
July as a record crop from the world’s top producer clogs ports
and roads.  “This is totally atypical for this time of the year,”
Isis Markarian, an analyst at Santos, Brazil-based consulting
company SA Commodities said today in a telephone interview.
“Waiting time has exceeded all expectations and I’m sure it
made export costs increase a lot,” she said.  Soybean vessels have been waiting as much as 39 days to
load at the country’s main port of Santos, and 55 days at the
second-largest oilseed port of Paranagua. That compares with an
average of 10 to 15 days a year ago for both ports, she said.  Brazil is forecast to surpass the U.S. in the 2012-2013
crop year to become the world’s largest producer of the oilseed
after a drought cut U.S. crop yields. Farmers in Brazil will
harvest 83.5 million tons, compared with U.S. output of 82.1
million tons, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said May 10.  China  is the top buyer of soybeans from Brazil, according
to Brazil’s Ministry of Agriculture website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
