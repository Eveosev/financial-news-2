Copper futures fell for the third
time in four sessions after German unemployment rose more than
expected and the International Monetary Fund cut its forecast
for economic growth in  China , the world’s top metal consumer.  A government report showed the number of people out of work
in  Germany  climbed a seasonally adjusted 21,000, exceeding the
5,000 increase forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. The
IMF said China’s economy will expand 7.75 percent this year and
next, down from an April forecast of 8 percent for 2013 and 8.2
percent in 2014.  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  resumed
some operations at its Grasberg mine in Indonesia after a deadly
accident on May 14 halted output.  “The German jobless figures, coupled with more signs of a
cooling economy in Asia, are weighing on copper,” Harry Denny,
a broker at PVM Futures Inc. in Hoboken, New Jersey, said in a
telephone interview. “Talk of Grasberg restarting was just too
much for the market to carry at this point.”  Copper futures for July delivery slid 0.5 percent to settle
at $3.297 a pound at 1:08 p.m. on the Comex in New York. The
price has dropped 9.7 percent this year.  Grasberg may reach a full daily production rate of 140,000
metric tons of ore in as soon as three days, said Rozik B. Soetjipto, the president director of PT Freeport  Indonesia . The
company needs approval to start underground mining.  BHP Billiton Ltd.’s Escondida site in  Chile  is the largest
copper mine, followed by Grasberg. The U.S. is the second-biggest user of the metal, followed by Germany.  On the London Metal Exchange, copper for delivery in three
months fell 0.8 percent to $7,265 a ton ($3.30 a pound). Tin and
nickel dropped, while aluminum, lead and zinc rose.  To contact the reporters on this story:
