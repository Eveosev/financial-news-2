Indian bonds fell for a second day on
speculation the rupee’s drop to a 10-month low will increase the
cost of imports and spur  inflation. (INFUTOTY)   Brent crude  rose 1.5 percent this week to $104.15 per
barrel, pushing up prices for  India  which imports about 80
percent of its oil. Inflation held above 9 percent for 14 months
through April. Lenders borrowed an  average  993 billion rupees
($17.7 billion) a day from the central bank’s repurchase auction
window this month, compared with 831 billion rupees in April,
indicating a shortage of cash.  “The rupee’s weakness could bring back inflation
concerns,” said Debendra Kumar Dash, a fixed-income trader at
Development Credit Bank Ltd. in Mumbai. “Although liquidity has
tightened, there has been no announcement by the central bank to
buy back debt. That is also damping sentiment.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent government notes due June
2022 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.38
percent as of 9:55 a.m. in Mumbai, according to the central
bank’s trading system. The rate fell 35 basis points this month.  The rupee dropped 0.3 percent to 56.1050 per dollar and
reached 56.1850, the weakest level since Aug. 3, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. It declined 4 percent this month, the worst
performance since May last year.  Reserve Bank  of India Deputy Governor H.R. Khan told
reporters yesterday in the western city of Pune that the
monetary authority was assessing the cash situation and will
“come out with something.”  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose two basis
points to 7.15 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
