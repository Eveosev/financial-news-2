Guinean President Alpha Conde said he
appointed a panel of judges to investigate the deaths of 12
people during an opposition protest over the perceived lack of
transparency in the electoral process.  “Nobody is above the law,” Conde said in a speech
broadcast yesterday on state-owned Radio Television Guineenne.
“The violence is unacceptable, highly irresponsible and
reprehensible.”  Preparations for legislative elections in  Guinea , the
world’s biggest bauxite exporter, have been marred by a series
of violent demonstrations that have pitted ethnic groups against
each other.  Conde’s opponents, including the ethnic Peul former Prime
Minister Cellou Dalein Diallo, say they fear the vote will lack
transparency and may be rigged in favor of the ruling party.
Conde, who is of Malinke origin, set the elections for June 30
after delaying the vote at least three times since 2011.  A public funeral for those killed in last week’s unrest
will be held today in the capital, Conakry, according to the
news website GuineeActu.info.  To contact the reporters on this story:
