Calapan Ventures Inc. (H2O)  is in talks to
provide water services to some towns in the Philippine islands
of Visayas and Mindanao, Chairman Jolly Ting said in a televised
interview with ABS-CBN News Channel.  Negotiations with Maynilad Water Services Inc. are “very
preliminary” and may be concluded in two to three months, Ting
said. Calapan Ventures on May 9 said Maynilad, which provides
water to half of the Philippine capital, is one of the parties
it is in talks with for possible cooperation.  Calapan shares rose 3 percent to 7.55 pesos as of 11:40
a.m., outpacing the Philippine benchmark stock index’s 0.2
percent gain.  -- With assistance from Clarissa Batino.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
