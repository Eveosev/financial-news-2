Philippine  stocks  advanced, driving
the benchmark index to its biggest gain in more than three
weeks, after Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said the
government will ensure economic growth stays high.  Jollibee Foods Corp., the nation’s biggest fast-food
company, climbed 8.8 percent while Globe Telecom Inc., the
second-largest mobile phone operator, rose 6.1 percent. First
Gen Corp. advanced 2.2 percent, rebounding from its lowest close
in seven months.  The Philippine Stock Exchange Index jumped 1.2 percent to
7,199.53 as of 3:07 p.m. in Manila, heading for the sharpest
gain since May 3. The government will set the “necessary
foundation” to sustain economic growth at higher levels,
Purisima said. Gross domestic product data for the first quarter
is scheduled to be released tomorrow.  “The finance secretary’s statement has helped bring back
confidence into the market,” said Astro del Castillo, managing
director of First Grade Holdings Inc. “It’s adding spice to the
outlook that economic growth will accelerate this year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
