TuneIn Inc., the digital-radio
service, raised $25 million in a new funding round led by
Institutional Venture Partners as the company tries to ramp up
efforts to attract users and advertisers.  The round, which follows a $16 million  investment  last
year, includes existing investors  Sequoia Capital , Google
Ventures and General Catalyst Partners, according to the
company. TuneIn also announced it hired Axel Martinez, formerly
an assistant treasurer at  Google Inc. (GOOG) , as its chief financial
officer, who will assist with investing the new funds.  TuneIn, which competes with  Pandora Media Inc. (P)  and Spotify
Ltd., offers mobile-device users access to about 70,000 radio
stations from around the world, including music, talk, sports
and news. The latest funding will be used to roll out products
and expand services to bolster revenue that’s shared with radio
stations, said John Donham, chief executive officer of TuneIn.  “What we see is a market opportunity that’s just
massive,” Donham said. “Ninety percent of the planet listens
to radio any given month, and yet TuneIn has only well over 40
million users at this point. I think our goal is, how does that
transition from tens of millions to hundreds of millions?”  As part of its efforts to attract more listeners, TuneIn
recently introduced a new service that adds personalization
tools to help users find  radio stations  and songs. The  Palo
Alto , California-based company said members have racked up more
than 1 billion listening hours so far this year.  “Radio hasn’t changed in a hundred years, and TuneIn is
finally bringing radio into the digital age,” said Jules Maltz,
a general partner at IVP who joined TuneIn’s board of directors.
“TuneIn allows us to have a fundamentally different and richer
radio experience.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
