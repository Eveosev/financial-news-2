French police arrested a 21-year-old
man who admitted to carrying out last weekend’s knife attack on
a soldier on the outskirts of Paris.  In a strike similar to that in  London  this month, the
soldier was stabbed in the neck as he patrolled a shopping
center in the business district of La Defense last Saturday.
While the soldier in London died, the French guardsman has been
hospitalized with injuries that were declared to be not life-threatening.  “The president wants to thank the police for their rapid
and professional work in carrying out the arrest,” Interior
Minister  Manuel Valls  said after today’s cabinet meeting with
President  Francois Hollande .  The stabber in Paris converted to Islam as a teenager and
“acted in the name of his religious ideology,” the French
capital’s prosecutor  Francois Molins  said in a press conference
today. On May 22, another convert to radical Islam killed the
British soldier in London with a meat cleaver.  The French suspect, who turns 22 tomorrow, didn’t have a
police record and was arrested this morning at the house of a
friend, Molins said. He was identified through video recordings
and personal belongings he’d left at the scene.  To contact the reporter on this story:
