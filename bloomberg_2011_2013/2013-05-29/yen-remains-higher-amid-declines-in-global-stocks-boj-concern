The dollar dropped to a three-week
low versus the euro as the U.S. economy expanded less than
previously estimated and jobless-benefit claims rose, reducing
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will cut back on stimulus.  The yen strengthened versus the greenback after Reuters
reported  Japan ’s public pension fund may allow its investment in
domestic stocks to grow, citing unnamed people familiar with the
matter.  Sweden ’s krona rallied versus all of its 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg. A gauge of currency-price
 swings  climbed to the highest level in almost a year.  “The data this morning is weighing on the dollar,”  Omer Esiner , chief market analyst in  Washington  at the currency
brokerage Commonwealth Foreign Exchange Inc., said in a
telephone interview. “It’s prompting investors to pare back
exposure on the dollar a little bit. But while the data was a
little worse than expected, it’s probably not enough to derail
talk of Fed tapering just yet.”  The U.S. currency slid 0.8 percent to $1.3050 per euro at 5
p.m.  New York  time. It touched $1.3061, the weakest level since
May 9, crossed 50- and 200-day moving averages and pared a
monthly advance to 0.9 percent. The dollar lost 0.4 percent to
100.73 yen. It touched 100.47, also the weakest since May 9,
when the Japanese currency depreciated past 100 for the first
time in four years. The euro gained 0.4 percent to 131.43 yen.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Global FX Volatility Index reached
10.05 percent, the highest level since June 28.  ‘Two-Way’  “In the last six months, investors have been trading bad
news as good news, meaning slower growth means the Fed will be
on hold for longer,” David Woo, global head of rates and
currencies at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in New York, said in
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene . “Stronger U.S. growth means the Fed is going to have to
taper sooner. If you’ve been trading liquidity all along, I
think this means the two-way risk is back.”  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $38 billion, versus $42 billion yesterday, according to
data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust Clearing
Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on the dollar-Chinese  yuan   exchange rate  amounted to $8.1 billion, the largest
share of trades at 21 percent. Dollar-yen options were the
second most-actively traded, at $6.6 billion, or 17 percent.  Dollar-yuan options trading was 208 percent above the
average for the past five Thursdays at a similar time in the
day. Dollar-yen options trading was 28 percent below average.  About $6 billion in dollar-yen options will expire tomorrow
at strike prices of 100.50, 100.80 and 101 yen, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Rand, Peso  South Africa ’s rand tumbled versus its 31 most-traded
counterparts after President  Jacob Zuma  failed to reassure
investors the government is doing enough to end labor unrest at
mines. The currency depreciated 2.1 percent to 10.0405 per
dollar, weakening past 10 for the first time since March 2009.  The  Mexican peso  fell to its lowest level in almost three
months as economic data in the U.S., the nation’s biggest trade
partner, trailed forecasts. The currency lost 1.1 percent to
12.7868 per dollar and slid as much as 1.6 percent to 12.8514,
the weakest since March 1.  Sweden’s krona advanced after Riksbank First Deputy
Governor Kerstin af Jochnick said the currency is at the right
level and backed by strong fundamentals in the economy. The
krona climbed 1.3 percent to 6.5616 per dollar and advanced 0.5
percent to 8.5619 per euro.  “Our public finances are in order, the banks are in order
and are well-capitalized, so there’s a general confidence in
Sweden,” af Jochnick told reporters today after a speech in
Uppsala, Sweden.  Koruna Climbs  The Czech koruna rose versus 31 most-traded peers as the
country’s 10-year government bond  yielded  1.8 percent after
reaching 1.83 percent yesterday, the highest since April 11. The
currency rallied as much as 1.5 percent, the most since Jan. 10,
to 19.7067 per dollar before trading at 19.7157. The koruna rose
0.6 percent to 25.726 per euro.  The dollar gained 2.7 percent over the past month versus
nine developed-nation peers, according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, amid bets the Fed would slow its bond-buying
under quantitative-easing stimulus as the  U.S. economy  improved.
Data showed employers added more jobs than forecast in April and
the  unemployment rate  unexpectedly fell to 7.5 percent.  Consumer
confidence  rose in May to a five-year high.  The greenback slid today versus most major peers as the
Commerce Department reported U.S. gross domestic product rose at
a 2.4 percent annualized rate in the first quarter. The median
forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey called for no
revision from the 2.5 percent pace initially reported.  Jobless Claims  Initial claims for  jobless benefits  in the U.S. rose 10,000
to 354,000 in the week ended May 25. A Bloomberg survey  forecast 
340,000 claims.  Japan’s public pension fund may allow its investment in
domestic stocks to grow, Reuters reported, citing unnamed people
familiar with the matter.  Managers of the Government Pension Investment Fund, which
oversees about 108 trillion yen ($1.1 trillion) in assets may
reduce the target allocation to domestic bonds, fund President
Takahiro Mitani said in a Bloomberg News interview on Feb. 1.
The fund may increase holdings in emerging-market stocks and
start buying alternative assets, he said.  The yen has slumped 11 percent this year, the most among
the 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes, as the  Bank of Japan  pledged to
double bond buying in an attempt to increase inflation.  The Dollar Index, which Intercontinental Exchange Inc. uses
to track the greenback against currencies of six U.S. trading
partners, fell to as low as 82.979, the least since May 14.  The currency gauge climbed last week to 84.498, the highest
level since July 2010, after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  told
Congress the central bank could cut the pace of its $85 billion
in asset purchases if officials see indications of sustained
improvement in U.S. economic growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
