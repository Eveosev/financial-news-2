Container freight rates on the key
Asia to North Europe route dropped 18 percent since the start of
the year as overcapacity continues to take its toll on the
shipping industry, said  Xeneta , a Norwegian company tracking
transport data on 1,700 trade lanes.  Average rates for standard 20-foot containers fell to
$1,233 today from $1,498 on Jan. 1, while prices for 40-foot
boxes dropped 20 percent to $2,163, according to Oslo-based
Xeneta, which was founded last year. The company collects data
from more than 50 freight sellers and buyers such as logistic
companies, food retailers and steel producers.  The arrival of a new generation of  container ships  and
falling demand for seaborne goods is increasing freight capacity
as the euro area remains mired in recession. Operators in
 Germany  have the world’s largest container shipping fleet and
are therefore among the most affected. Rates for 20-foot
containers slid 55 percent this month, compared with a year ago,
while prices to ship 40-foot containers have declined 44 percent
in that time, according to Xeneta.  “The current freight rate is loss-making for all players
in the industry and certainly it cannot sustain rates like this
forever,” said Peter Sand, the chief shipping analyst at
shipping association Bimco in Bagsvaerd,  Denmark .  Mediterranean Shipping Co., the world’s second biggest
container liner by capacity, on May 21  announced  a general rate
increase of $750 per 20-foot container from July 1 on the  Asia 
to Europe route, while Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd AG, the world’s
number six,  announced a $1,000  increase for the same route and
period on May 14.  Thomas Wybierek, a shipping analyst at Norddeutsche
Landesbank Girozentrale in Hanover, said he doesn’t expect a
repeat of the price war that depressed rates in 2011, “when
companies tried to undercut each other to keep their share of
the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
