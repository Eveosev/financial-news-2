Once in a while, progress and disaster get mixed up. Electroshock. Electropop.  Giant ice cubes. Have you been served the artisanal cocktail? A massive block of frozen water sits in a regular tumbler while the $14 cocktail miserably fills the remaining real estate. Any attempt at sipping feels like making out with an iceberg. You're game. You tip the glass forward. The ice cube collides with the bridge of your nose. And right after you were so intimate with it, too. So ...  why?   It has more surface area, keeping the drink colder without diluting it as fast as a regular ice cube, says Ezekiel Miller, general manager at the Flatiron Lounge in New York. Fine. If giant ice cubes are hot, Loot will stay cool. Give it time. History is on our side. James Tarmy reports on arts and culture for  Bloomberg Muse , the arts and leisure section of Bloomberg News.
