American International Group Inc. (AIG) , the insurer that repaid a U.S. bailout, reached a deal with People’s Insurance Company Group of China Ltd. for a joint venture to sell  life insurance  in China.  AIG will contribute 24.9 million  yuan  ($4.1 million) and People’s PICC Life Insurance Co. unit will contribute 75.1 million yuan to create a joint venture to sell life coverage in major Chinese cities, the Beijing-based parent company said yesterday in a statement.  AIG Chief Executive Officer  Robert Benmosche  is working to rebuild sales outside the U.S. after the New York-based insurer sold foreign units to help repay the U.S. rescue. AIG took a $500 million stake in PICC’s property-casualty unit last year in a bet on the world’s most populous nation.  “We’re going to put a concerted effort to start reestablishing AIG throughout the world with our life-insurance products,” Benmosche told Bloomberg Television in February.
