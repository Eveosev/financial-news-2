Tele2 Russia , the country’s fourth-largest wireless operator, named former OAO Rostelecom head
Alexander Provotorov as chief executive officer, less than two
months after VTB Group acquired the company for $3.6 billion.  Provotorov takes over from Jere Calmes, who was appointed
by Stockholm-based  Tele2 AB (TEL2B)  in February to head the Russian
unit. Calmes will be first deputy CEO, in charge of operations,
VTB said today in a  statement .  Tele2 sold the unit to state-run lender VTB even as
operators  VimpelCom Ltd (VIP)  and  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT)  were offering
a higher price. Provotorov was replaced as Rostelecom CEO by the
government in March. He previously worked for Marshall Capital
LLC, a 10.7 percent shareholder in Rostelecom.  “This is an unexpected twist, especially given that VTB
and Marshall Capital have a history of tense relations,”  Anna Lepetukhina , an analyst at Sberbank Investment Research, said in
a note. In February, VTB lost a bid to have a fraud lawsuit
involving Marshall Capital owner Konstantin Malofeev heard in
 London , where a court discharged an order that had frozen his
assets.  “Provotorov has always advocated that the logical path for
Rostelecom is to strengthen its position in the mobile
business” and has supported a merger of Rostelecom and Tele2
Russia, Lepetukhina wrote. Rostelecom remains the most obvious
candidate for an acquisition of Tele2 Russia, while “the
ultimate outcome could be anything at this point,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
