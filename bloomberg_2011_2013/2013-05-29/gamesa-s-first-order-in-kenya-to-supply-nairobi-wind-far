Gamesa Corp. Tecnologica SA (GAM) , Spain’s
largest wind-turbine maker, won an order to supply a project
near Nairobi, its first in  Kenya .  The Ngong II wind plant developed by Kenya Electricity
Generating Co. will use 16 turbines with a total capacity of
13.6 megawatts, Gamesa said today in a statement. The facility
will generate enough power for at least 9,500 homes when
operational around the second quarter of next year.  Gamesa is entering Kenya at a time when the nation seeks to
curb dependence on imported oil by boosting renewables including
geothermal and hydropower and to mitigate energy shortages and
supply disruptions that hamper growth.  The project 30 kilometers (19 miles) outside Nairobi will
be the country’s second wind farm and the largest in East
Africa, according to Zamudio-based Gamesa.  To contact the reporter on this story:
