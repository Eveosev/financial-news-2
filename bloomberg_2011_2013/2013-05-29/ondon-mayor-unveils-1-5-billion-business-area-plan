London  officials signed a deal with a
Chinese developer to build a commercial district targeting Asian
businesses at Royal Albert Dock near London City Airport.  The buildings on the 35-acre (14 hectare) site will be
worth about 1 billion pounds ($1.5 billion) when they’re
completed and fully leased, ABP Chinese (Holding) said in a
joint statement with the Greater London Authority. The project
will create as many as 20,000 jobs, they said.  The development will become London’s third business
district after the City of London and  Canary Wharf  and will be
worth 6 billion pounds to the U.K. economy, according to the
statement. The project includes about 300,000 square meters (3.2
million square feet) of office buildings, stores and leisure
space and the first phase is due to open in 2017.  “The reinvention of this once-maligned part of the capital
into a 21st century center of trade and investment” will “act
as a beacon for eastern investors looking west,” Mayor of
London  Boris Johnson  said in the statement.  ABP, based in Beijing, will own the Royal Albert Dock site
after construction is completed, Nabil Hanafi, a spokesman for
the developer said. ABP developed 400 office buildings in the
Chinese capital in a project that has been more than 95 percent
sold, the company said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
