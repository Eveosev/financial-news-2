Serbia’s government may be shuffled
after the European Union decides on June 28 whether to give it a
date for the start of membership talks,  Vecernje Novosti 
reported without saying where it got the information.  Changes may affect ministers and their portfolios in
Premier Ivica Dacic’s 11-month old Cabinet, managers of public
companies, mayors and heads of some municipalities, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
