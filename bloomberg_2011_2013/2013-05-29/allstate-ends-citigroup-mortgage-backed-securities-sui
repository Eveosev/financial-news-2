Allstate Corp. (ALL)  and  Citigroup Inc. (C) 
agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by the insurer in New York
state court accusing the bank of fraudulently selling hundreds
of millions of dollars of mortgage-backed securities.  Allstate, the largest publicly traded U.S. home and auto
insurer, sued Citigroup in State Supreme Court in  Manhattan  in
2011, along with banks including Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of
America Corp. and Morgan Stanley.  The Northbrook, Illinois-based insurer, which said in the
suit that it bought more than $200 million of securities from
New York-based Citigroup that were backed by residential
mortgages, voluntarily discontinued the case, according to a
court filing dated yesterday.  Allstate and Citigroup settled the case on “mutually
agreeable terms,” Daniel L. Brockett, an attorney with Quinn
Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan LLP representing Allstate, said in
an e-mail. A Citigroup spokesman, Scott Helfman, declined to
comment on the case in a telephone interview.  Justice Eileen Bransten in March denied bids by Morgan
Stanley, Deutsche Bank and Bank of America to dismiss Allstate’s
suits. In the case against Morgan Stanley, Bransten rejected an
argument that the lender is shielded from liability because
offering materials disclosed that representations about the
loans were based on information from originators.  The case is Allstate Insurance Co. v. Citimortgage Inc.,
650432/2011,  New York  State Supreme Court, New York County
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
