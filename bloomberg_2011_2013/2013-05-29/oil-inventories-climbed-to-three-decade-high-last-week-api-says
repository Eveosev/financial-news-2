Oil supplies rose to the highest
level in more than three decades as they climbed 4.4 million
barrels to 395.1 million last week, the American Petroleum
Institute said.  Distillate fuel inventories  increased 3.11 million to 121.5
million, the API’s weekly report showed.  Gasoline stockpiles 
advanced 1.94 million barrels to 221.4 million.  Crude at Cushing, Oklahoma , the delivery point for futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, gained 302,000
barrels to 50.4 million.  The Energy Information Administration, the Energy
Department’s statistical arm, is scheduled to release its
inventory report at 11 a.m. tomorrow in  Washington , a day later
than usual because of the Memorial Day holiday on May 27.  The government report may show supplies of oil decreased
500,000 barrels last week, according to the median of 11
responses in a Bloomberg survey of analysts. Gasoline stockpiles
dropped 500,000 barrels and distillate inventories decreased
450,000 barrels in the survey.  API collects stockpile information on a voluntary basis
from operators of refineries, bulk terminals and pipelines. The
government requires that reports be filed with the EIA for its
weekly survey.  Crude oil for July delivery fell $2.09, or 2.2 percent, to
$92.92 a barrel at 4:34 p.m. in electronic trading on the Nymex.
The contract, which settled at $93.13, traded at $93.14 before
the report was released at 4:30 p.m.  To contact the reporter on this story:
