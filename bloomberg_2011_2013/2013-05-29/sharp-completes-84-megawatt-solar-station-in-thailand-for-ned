Sharp Corp. (6753) , a Japanese maker of
photovoltaic panels, completed the final stage of an 84-megawatt
solar station in Thailand for Natural Energy Development Co.  The 10.3-megawatt facility is in addition to a 73.2-megawatt site completed in March 2012, Sharp said in a statement
today.  NED awarded the construction order for the project to
Sharp,  Italian-Thai Development Pcl (ITD)  and Italthai Engineering
Co., according to the statement.  The Osaka-based company supplied about 640,000 thin-film
solar modules that offer superior performance under high
temperatures compared with crystalline solar cells, according to
the statement. Sharp will also provide maintenance services for
the plant.  To contact the reporter on this story:
