Vietnam ’s bonds gained, driving the
benchmark five-year yield to the lowest since 2007, on
speculation slowing inflation will prompt the central bank to
cut  interest rates . The dong dropped.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam may lower its refinancing rate by
50 basis points to 6.5 percent next quarter if policy makers
remain comfortable with the inflation outlook and loan growth
stays weak, analysts at Standard Chartered Plc, including Hong
Kong-based Betty Wang, wrote in a note e-mailed today. It may
also reduce a 7.5 percent cap on dong deposit rates, they wrote.  The yield on five-year government notes fell five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.92 percent in Hanoi,
according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s the lowest since August 2007.  Vietnam’s government bonds will rally further on “easing
inflation and weak credit growth,” according to  Standard
Chartered . Bank loans increased 2.29 percent this year through
May 22, the central bank said on its website this week. That
compares with the authority’s full-year target of 12 percent.  The dong weakened 0.1 percent to 21,013 per dollar as of
4:30 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
State Bank of Vietnam set its  reference rate  at 20,828,
unchanged since December 2011, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the fixing.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
