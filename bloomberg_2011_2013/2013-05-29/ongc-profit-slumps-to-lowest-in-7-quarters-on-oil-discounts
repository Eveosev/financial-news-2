Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) ,  India ’s
biggest energy explorer, reported its lowest profit in seven
quarters after selling crude at steeper discounts.  Net income  fell 40 percent to 33.9 billion rupees ($603
million), or 3.96 rupees a share, in the fourth quarter ended
March 31, from 56.4 billion, or 6.6 rupees a share, a year
earlier, the New Delhi-based company said in a regulatory filing
today. That missed the 49.3 billion-rupee median  estimate  of 36
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Net sales rose 14 percent to
213.9 billion rupees.  Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram’s attempt to
narrow the  budget deficit  by raising diesel prices and giving
refiners including  Indian Oil Corp. (IOCL)  the freedom to set gasoline
prices will reduce the subsidy ONGC gives on crude oil sales.
The government orders the explorer to sell oil at a discount to
state refiners, which in turn sell fuels below cost to help curb
inflation.  ONGC has  gained  25 percent this year, compared with a 3.7
percent increase in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex. (SENSEX)  The shares
rose 0.3 percent to 334.95 rupees at the close in Mumbai today.
The earnings were announced after trading ended.  Total expenses rose to 182.2 billion rupees from 126.7
billion rupees a year earlier, the company said in the statement.
The subsidy was 123.1 billion rupees in the quarter, compared
with 141.7 billion rupees a year earlier.  Capital Spending  The company, which spent 295 billion rupees in the fiscal
year ended March 31, has a capital expenditure target of 350.5
billion rupees for this fiscal year, Chairman Sudhir Vasudeva
told reporters in New Delhi today.  ONGC, which produced 51.45 million tons of oil equivalent
in the last fiscal year, expects to produce 52.41 million tons
in the year ending March 31. The company today reported two
discoveries -- at KG shallow offshore and the western offshore
basin. The company said it plans to start producing gas from the
KG basin field by 2016.  The price of  Brent crude , a benchmark for more than half of
the world’s oil, fell 4.9 percent to an average $112.64 in the
quarter compared with a year earlier.  The lower profit may hurt ONGC’s plan to spend 11 trillion
rupees by 2030 to raise production and add reserves in India and
overseas. It plans to expand exploration in offshore areas in
India and buy shale gas and oil sands properties overseas,
Finance Director A.K. Banerjee said Oct. 2.  The company, the nation’s biggest natural gas producer,
will also benefit from the government’s plan to raise natural
gas prices. The oil ministry is studying a report by a panel led
by Chakravarthy Rangarajan, chief of the prime minister’s
Economic Advisory Council, that recommends linking natural gas
prices in India to global benchmarks. If accepted, rates may
almost double, benefitting producers such as ONGC and  Reliance
Industries Ltd. (RIL)   To contact the reporter on this story:
