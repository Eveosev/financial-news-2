Priceline.com Inc. (PCLN) , the largest U.S.
online travel agent by market value, increased its stock-repurchase program by $1 billion in tandem with a private debt
offering.  The company plans to use the net proceeds from the offering
to buy back as much as $450 million of its outstanding common
stock in privately negotiated transactions, Norwalk,
Connecticut-based Priceline said in a statement yesterday.  Subject to market conditions, Priceline said it will sell
as much as $1 billion in convertible senior notes due in 2020.
The initial purchaser will have the option of buying as much as
$150 million more in debt to cover an over-allotment.  Shares of Priceline increased as much as 1.5 percent to
$803.90 in extended trading. Earlier, they declined 1.5 percent
to $792.27 at yesterdayâ€™s close in  New York , leaving them up 28
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
