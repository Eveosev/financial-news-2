Gasoline fell on speculation that
supplies are rising as refineries restored units to production
and lower pump prices indicated regional tightness eased. The
crack spreads, returns on producing the motor fuel from West
Texas Intermediate and Brent crudes, widened.  Futures dropped 1.7 percent amid  production  at the highest
level this year in the week ended May 17 and  stockpiles  at the
most since April 5, according to Energy Information
Administration data. The average pump price in  Minnesota  is down
28.08 cents since May 20, when the state had the highest costs
in the continental U.S., said AAA, the nation’s largest motoring
organization.  “We’re seeing continued improvement in supplies,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for June delivery declined 4.97 cents to settle at
$2.8031 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
level since May 2. Trading volume was 0.6 percent below the 100-day average at 3 p.m. Gasoline’s discount versus heating oil
widened by 1.26 cents to 6.64 cents, indicating traders valued
gasoline less.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 4 cents to
$24.45 a barrel. July gasoline’s  premium  over July Brent rose 27
cents to $15.48 at 2:45 p.m.  The EIA, the statistical arm of the Energy Department, is
scheduled to report last week’s inventories tomorrow, a day
later than usual because of the May 27 U.S. Memorial Day
holiday. The report will probably say that gasoline supplies
declined 500,000 barrels, according to the median estimate of 11
analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  Gasoline  demand  increased 5.4 percent in the week ended May
17 while  consumption  averaged over four weeks was down 3.3
percent from the year before, EIA data showed. Memorial Day is
the traditional kickoff of the summer driving season.  Propping Prices  “No one is willing to prop the price up after the Memorial
Day weekend,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at
Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  “A one-week jump in
demand won’t likely be repeated. If refineries keep utilization
rates up, it’s not a bullish sign for gas.”  Futures deepened losses as equities fell and crude slipped
after the  International Monetary Fund  cut  China ’s growth
forecast. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.6 percent at
3 p.m. in  New York . Crude oil for July delivery on Nymex
declined 2 percent to settle at $93.31.  “Equities turned and oil turned,” said Amrita Sen, chief
oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a research company
in  London . “There’s a lot of focus today with the IMF trimming
growth rates.”  Gasoline at the  pump , averaged nationwide, fell 0.5 cent to
$3.621 a gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its
website. Prices have declined for seven consecutive days and are
1.5 cents below a year earlier.  ULSD for June delivery dropped 3.71 cents, or 1.3 percent,
to settle at $2.8695 a gallon on trading volume that was 22
percent below the 100-day average.  July ULSD’s  crack spread  versus WTI crude oil widened 45
cents to $27.41 a barrel. July ULSD’s  premium over Brent  fell 29
cents to $18.02 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
