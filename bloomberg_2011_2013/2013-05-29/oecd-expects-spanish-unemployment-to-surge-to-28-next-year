The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development forecast  Spain ’s unemployment will
surge to 28 percent in 2014 instead of peaking this year amid a
weaker economic outlook than estimated in November.  Spain’s  gross domestic product  will contract 1.7 percent
this year before rising 0.4 percent in 2014, the Paris-based
OECD said today in its Global Economic Outlook. That compares to
a November prediction of a 1.4 percent decline for 2013 and
growth of 0.5 percent in 2014.  The Paris-based organization said a slump in Spanish
household demand will be worse than previously estimated this
year, while exports will grow 4.5 percent in 2013, less than the
6.4 percent previously forecast. Unemployment will continue to
increase into 2014 it said, while it had earlier predicted it
would peak at 26.9 percent this year.  Prime Minister  Mariano Rajoy  is expecting the European
Commission to propose today that the fourth-largest economy in
the euro region be given two more years, until 2016, to tame the
highest  budget deficit  in the EU.  Spain’s budget gap last year widened to 10.6 percent of
GDP, more than three times the limit set by the EU for all
members, as it received European aid to bail out a banking
sector burdened by loans linked to the real estate sector.  To contact the reporter on this story:
