Morocco ’s economic growth may
accelerate to about 5 percent this year, driven by a bumper
harvest, Finance Minister Nizar Baraka said.  “Since the cereals harvest exceeded our initial forecast
by 50 percent, this should reflect positively on overall
economic growth that should hover around 5 percent this year,”
Baraka said in an interview at an African Development Bank
meeting in Marrakesh.  The economy grew 2.4 percent last year, Baraka said last
month, and the government had earlier projected growth of 4.5
percent for 2013.  Morocco has escaped the uprisings that swept across North
Africa in 2011. The government last year negotiated a $6.2
billion credit line from the International Monetary Fund, and
it’s seeking to reduce subsidies in order to rein in a widening
budget deficit.  The gap rose to 7.6 percent of gross domestic product last
year from 7 percent in 2011, Raza Agha, chief Middle East and
Africa economist at VTB Capital in  London , said in an e-mailed
note today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
