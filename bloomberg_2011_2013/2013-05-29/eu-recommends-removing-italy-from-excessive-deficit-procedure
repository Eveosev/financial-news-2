The European Commission recommended
lifting an excessive-deficit procedure against  Italy  after the
government brought its budget shortfall within the European
Union limit, commission Vice-President Antonio Tajani said.  The decision was made at 10 a.m. in Brussels today, Tajani
said by telephone. A formal announcement will be made this
afternoon. Tajani, the EU industry and entrepreneurship
commissioner, had earlier announced the move on his Twitter Inc.
account.  Italy’s Prime Minister Enrico Letta, who was sworn in on
April 28, pledged new measures to boost growth while keeping the
deficit below the EU’s ceiling of 3 percent of gross domestic
product. The euro region’s third-biggest economy, mired in its
longest recession in more than two decades, will contract 1.8
percent this year, according to the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development.  “We must exit from the excessive-deficit procedure to
recover margins to maneuver within the European rules that we
want to respect,” Letta said in his first speech to parliament
in  Rome  on April 29. “Without growth and without cohesion,
Italy is lost.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
