Australia ’s dollar rallied from the
lowest in more than 19 months after data showed building
approvals grew more than economists estimated, reducing the case
for the Reserve Bank to cut  interest rates .  Interest-rate swaps  data compiled by Bloomberg show traders
see a 27 percent chance the  Reserve Bank of Australia  will lower
its benchmark to 2.5 percent at its next meeting, down from 48
percent earlier. Demand for New Zealand’s kiwi dollar was
limited after central bank Governor Graeme Wheeler said it is
“significantly overvalued.”  “We’ve seen a really decent bounce in building
approvals,” said  Annette Beacher , head of Asia-Pacific research
for TD Securities Inc. in  Singapore . “Net data should be
positive, but subsequently the Aussie dollar fell initially and
is now back up.”  Australia’s dollar rose 0.5 percent to 96.82 U.S. cents as
of 4:27 p.m. in Sydney from yesterday, when it dropped to 95.28,
the lowest since October 2011. It’s poised for a 6.6 percent
drop this month, the biggest slide since May 2012.  The Aussie climbed 0.3 percent to NZ$1.1928 from yesterday,
when it touched NZ$1.1818, the weakest since January 2009. It
was little changed at 97.44 yen from yesterday, set for a 3.6
percent drop this month.  New Zealand’s dollar advanced 0.3 percent to 81.22 U.S.
cents from yesterday. The kiwi lost 0.3 percent to 81.68 yen.
For the month,  New Zealand ’s currency is down 5.2 percent
against the greenback and 2.1 percent versus the yen.  Australian Economy  In Australia, building approvals rose 9.1 percent in April
from the previous month, when they decreased 5.5 percent, the
statistics bureau said today. The median estimate of economists
in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 4 percent increase.  The Aussie briefly fell after separate government data
showed  capital expenditures  unexpectedly dropped. Spending
declined 4.7 percent in the first quarter from the previous
three-month period. That compared with a 0.5 percent increase
predicted by economists.  “The Aussie initially fell on the small capital
expenditure number, but then as we’ve crunched through the
outlook for next year, it’s a little better than expected,”
said TD’s Beacher. “I don’t think it does provide any sort of
trigger for an RBA cut next week.”  Australia’s  10-year note  yield fell 7.5 basis points, or
0.075 percentage point, to 3.40 percent.  The kiwi dollar has risen 7.3 percent in the past 12
months, the biggest gainer after  Sweden ’s krona among the 10
developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The Australian dollar has lost 1.5 percent in
the same period.  Technical Indicator  The Australian currency’s 14-day relative strength index
was at 26 yesterday, below the 30-level that some traders see as
a sign an asset price may reverse direction after falling too
rapidly.  The  Reserve Bank  of New Zealand sold a net NZ$256 million
($207 million) of the kiwi dollar in April, the most since May
2008, the central bank said on its  website  today. Its
intervention capacity was NZ$8.48 billion as of April 30, the
data show.  “In recent months we have undertaken foreign-exchange
transactions to try and dampen some of the spikes in the
 exchange rate ,” Wheeler said in a  speech  in Auckland today.
“We are prepared to scale up our foreign-exchange activities if
we see opportunities to have greater influence.”  New Zealand’s two-year swap rate, a fixed payment made to
receive a floating rate, rose one basis point to 2.96 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
