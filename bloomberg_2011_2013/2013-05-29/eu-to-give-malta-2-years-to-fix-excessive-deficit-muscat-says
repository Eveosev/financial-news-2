The Maltese government is “fully
committed” to bringing its  budget deficit  below the European
Union’s ceiling this year, after the EU put  Malta  on notice for
its excessive spending gap, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said.  The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, told Malta
to reach a deficit target of 3.4 percent of gross domestic
product this year and 2.7 percent in 2014, under the EU’s 3
percent ceiling. The 2012 deficit was 3.3 percent of GDP.  Being placed in a so-called excessive-deficit procedure by
the Brussels-based commission strengthened the Maltese
government’s resolve that “it will not miss the target,”
Muscat said in an e-mailed statement after the EU decision.  The commission said that the “exposure to the real estate
market of Malta’s core domestic banks needs to be closely
monitored and relevant measures should be put in place.”  “While other banks operating from Malta have limited links
with its domestic economy, they account for 790 percent of its
GDP and therefore these should be strictly supervised to prevent
the accumulation of imbalances,” the commission said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
