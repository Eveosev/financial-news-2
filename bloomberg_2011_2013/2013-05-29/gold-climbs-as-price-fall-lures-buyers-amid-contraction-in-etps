Gold futures advanced for the first
time in three sessions as lower prices lured buyers of the
physical metal. Silver also gained.  Gold demand in  India , the world’s largest buyer, is heading
for a quarterly record as imports reach 300 to 400 metric tons,
the  World Gold Council  said in a report today. That’s equal to
almost half of the total shipments for all of last year. Prices
that dropped 17 percent this year are headed for the second
straight monthly loss as some investors lost faith in the metal
amid an improving economic outlook and concern that the  Federal
Reserve  may curb its stimulus measures.  “Physical buying in  Asia  remains strong,” Miguel Perez-Santalla, a vice president at New York-based BullionVault, said
in a phone interview. “Today’s news out of the World Gold
Council is very positive.”  Gold futures for August delivery climbed 0.9 percent to
settle at $1,391.80 an ounce at 1:48 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York . Yesterday, prices slipped 0.6 percent after topping
$1,400.  “Gold is surging toward $1,400 again, as the World Gold
Council opined today about record demand from Asia offsetting
ETF liquidations,”  Dave Lutz , the head of exchange-traded fund
trading and strategy at Stifel Nicolaus & Co. in Baltimore, said
in an e-mailed note today.  Trading was 55 percent higher than the average for the past
100 days for this time of day, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Assets in exchange-traded products backed by the
metal have shrunk 18 percent this year.  Silver futures for July delivery rose 1.2 percent to
$22.453 an ounce in New York.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery retreated 1.2 percent to $750.10 an ounce. Trading
was more than double the average in the past 100 days for this
time, according to Bloomberg data.  Platinum futures for July delivery slid 0.6 percent to
$1,453 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
