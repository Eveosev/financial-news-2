Roku Inc., the closely held online
video service, said it received $60 million in funding from new
investors to expand its Web-based movie and television streaming
services.  Hearst Corp. and an unidentified institutional investor
joined  News Corp. (NWSA) ,  British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY)  and other
backers who have previously invested in the company, in the new
funding round, Saratoga, California-based Roku said today in a
statement.  Rokuâ€™s TV set-top boxes download movies and shows to Web-connected television sets from content providers including  Time
Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) ,  Comcast Corp. (CMCSA)  and  DirecTV. (DTV)  The investment
will be used to help Roku work with equipment manufacturers to
expand access to its streaming platform, the company said today.  The company in August announced agreements to work with
equipment makers including Haier Electronics Group Ltd., Hitachi
America and Mitsubishi Electric to create televisions that can
access online services like those provided by  Netflix Inc. (NFLX) 
without a set-top box.  Roku has sold more than 5 million of its streaming devices
in the U.S., according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
