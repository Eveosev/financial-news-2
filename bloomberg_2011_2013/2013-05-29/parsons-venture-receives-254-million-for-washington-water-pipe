A joint venture of Parsons Corp., the
closely held Pasadena, California-based construction  firm , was
awarded a $254 million contract for an underground water tunnel
under the Anacostia River in  Washington .  Impregilo-Healy-Parsons will design and build the Anacostia
River Tunnel, which will reduce sewer runoff in the area,
according to a statement today from Parsons.  The tunnel will be 23 feet (7 meters) wide and run for
12,300 feet. It’s part of the District of Columbia Water & Sewer
Authority’s $2.6 billion  Clean Rivers Project , which is expected
to reduce overflows into the Anacostia and Potomac rivers and
Rock Creek by 96 percent.  Parsons owns 35 percent of Impregilo-Healy-Parsons and is
the lead designer on the tunnel, according to the statement.
Construction is expected to be finished in 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
