Mark Teixeira  and  Kevin Youkilis  each
went 0-for-2 with a walk in the first of two rehabilitation
games they’ll play with the New York Yankees’ minor-league
affiliate in Trenton, New Jersey.  Teixeira has been out since March with a partially torn
tendon sheath in his right wrist, while Youkilis went on the
disabled list April 30 with a back sprain. Both are scheduled to
rejoin the Yankees on May 31 for the start of a three-game Major
League Baseball series against the Boston Red Sox.  Youkilis played third base and batted third in today’s game
for the Trenton Thunder, flying out to right field and popping
out in his first two at-bats before walking and scoring a run in
the sixth inning. Teixeira started at first base and batted
fourth, with a pop-up, a walk and a strikeout.  The Yankees are one game out of first place in the American
League East division with a 30-21 record while playing without
Teixeira, Youkilis and All-Stars including  Derek Jeter , Curtis Granderson and  Alex Rodriguez , who are also out with injuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
