Dealers are offering prices on
credit-default swaps linked to Greek sovereign bonds after the
contracts paid out last year following a restructuring of the
nation’s debt.  It now costs $3.5 million in advance and $100,000 annually
to insure $10 million of Greek debt for five years, signaling a
49.4 percent probability of default within that time, according
to CMA. The data provider, which compiles quotes from dealers in
the private market, has published prices on Greek swaps every
day since May 21.  CMA received quotes irregularly since the government
imposed losses on bondholders in March 2012 and had not provided
prices since Feb. 28.  Greece  is not among the top 1,000 entities
captured by the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.’s central
registry for the default swaps market.  Previous contracts were settled when Greece forced
investors to exchange their bonds at a loss in the biggest ever
debt restructuring.  To contact the reporter on this story:
