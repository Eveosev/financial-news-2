The 2009 vintage of Chateau Angelus,
a Bordeaux wine estate rated one of Saint-Emilion’s top four
growers in last year’s classification, climbed to a record 2,650
pounds ($4,005) a case on the London-based Liv-ex market.  That’s 3.7 percent up from the previous high of 2,556
pounds reached March 13 and 38 percent above the low of 1,920
pounds touched in July, prior to the estate’s promotion.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 6 percent this
year, with an 8 percent gain in the 10 weeks to mid-March pared
by a 2 percent decline since then.  Angelus was promoted with Chateau Pavie in September to the
rank of Premier Grand Cru Classe A in the Saint-Emilion 2012
classification drawn up by  France ’s Institut National de
l’Origine et de la Qualite, or INAO. The two estates joined
Chateau Cheval Blanc and Chateau Ausone, which were already
ranked at the top of the appellation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
