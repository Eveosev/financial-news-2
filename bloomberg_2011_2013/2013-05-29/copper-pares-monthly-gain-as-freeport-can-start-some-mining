Copper fell, paring its first monthly
gain in four months as  Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  said
it can start open-pit production at  Indonesia ’s Grasberg mine
after an accident halted operations.  The metal for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange retreated as much as 0.6 percent to $7,276.75 a metric
ton and was at $7,311.75 at 10:46 a.m. in  Tokyo . The price has
risen 3.6 percent this month. Futures for delivery in July on
the Comex were little changed at $3.3135 per pound.  Freeport can start open-pit work, though it has yet to
receive permission to start underground mining at its Grasberg
mine complex, Daisy Primayanti, a spokeswoman for the Phoenix-based miner’s Indonesian unit, said yesterday. Production hasn’t
restarted yet at second-largest copper mine, where 28 workers
were killed when an underground tunnel collapsed May 14.  “The Freeport news has eased concern over mine supply
disruption,” said  Tetsu Emori , the chief fund manager at Astmax
Asset Management Inc. in Tokyo. While metals were also under
downward pressure from the dollar’s strength, a decline in LME
stockpiles and improving U.S. economic data would limit further
losses, he said.  The Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against those
of six major U.S. trade partners, rose for a second day, adding
as much as 0.3 percent. It reached 84.498 on May 23, the most
since 2010. A rise in the dollar curbs demand from buyers
holding other currencies.  U.S.  consumer confidence  climbed in May to the highest
level in more than five years, a Conference Board report showed
yesterday. Separate data showed U.S. house prices rose in the 12
months through March by the most in seven years as the recovery
in residential real estate gained momentum.  Copper  stockpiles  monitored by the LME fell for a third day
to 619,650 tons. Orders to remove the metal from warehouses
climbed 0.5 percent to 223,150 tons, the first gain after three
declines from the record on May 21.  The contract for September delivery was little changed at
52,690  yuan  ($8,588) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  On the LME, zinc and lead declined, while tin climbed.
Aluminum and nickel were little changed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
