Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd. (JI) ,  Asia ’s
largest irrigation-equipment maker, said fiscal fourth-quarter
profit fell 76 percent as demand was affected by a prolonged
drought in parts of  India .  Jain, based in Jalgaon, reported standalone net income of
419 million rupees ($7.5 million) for the three months ending
March 31 compared with 1.73 billion rupees a year earlier.  Sales of micro-irrigation systems fell 20 percent due to
“significant drought” in western Maharashtra state, the
company said today in an e-mailed statement. Maharashtra, home
to India’s financial capital of Mumbai, accounts for 60 percent
of the area under drip irrigation in the nation,  according to 
Jain’s website.  “We believe the worst is definitely behind us,” Managing
Director Anil Jain said in the statement. “In terms of dynamics
of evolving issues, we feel water management and distributed
energy is the need of the hour.”  Jain’s solar business sales grew 34 percent in the quarter,
buoyed by irrigation-pumping systems powered by solar panels
that allow farmers to save on diesel fuel costs.  The shares gained 1.4 percent to 68.6 rupees today,
trimming their decline to 8.5 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
