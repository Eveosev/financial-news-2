Serbian lawmakers backed amendments
to tax laws designed to curb spending and ensure savings
equivalent to 1 percent of economic output.  Parliament supported a cut in the  payroll tax , an increase
in the tax-exempt  minimum wage , higher pension contributions and
changes to property tax calculations, according to a television
broadcast of the session.  The vote followed a warning by the  International Monetary
Fund  a week ago that the budget gap is at risk of reaching 8
percent of gross domestic product with unchanged policies.
Serbia accumulated a four-month budget deficit of 76 billion
dinars ($878 million) through April, or 62 percent of the full-year target.  “The situation is grave, but it’s neither dramatic nor
catastrophic” and the measures will only “mitigate” rather
than solve problems,’’ Finance Minister  Mladjan Dinkic  told
lawmakers on May 24. The 2013 budget may be revised by July to
ensure that savings equal 2 percent of GDP, in line with the IMF
recommendations, according to Dinkic.  The Fiscal Council, a three-member body appointed by the
legislature to oversee fiscal compliance, also cautioned that
Serbia needs to narrow the gap to 4.5 percent of GDP this year
and to 3 percent in 2014 to avoid a debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
