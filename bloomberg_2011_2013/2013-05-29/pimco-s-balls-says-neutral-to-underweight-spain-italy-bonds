Spanish and Italian government bonds
aren’t compelling investments and Pacific Investment Management
Co. is cautious on the securities, according to  Andrew Balls ,
head of European portfolio management at the firm.  “We are neutral-to-underweight on Italy and Spain,” Balls
said at a media briefing in London today. “Our bias is to be
quite cautious. We prefer looking at absolute value not relative
value. Spain and Italy offer reasonable risk-reward but are not
compelling.”  An underweight position means the fund holds fewer
securities than the benchmark it uses to track performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
