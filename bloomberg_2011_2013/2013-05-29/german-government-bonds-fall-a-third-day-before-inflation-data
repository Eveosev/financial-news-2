Spanish 10-year bonds fell, extending
their first monthly decline since August, as concern the U.S.
Federal Reserve will pare debt purchases dented the appeal of
fixed-income assets.  Italian securities also declined. The bonds of both nations
aren’t compelling investments and Pacific Investment Management
Co. is cautious on the debt,  Andrew Balls , head of European
 portfolio management  at the company said today. German 10-year
bund yields climbed to the  highest  level in three months as a
report showed inflation accelerated more than economists
expected in May after falling to the lowest level since August
2010 the previous month.  “The tightening in spreads for peripheral countries has
made them more sensitive to risk-free yield shifts,” said
Alessandro Giansanti, a senior rates strategist at ING Groep NV
in Amsterdam. “Italian and Spanish bonds are no longer cheap
and investors are becoming increasingly reluctant to take
outright long positions in these markets.”  Spain ’s 10-year yield climbed 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, to 4.40 percent at 4:20 p.m.  London  time. The
yield has increased 27 basis points since April 30. The 5.4
percent bond maturing in January 2023 fell 0.895, or 8.95 euros
per 1,000-euro ($1,294) face amount, to 107.69.  “We are neutral-to-underweight on  Italy  and Spain,”
Pimco’s Balls said at a media briefing in London. “Our bias is
to be quite cautious. We prefer looking at absolute value not
relative value. Spain and Italy offer reasonable risk-reward but
are not compelling.”  An underweight position means the fund holds fewer
securities than the benchmark it uses to track performance.  German Inflation  The annualized  inflation rate  in  Germany , calculated using
a harmonized European Union method, jumped to 1.7 percent from
1.1 percent in April, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden
said. Economists had forecast an increase to 1.4 percent,
according to the median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg  survey .
Price increases erode the value of the fixed payments on bonds.  A separate report showed  German unemployment  rose more than
economists estimated in May.  The number of people out of work climbed a seasonally
adjusted 21,000 to 2.96 million, the Nuremberg-based Federal
Labor Agency said. That’s the fourth consecutive monthly
increase. Economists predicted an increase of 5,000. The
adjusted jobless rate held at 6.9 percent, just above a two-decade low of 6.8 percent.  Germany (GDBR10) ’s 10-year bund yield rose four basis points to 1.54
percent after climbing to 1.55 percent, the most since Feb. 25.  Italian Auction  Italy sold 8 billion euros of six-month bills at an average
yield of 0.538 percent, up from 0.503 percent at a previous sale
on April 26. Ten-year Italian yields added 15 basis points to
4.19 percent.  The extra yield, or  spread , that investors get for holding
U.S. Treasury 10-year notes instead of German bunds increased to
as much as 73 basis points today, the most since June 2010. The
spread has jumped from 44 basis points at the end of 2012.  Securities in the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Global
Broad Market Index have fallen 1.3 percent in May, poised for
the steepest loss since April 2004.  Spanish  government bonds  handed investors a loss of 0.8
percent this month through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. Italian securities lost 0.2 percent and
German bonds dropped 1.4 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
