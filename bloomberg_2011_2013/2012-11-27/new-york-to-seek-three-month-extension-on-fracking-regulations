     Nov. 27 (Bloomberg)--  New York  state will seek a 90-day
extension of the Nov. 29 deadline to develop fracking rules,
which would reopen a public-comment period, said Emily DeSantis,
a spokeswoman for the Environmental Conservation Department  The extension, if granted by the Office of Administrative
Hearings, would allow Health Commissioner Nirav Shah time to
analyze the issue with the help of an outside panel, whose
members were chosen this month, DeSantis said in an e-mailed
statement. The study, ordered in September by Governor  Andrew Cuomo â€™s administration, caused New York to miss the deadline.  The state has been studying hydraulic fracturing for more
than four years and issued a moratorium in 2010 so regulators
could conduct an environmental review and develop rules. By
requesting the extension, the DEC avoids restarting the entire
review process.  To contact the reporter on this story:
