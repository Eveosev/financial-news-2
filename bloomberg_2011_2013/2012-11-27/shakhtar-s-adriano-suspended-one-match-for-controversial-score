Shakhtar Donetsk striker Luiz
Adriano was suspended for one Champions League match for his
controversial score against Nordsjaelland, UEFA said.  European soccer’s ruling body said on its website it banned
the Brazilian for Shakhtar’s final group match against Juventus
for “violation of the principles of conduct.” He will also do
“one full day of community football service,” UEFA said.  The incident came after Shakhtar’s Willian punted the ball
back to Nordsjaelland after play was stopped for an injury in
the Nov. 20 match. Adriano took possession of the ball after it
was kicked downfield, went around the goalkeeper and put it into
the open net.  It was one of three goals he scored in the 5-2 win that
secured a place in the round of 16 for Shakhtar.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
