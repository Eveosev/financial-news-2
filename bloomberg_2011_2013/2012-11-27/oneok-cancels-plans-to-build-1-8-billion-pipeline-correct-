(Corrects figure in headline.)  Oneok Partners LP (OKS)  canceled plans to
build a $1.8 billion pipeline from the Bakken Shale because it
didn’t receive enough long-term commitments from shippers.  The Bakken Crude Express would’ve been a 1,300-mile (2,100
kilometers) oil pipeline connecting the Williston Basin in  North
Dakota  and Montana to the crude hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, Oneok
said in a statement today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
