U.S. house prices rose 4.4 percent
in the 12 months through September as the housing market
recovers from a six-year slump, the  Federal Housing Finance
Agency  said.  Prices climbed 0.2 percent from August, the FHFA said today
in a report from  Washington . That was below the 0.4 percent
average estimate of 14 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  U.S. home values have increased this year as improving
 employment  and record-low borrowing costs bolster demand and
buyers compete for a tightening supply of available properties.
An S&P/Case-Shiller index of prices in 20 U.S. cities rose 3
percent in September from a year earlier, the most since July
2010, the group said today.  In the third quarter, prices increased 1.1 percent from the
previous three months and 4 percent from a year earlier,
according to the FHFA report.  The FHFA data, which is based on single-family houses with
mortgages backed by  Fannie Mae  or  Freddie Mac , doesnâ€™t provide a
specific price. The  median price  of an existing single-family
home, as measured by the National Association of Realtors, was
$184,300 in September, up 11 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
