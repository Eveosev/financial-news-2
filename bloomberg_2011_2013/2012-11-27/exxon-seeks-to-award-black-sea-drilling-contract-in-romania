Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Romanian unit
called for bids from companies interested in providing offshore
drilling services in the Black Sea under a contract estimated to
be worth $250 million to $750 million.  The contract is for the duration of 48 months and includes
drilling one to seven wells in the Black Sea, where Exxon is
looking for natural gas together with  Romania ’s biggest oil
company  OMV Petrom SA (SNP) , according to a European Union  procurement
document  published today.  Bidders can submit offers until Jan. 7, 2013 for the
contract, which will be financed by Exxon from its own funds,
according to the document submitted by ExxonMobil Exploration
and Production Romania Limited Nassau.  Austria’s  OMV AG (OMV) , the majority-owner of Petrom, said on
Feb. 22 that it discovered what may be its biggest gas find in
the Black Sea well it is exploring together with a unit of
Exxon.  The Domino-1 well, which is operated by the Exxon unit,
encountered 70.7 meters of net gas pay, resulting in a
preliminary estimate for the accumulation ranging from 1.5 to 3
trillion cubic feet (42 to 84 billion cubic meters), OMV said.
Drilling operations started at the end of 2011 and the total
depth of the well is estimated to be more than 3,000 meters
below sea level.  To contact the reporter on this story:
