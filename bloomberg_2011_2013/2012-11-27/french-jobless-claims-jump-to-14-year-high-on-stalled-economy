French jobless claims jumped to a
14-year high as a stalled economy prompted companies to trim
payrolls and investment.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
45,400, or 1.5 percent, to 3.103 million, the Labor Ministry
said today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. Economists
predicted an increase of 28,600, according to the median of six
forecasts gathered by  Bloomberg News .  The increase brings jobless claims to their highest since
April 1998, increasing pressure on President  Francois Hollande 
to tackle labor rules and costs in a push for competitiveness
that he has promised by year-end.  With almost no economic growth in more than a year, French
business confidence is near a three-year low and companies
including Alcatel-Lucent SA and  PSA Peugeot Citroen (UG)  have
announced plans to cut thousands of jobs in recent months as
demand for their products slumps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
