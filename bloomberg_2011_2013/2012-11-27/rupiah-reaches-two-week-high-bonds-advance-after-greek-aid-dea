Indonesian  government bonds  advanced,
pushing the yield on the two-year notes to a six-month low,
after the  finance ministry  canceled an auction scheduled for
today and bought sovereign debt in the secondary market.  The ministry announced on Nov. 23 it was calling off the
sale of rupiah-denominated securities. Overseas investors
boosted their holdings of local-currency government  bonds  by
14.03 trillion rupiah ($1.5 billion) this month to a record
264.36 trillion rupiah as of Nov. 21, finance ministry data show.
The two-year yield has fallen 40 basis points in November.  “Investors are seeking to buy bonds more aggressively
because of limited supply,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, the head
of treasury research at state-owned PT Bank Negara  Indonesia  in
Jakarta. “Gains in bonds will be limited from now on as the
recent rally has been quite strong.”  The yield on Indonesia’s 11 percent bonds due October 2014
fell four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 4.84
percent, the lowest level since May 15, according to closing
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  The government bought 500 billion rupiah of four-year
sovereign bonds from the secondary market today to organize its
portfolio of securities, according to a statement on the debt
management office’s website.  The rupiah was steady at 9,600 per dollar as of 4:58 p.m.
in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg show.
It touched 9,583 earlier, the strongest level since Nov. 14.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in
exchange rates used to price options, held at a four-year low of
4.40 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
