SolarCity Corp. (SCTY) , the developer of
rooftop solar-power systems whose chairman is billionaire  Elon Musk , is seeking as much as $151 million in an initial public
offering.  The company and its existing shareholders plan to sell
about 10.1 million shares at $13 to $15 each, according to a
regulatory filing today. SolarCity plans to list on the Nasdaq
Stock Market under the symbol SCTY, and may price the offering
on Dec. 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company is seeking to go public amid a global
oversupply of solar components that’s driven down the  price  of
photovoltaic panels 19 percent in the past year. That’s pummeled
the share price of manufacturers including  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  and
Suntech Power Holdings Co., and will aid SolarCity, the company
said.  “While these developments have adversely impacted panel
manufacturers and the overall upstream market, we and other
downstream companies have benefited significantly,” SolarCity
said in the filing. “In 2006, the year we commenced business,
solar panel prices were 472 percent higher than now,” and the
company expect prices to continue to fall.  SolarCity will have 71.7 million shares of common stock
outstanding, and the float will be 14 percent. At the midpoint
of the proposed range, SolarCity’s market value will be about $1
billion.  SolarCity was founded by brothers  Lyndon Rive , the
company’s chief executive officer, and Peter Rive, chief
operations and technology officer, Musk’s cousins.  SolarCity is offering 10 million shares, while existing
owners plan to sell 65,000.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , Credit Suisse Group AG and Bank
of America Corp. are leading the offering.  To contact the reporter on this story:
