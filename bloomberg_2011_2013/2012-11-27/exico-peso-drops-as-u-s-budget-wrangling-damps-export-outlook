Mexico ’s peso fell for a second day
as concern mounted that U.S. politicians aren’t making headway
on budget talks, damping the economic outlook for the chief
destination of the Latin American country’s exports.  The currency dropped 0.2 percent to 13.0403 per U.S. dollar
today in Mexico City. The peso is up 6.9 percent this year,
still the best performance among the greenback’s 16 most-traded
counterparts in 2012.  The currency slumped after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid told reporters he was disappointed with the lack of
progress lawmakers were making in reaching a deal to avoid $607
billion in tax increases and spending reductions set to begin in
January. The Congressional Budget Office has said the so-called
fiscal cliff could lead to a recession in the U.S., where Mexico
sends about 80 percent of its exports.  “U.S. fiscal issues remain the most immediate risk to the
global economic outlook, and the proverbial falling of the cliff
would push the U.S. economy into a recession next year,”  Aryam Vazquez, an economist at Wells Fargo & Co., said in an e-mailed
message.  “It’s that simple.”  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2022 fell one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.53 percent. The price
increased 0.11 centavo to 107.19 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
