European Union President Herman  Van Rompuy  urged EU lawmakers to accept a smaller seven-year budget
for the bloc, highlighting the limits set by a U.K.-led group of
opponents of greater expenditure.  As countries in Europe cut their own spending to tackle the
debt crisis, Van Rompuy told the European Parliament the veto
power that each of the 27 national leaders in the EU wields over
the bloc’s 2014-2020 budget plan necessitates a reduction
compared with the 2007-2013 period.  “The need for unanimity constrains the possible
outcomes,” he said to members of the EU assembly today in
Brussels. “We must work on a moderation budget. The times call
for it.”  Van Rompuy is seeking to win over European lawmakers for
the first shrinking of the EU’s “Multiannual Financial
Framework” while searching for an agreement among national
leaders, who deadlocked on the matter at a two-day meeting last
week. EU Parliament members have criticized proposals to cut
European expenditure, saying it is a collective investment tool
that becomes more important during a time of national austerity.  The EU’s seven-year budget guidelines, traditionally a
tussle between richer nations that are net contributors and
poorer countries mainly in eastern and southern  Europe , are a
gauge of the bloc’s political mood and coherence. Regional and
agricultural aid soaks up around four-fifths of EU expenditure,
funding everything from transport networks to farmers’ incomes.  Added Significance  The sparring over 2014-2020 European spending has taken on
added significance as the region seeks to contain a three-year-
old debt crisis threatening to break up the 17-nation euro.  National governments finance  70 percent  of the EU budget,
which totals 994 billion euros ($1.28 trillion) in 2007-2013.
The European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, had proposed a
4 percent boost to 1.03 trillion euros in 2014-2020.  The richest EU countries including the U.K. and  Germany 
oppose an increase, saying it would be inconsistent with efforts
by national governments to narrow their budget deficits. That
prompted Van Rompuy to recommend a reduction to 973 billion
euros in 2014-2020 in the run-up to last week’s summit of
national leaders.  That amount was still too much for financially stronger
countries that pressed for another 30 billion euros in cuts. The
Nov. 22-23 meeting ended with Van Rompuy saying he would
organize another summit early next year in a bid to strike an
accord among the national leaders.  “An agreement is difficult, but necessary,” Van Rompuy
said today in the EU Parliament, which must also approve the
2014-2020 budget. “It will require more time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
