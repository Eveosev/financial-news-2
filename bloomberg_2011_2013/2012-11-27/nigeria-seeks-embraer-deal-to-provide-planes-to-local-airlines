The Nigerian government is in talks
with  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  on how its domestic airlines can secure aircraft
from the world’s fourth-biggest planemaker, Aviation Ministry
spokesman Joe Obi said.  A preliminary agreement to pursue discussions was reached
during a visit last weekend to the Brazilian company’s
headquarters by Nigerian aviation officials, Obi said in an e-
mailed statement yesterday.  Nigeria’s government “is seeking a partnership with
Embraer that will lead to a discussion on how these new aircraft
will be procured at very competitive, fair, and concessionary
rates,” Federal Airports Authority of Nigeria Managing Director
George Ureisi said during the visit. “There is no established
record of sustainability for these airlines mainly because of
the use of wrong equipment.”  The aviation safety record in  Africa ’s most-populous nation
was tarnished when a Dana Airlines Ltd. plane crashed during its
approach to the airport in Lagos, the commercial capital, on
June 3, killing all 153 people on board.  Three months later, Air Nigeria Ltd. suspended its
operations due to the “disloyalty” of some staff and a weak
business environment, according to the airline’s chairman, Jimoh Ibrahim.  To contact the reporter on this story:
