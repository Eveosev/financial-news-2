Flooding in the U.K. over the past
week will cost insurers as much as 500 million pounds ($800
million), making this year the most expensive for water damage
since 2007, according to  PricewaterhouseCoopers LLC .  Heavy rains have swept through England and  Wales  in the
past week, causing about 940 homes to flood in the southwest and
northeast of England and Wales since Nov. 21, according to the
U.K.’s  Environment Agency . The 500 million-pound bill for
insurers includes some flooding in September, PwC said.  “This is very much a high-level estimate while events are
still unfolding,” Domenico Del Re, head of catastrophe
management at PwC, said in a telephone interview.  The damage caused by the recent weather brings the overall
flood insurance bill for 2012 to 1 billion pounds, the most
since 2007, when the British army was drafted in to help rescue
people from high water amid record summer showers. This year’s
recent rain follows the wettest April to June period since
records began.  The Environment Agency currently has 198 flood warnings in
place and expects river and groundwater levels to peak in the
next 48 hours as the rain subsides.  The U.K.’s biggest property and casualty insurers,
including  Direct Line Insurance Group Plc (DLG)  and  Aviva Plc (AV/) , are
lobbying the government to maintain or increase spending on
flood defenses in return for a commitment from the insurance
industry to insure the worst affected areas. The current
agreement, called the Statement of Principles, ends next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
