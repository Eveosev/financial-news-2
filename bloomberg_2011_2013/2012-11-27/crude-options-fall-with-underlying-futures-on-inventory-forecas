Crude oil options volatility
declined with the underlying futures as supplies were forecast
to increase and Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid  said little
progress had been made in budget talks in  Washington .  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
January, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 27.07 as of 4:40 p.m. on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange , down from 27.52 in the previous
trading session.  Crude oil for January delivery fell 56 cents to settle at
$87.18 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Crude
inventories probably increased last week by 350,000 barrels to
374.8 million, according to the median estimate of 11 analysts
in a Bloomberg survey.  The budget debate and concern about the so-called fiscal
cliff helped push oil lower. Congress returns from the
Thanksgiving recess this week, seeking a budget deal to avoid
$607 billion automatic tax increases and spending cuts from
taking effect next year.  Democrats and Republicans have made little headway in
negotiations, according to Reid, a Nevada-based Democrat.  Active Options  The most active options in electronic trading today were
January $80 puts, which gained 2 cents to 25 cents a barrel on
volume of 2,942 lots at 4:44 p.m. January $90 calls were the
second-most active, with 2,152 lots exchanged as they declined
31 cents to 91 cents a barrel.  Puts accounted for 57 percent of the 36,614 lots traded.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information the next business day on open-
outcry volume, where the bulk of options activity occurs.  In the previous session, puts made up 58 percent of the
69,234 lots traded.  January $80 puts were the most actively traded options
yesterday with 3,059 contracts. They were unchanged at 23 cents
a barrel. June $90 puts rose 22 cents to $7.22 on volume of
3,000 lots.  Open interest was highest for January $105 calls, with
46,654 contracts. Next were January $60 puts with 34,924 lots
and January $110 calls with 31,504.  To contact the reporter on this story:
