Colombia ’s peso bond yields dropped
to a two-week low after policy makers unexpectedly cut borrowing
costs to buoy economic growth.  The yield on the 9.25 percent peso-denominated bonds due in
May 2014 slid eight basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to
4.96 percent, the lowest since Nov. 13, according to the central
bank. The price rose 0.099 centavo to 105.842 centavos per peso.  Banco de la Republica lowered the target lending rate by a
quarter-percentage point to 4.5 percent on Nov. 23, surprising
all except two of 33 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. Policy
makers voted 4-3 to cut  borrowing costs  to the lowest in a year.  “The market usually takes about three days to incorporate
surprise rate decisions,” said Daniel Lozano, the head analyst
at Serfinco SA brokerage in Bogota. “Yields in the short and
medium part of the curve should continue to fall.”  The peso was little changed at 1,824.72 per  U.S. dollar . It
has appreciated 0.4 percent in November and risen 6.2 percent
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
