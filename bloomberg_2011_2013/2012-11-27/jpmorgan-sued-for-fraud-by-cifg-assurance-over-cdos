JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  was sued by
CIFG Assurance North America Inc., which says it lost more than
$100 million on collateralized debt obligations created by Bear
Stearns, the investment bank JPMorgan acquired in 2008.  Bear Stearns stocked the CDOs with toxic mortgage
securities and profited by betting against the portfolios, the
insurer said in a complaint filed yesterday in  New York  State
Supreme Court. Bear Stearns told CIFG that independent firms had
selected the collateral, New York-based CIFG said.  “As a result of its fraud, Bear Stearns was able to pass
off huge losses onto CIFG,” according to the complaint.  CIFG said it was induced to provide financial-guaranty
insurance on credit default swaps guaranteeing payment on notes
issued by ACA ABS CDO 2006-2 Ltd. and Libertas Preferred Funding
II Ltd., according to the complaint. CIFG last week sued Bank of
America Corp. for fraud over guaranty policies tied to mortgage
securities.  Jennifer Zuccarelli , a spokeswoman for New York-based
JPMorgan, didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking
comment on CIFG’s complaint.  The case is CIFG Assurance North America Inc. v. J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, 654074-2012, New York State Supreme Court
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
