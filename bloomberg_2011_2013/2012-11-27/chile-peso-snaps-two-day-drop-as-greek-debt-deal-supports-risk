Chile’s peso snapped a two-day
decline after European finance ministers agreed to terms of an
aid package for  Greece , supporting demand for higher-yielding,
emerging-market assets.  The peso was little changed at 481.54 per  U.S. dollar  at
10:48 a.m. in Santiago after dropping 1 percent over the past
two trading days. International investors in the Chilean peso
forwards market cut their bets against the currency to a six-
month low of $6.9 billion on Nov. 23, data published today by
the central bank show.  “The Greek news suggested the  exchange rate  should have
opened lower than it did, but there’s no euphoria,” said
Cristian Donoso, a trader at Banchile Corredores de Bolsa SA in
Santiago.  European ministers cut the rates on bailout loans,
suspended interest payments for a decade, gave Greece more time
to repay and engineered a Greek bond buyback. The country was
also cleared to receive a 34.4 billion-euro ($44.7 billion) loan
installment in December, boosting hopes that the 17-member
currency union can survive intact.  International investors sold a net $101 million of dollar
forwards on Nov. 23. Local investors bought $393 million of
dollar forwards, central bank data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
