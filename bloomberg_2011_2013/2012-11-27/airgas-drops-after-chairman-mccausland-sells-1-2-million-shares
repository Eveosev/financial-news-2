Airgas Inc. (ARG) , the largest U.S.
distributor of packaged gases, fell the most in two months after
Chairman  Peter McCausland  sold about 15 percent of his stake in
the company he founded 30 years ago.  Airgas, based in Radnor,  Pennsylvania , dropped 2.7 percent
to $87.99 at the close in New York, the most since Sept. 27.  McCausland, who built Airgas with almost  450 acquisitions 
since 1982, sold 1.2 million shares in a privately negotiated
overnight block trade, retaining about 7 million shares, the
company said today in a statement. The sale was in connection
with tax planning matters and repayment of debt incurred to
exercise stock options, Airgas said.  McCausland, 62, stepped down as chief executive officer in
August to focus on strategy and acquisitions. He was succeeded
by Michael L. Molinini, formerly Airgas chief operating officer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
