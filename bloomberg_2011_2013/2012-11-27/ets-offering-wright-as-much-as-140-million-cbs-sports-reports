The New York Mets have offered third
baseman  David Wright  a seven-year contract worth as much as $140
million,  CBS Sports reported , citing unidentified people
familiar with the talks.  Wright declined to confirm the report, saying it has been
“important to me from the beginning that these negotiations
remain confidential,” according to MLB.com.  Wright, 29, has spent all nine of his Major League Baseball
seasons with the Mets and last year set the franchise record for
career hits with 1,426. The six-time All-Star, who has a career
.301 batting average with 204 home runs and 818 runs batted in,
is due to make $16 million in 2013, the final year of his
current contract.  “Imagine the  Atlanta Braves  without  Chipper Jones ,”
teammate R.A. Dickey said, according to MLB.com. “You just
can’t. I think (Wright and the Mets) are going to reach an
agreement.”  CBS Sports said the new deal could pay Wright about $20
million per season. The Mets said negotiations with Wright’s
representatives are in progress and wouldn’t comment further.
Seth and Sam Levinson, Wright’s agents, didn’t immediately
return a telephone message left at their Brooklyn office.  The Mets also are negotiating a contract extension with
Dickey, who has one year and $5 million left on his current
deal, MLB.com reported.  Mets Chief Operating Officer  Jeff Wilpon  said last week he
would consider trading Wright or Dickey only as a last resort,
MLB.com said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
