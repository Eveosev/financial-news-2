The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  has
formed a golden cross with its 50-week moving average climbing
above its 100-week moving average, a pattern that suggests
equities will rally, according to a technical analyst.  The Stoxx 600’s next resistance level lies between 275 and
280, Julius de Kempenaer, a senior technical analyst at Taler
Asset Management Ltd. in Gibraltar, wrote in an e-mail. “Once
this level is cleared, the next stop should be approximately 290
and after that there will be even more upside potential,” said
de Kempenaer.  The 50-week moving average has climbed above the 100-week
average on two previous occasions over the last decade. The
benchmark measure rallied 65 percent following a  crossover  in
April 2004 and  7.9 percent  after the same event in April 2010.  The  Stoxx 600 jumped 4 percent  last week as optimism
mounted that the  U.S. Congress  and President  Barack Obama  will
agree on a budget, stopping automatic tax increases and spending
cuts from coming into force early next year. The equity
benchmark slipped 0.5 percent to 272 yesterday.  Technical analysts use golden crosses to confirm that
equities will rally. They use death crosses, which occur when
the 50-day moving average crosses below the 200-day line, to
help indicate when they should sell shares.  “Today we see a  golden cross ,” said de Kempenaer. “But
there was also a reverse crossing in late 2011. The actual price
level of the index was pretty much the same back then and there
was also not a huge decline based on the negative cross taking
place. This indicates that the market is in a sideways pattern,
which is visible even better when you look at the almost
horizontal slope of the 100-week average.”  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study price
graphs to predict changes in a security, commodity, currency or
index.                                                       To contact the reporter on this story:
