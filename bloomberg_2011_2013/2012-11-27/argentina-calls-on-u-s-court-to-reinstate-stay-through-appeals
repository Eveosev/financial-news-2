Argentina  called on a U.S. court to
reinstate a stay through an appeals process after Judge Thomas
Griesa lifted the measure as part of a ruling ordering the South
American country to pay holders of defaulted debt $1.33 billion
by Dec. 15.  Argentina said that Griesa’s reading of the pari passu
clause is unfair, and that a scenario where holdouts seek equal
terms as investors who accepted swaps in restructurings could be
debated in Congress, according to an e-mailed statement from the
 Economy Ministry .  “If Griesa had provided a payment formula pro rata that
treated these participants and those in the same position in the
terms that Argentina offered in 2010, that would have been
consistent with the precedents allowed by Argentine law and
could be debated by Congress,” the ministry said, adding that a
formal appeal was filed in  New York  courts yesterday.  Argentina said that Griesa’s Nov. 21 ruling is “an attempt
at threatening the compliance of Argentina with its performing
debt” and that due process is needed to “protect the
continuity of the New York financial system, its financial
agents and all sovereign debt holders.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
