Kenya ’s shilling weakened against
the dollar, heading for the lowest level in almost six months,
as companies were said to seek the U.S. currency to settle year-
end obligations.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy fell as much
as 0.2 percent to 86.07 a dollar and was trading less than 0.1
percent lower at 85.95 by 4:14 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi. A
close at that level would be the weakest since June 4, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “We’ve seen a lot of demand in the market for dollars as
we come to the end of the year; multinationals are repatriating
for dividends and profits, importers are settling their bills,”
Benard Matimu, chief dealer at Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd., said
by phone.  The Central Bank of Kenya withdrew 7.93 billion shillings
(92.3 million) from the financial markets through the sale of
seven-day repurchase agreements and 14-day term auction
deposits.  Uganda’s shilling fell for a seventh day, declining 1.3
percent to 2,695 a dollar, heading for its lowest close since
October 2011. The Tanzanian shilling retreated 0.1 percent to
1,610 a dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
