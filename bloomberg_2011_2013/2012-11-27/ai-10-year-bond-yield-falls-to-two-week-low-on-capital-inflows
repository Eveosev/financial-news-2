Thailand ’s government bonds rose,
sending the 10-year yield to the lowest level in more than two
weeks, after global investors added to holdings amid optimism
the local economy is improving. The baht weakened.  Imports climbed 22 percent in October, beating the median
forecast in a Bloomberg survey for a 9.6 percent gain, official
data showed yesterday. Overseas purchases fell 7.7 percent in
September. Foreign funds purchased $655 million more local debt
than they sold this month through yesterday, according to data
from the Thai Bond Market Association.  “A big increase in imports indicates the strong domestic
demand in Thailand,” said Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-
ichi Life Research Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Funds continue to
flow into the Southeast Asia region, including Thailand and
especially to the bond markets.”  The yield on the 3.65 percent bonds due December 2021 fell
one basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 3.38 percent as of
8:45 a.m. in Bangkok, the lowest level since Nov. 8, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The baht slipped 0.1 percent to 30.70 per dollar, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. One-month implied volatility, a
measure of expected moves in exchange rates used to price
options, held steady at 4.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
