National Grid Plc (NG/) , which manages
electricity networks in  Great Britain  and three northeast U.S.
states, invested $40 million in Clean Line Energy Partners LLC
to help the company build  power lines  for onshore wind farms.  Clean Line plans to use the funding to develop four
projects that will deliver 14,000 megawatts of wind power
generated in Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, Iowa and  New Mexico  to
consumers in other states, National Grid said today in a
statement.  Closely held Clean Line develops high-voltage direct
current transmission systems, which are more efficient than
alternating current systems that move power with more electrical
losses, according to the company’s  website . It wants to deliver
power from some of the windiest areas of the U.S. to cities that
don’t have access to the clean energy due to a lack of
transmission.  Under the transaction’s terms, National Grid will be able
to acquire “a significant ownership stake” in Clean Line’s
HVDC projects, according to the statement. Clean Line’s other
backers, Ziff Brothers Investments and the Zilkha family, will
retain their existing equity stakes in the Houston-based
company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
