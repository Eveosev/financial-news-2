Ukraine’s state budget gap widened
almost threefold in the first 10 months of the year as spending
rose 16 percent, the Finance Ministry said.  The shortfall from January through October amounted to 33.2
billion hryvnia ($4.1 billion), compared with 12.4 billion
hryvnia in the same period of 2011, the Kiev-based ministry said
in a statement on its  website  today.  Ukraine raised 5.66 billion hryvnia from January to October
by selling state assets, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
