Households are in a poor position to
sustain U.S. economic growth because their wages are failing to
keep pace with inflation, according to Pavilion Global Markets
Ltd. strategists.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, average hourly earnings at
private employers have fallen on an inflation-adjusted basis all
but once since February 2011, according to monthly data compiled
by the Labor Department. The exception occurred in July, when
so-called real earnings were unchanged.  “Consumers will spend more only if they feel richer,”
 Pierre Lapointe , head of global strategy and research, and two
colleagues at Pavilion wrote in a Nov. 21 report. They don’t at
the moment because of the effects of inflation, the report said.  Real earnings may decline as long as U.S. unemployment
exceeds 6 percent, the Montreal-based strategists wrote. Last
month’s jobless rate was 7.9 percent, and most economists in a
Bloomberg survey expect this month’s figure to be unchanged.  Spending is poised to stall next year unless prices of
financial assets and homes keep rising, which would lead to
greater household wealth, they wrote.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index has advanced 12 percent
this year and the Treasury’s 10-year note has produced a return
of 5.5 percent.  House prices  increased 6.8 percent in the first
eight months of the year, according to the S&P/Case-Shiller
index for 20 U.S. cities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
