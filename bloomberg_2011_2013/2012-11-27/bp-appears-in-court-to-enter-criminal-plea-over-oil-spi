BP Plc (BP/)  appeared in federal court in
New Orleans to answer U.S. charges brought over the 2010 Gulf of
Mexico  oil spill .  A not guilty plea today wonâ€™t affect its $4 billion
criminal settlement with the federal government. BP announced
the settlement with the U.S. Justice Department Nov. 15,
agreeing to plead guilty and pay $4 billion to end all criminal
charges related to the largest offshore oil spill in U.S.
history. Under the plea deal, BP will enter a formal guilty plea
at a later hearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
