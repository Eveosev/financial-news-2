The Tennessee Titans fired offensive
coordinator Chris Palmer following a 4-7 start during which the
team ranked  24th  among the National Football League’s 32 teams
in yards gained.  Palmer, a former head coach of the  Cleveland Browns  and
assistant for the  New York  Giants and Dallas Cowboys, was
replaced by Titans quarterbacks coach Dowell Loggains.  “As an offense I didn’t feel like we were progressing the
way that I had hoped,” Tennessee coach  Mike Munchak  said in a
statement. “We needed a change in direction and I hope to see
that progress in our remaining games. Dowell has worked here for
a number of years under some very successful coordinators and he
is ready for this challenge.”  The Titans host the 10-1 Houston Texans Dec. 2 before
visiting the 7-4 Indianapolis Colts seven days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
