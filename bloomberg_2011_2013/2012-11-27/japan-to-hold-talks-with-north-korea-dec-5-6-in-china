Japan and  North Korea  will hold a
second round of working level talks next month in  China  after
meeting earlier this month, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said.  Shinsuke Sugiyama, director-general of the Foreign
Ministry’s Asia-Pacific bureau, will head the Japanese
delegation, Fujimura said.  The two sides met Nov. 15-16 in Ulan Bator, Mongolia to
discuss issues including North Korea’s abduction of Japanese
citizens in the 1970s and 1980s and the North Korean nuclear
program, in the first such talks since 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
