Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
biggest automaker, plans to increase production in  China  by 40
percent in three years and add higher-end models as it seeks to
gain market share in the world’s largest market.  Beijing Hyundai Motor Co., its passenger-car venture with
Beijing Automotive Group Co., will boost production to 1.4
million units by 2015 and double the ratio of mid- to high-end
products to more than 50 percent during the period, the company
said in an e-mailed statement today.  Hyundai is among foreign automakers announcing expansion
plans in China as they target the world’s largest pool of first-
time buyers. Passenger-vehicle sales in the nation will expand
by an average 8 percent a year to reach 22 million units in
2020, driven by demand for sport-utility vehicles and rising
incomes in smaller cities, according to McKinsey & Co.  The maker of the Elantra sedan and  Santa Fe  sport-utility
vehicle increased China sales 11 percent to 676,746 units in the
first 10 months of this year, according to the China Association
of Automobile Manufacturers, putting it on pace to exceed the
739,800 units sold in 2011.  The automaker, which currently operates three factories in
the country with a total capacity of 1 million units, produced
its 4-millionth car yesterday, it said in the statement.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
