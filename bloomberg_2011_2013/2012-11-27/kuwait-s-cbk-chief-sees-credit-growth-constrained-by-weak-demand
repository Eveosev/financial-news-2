(Corrects loan growth in August in last paragraph of story
first published on Nov. 27.)  Commercial Bank of Kuwait  said it
expects local credit growth to remain constrained on reduced
company demand, its chief executive said.  “A lot of companies have excess capacity already and
therefore they will use their existing credit lines,” Nuhad Saliba, the bank’s chief executive officer, said in an interview
in  Kuwait City  on Nov. 26.  Borrowing by the private sector in OPEC’s third-biggest
producer increased at the slowest pace in at least 17 years in
2011 as political wrangling deterred a $110 billion state
development plan. The central bank on Oct. 4 cut the key
 interest rate  by 50 basis points to 2 percent to spur growth.  Loan growth to private businesses and consumers was 5.5
percent in August, according to central bank data. It will be
between 5 percent and 6 percent next year “at best,” Saliba
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
