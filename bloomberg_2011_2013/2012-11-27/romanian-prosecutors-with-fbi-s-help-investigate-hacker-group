Romanian prosecutors are
investigating a group of 16 people for alleged fraud of about
$25 million by hacking the information systems of different
international companies.  Organized crime prosecutors already raided the houses of
those involved in the group in four Romanian cities and two
counties, the Department for Investigating Organized crime and
Terrorism  said in a statement on its website.   The group members used several firms to hack the IT systems
of foreign gas stations and stores, intercepted clients’ credit
cards payments and then illegally used the data, according to
the prosecutors’ statement.  The Romanian prosecutors and the police received the help
of the FBI for discovering the group, according to  Realitatea
TV , private television station.  To contact the reporter on this story:
