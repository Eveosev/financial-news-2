India ’s Rajasthan state called for
bids to set up 200 megawatts of solar-power projects after
delaying the process for almost a year.  The state is auctioning contracts for 100 megawatts of
photovoltaic plants and 100 megawatts of solar-thermal plants,
according to bidding  documents  posted on the website of the
state-run Rajasthan Renewable Energy Corp.  While the northwestern state, which has some of India’s
most promising terrain for sun power, called for bids last
December, it never carried out the auction. Bids this time are
due by Jan. 11 and will be opened the same day, according to the
documents.  Rajasthan receives on average the most solar irradiation in
India after the neighboring state of Gujarat, according to a
joint study by the India Meteorological Department and the
Ministry of New and Renewable Energy.  Contracts are available for photovoltaic projects of 5 or
10 megawatts each and for solar-thermal plants of 50 megawatts
each. Solar thermal technology uses sunlight to heat liquids
that produce steam for generators, while photovoltaic plants use
panels to turn sunlight directly into power.  Companies can bid for both types and also import equipment
and technology for their projects, according to the agency’s
rules.  Developers will have a year to complete photovoltaic plants
and two years to complete solar-thermal plants, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
