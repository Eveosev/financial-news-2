Ethanol strengthened against
gasoline on higher corn prices, reducing the motor fuel’s
premium to a two-week low.  The grain-based additive’s discount to gasoline contracted
to 29.41 cents a gallon, the least since Nov. 8, from 32.03
cents yesterday, based on December futures prices. The
difference was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28.  Ethanol rose with corn on concern that the worst U.S.
winter-wheat conditions in at least 27 years will increase
demand for corn to be used to feed livestock. One bushel of corn
makes at least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  “I’m bullish,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price Futures
Group in Chicago. “Not a strong bull, but bullish. We have
strength in corn and they definitely dance to the same tune.”  Denatured ethanol for December delivery rose 3.2 cents, or
1.3 percent, to settle at a six-week high of $2.438 a gallon on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices are up 11 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 0.58 cent to
$2.7321 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The
contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with
ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  The Energy Department will probably report tomorrow that
 gasoline supplies  rose 900 million barrels last week, according
to the median estimate of 11 analysts in a survey by Bloomberg.  Ethanol-blended gasoline made up about 89 percent of the
total U.S. gasoline pool in the week ended Nov. 16, Energy
Department data show, the lowest level since Sept. 14.  Corn for March delivery climbed 12.75 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $7.64 a bushel in  Chicago , also a six-week high.  In cash market trading, ethanol was unchanged in  New York 
at $2.50 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.40, in the U.S. Gulf at
$2.455 and on the West Coast at $2.57, data compiled by
Bloomberg shows.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 33 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, up from 31
cents yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  Ethanol  output  in the week ended Nov. 16 was 811,000
barrels a day, below the 2012 average of 864,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
