Gilts declined, pushing the 10-year
yield to a three-week high, after European Union finance
ministers eased the terms on emergency aid for Greece, damping
demand for the safety of U.K. government debt.  The pound strengthened to highest in three weeks against
the dollar before a report that analysts said will confirm the
U.K.  economy  exited a double-dip recession in the third quarter.
 Gross domestic product  rose 1 percent in the three months ended
September, according to the median forecast of 33 economists in
a Bloomberg News survey before a second reading of the data is
published at 9:30 a.m. in London.  “The immediate reaction has obviously been driven by
events in Europe,” said  Brian Barry , an analyst at Investec
Bank Plc in London. “Whether that’ll continue or whether the
focus will turn to the state of the underlying domestic economy
will depend on what, if any, revision we see to the GDP
number.”  The 10-year gilt yield rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 1.86 percent at 9:23 a.m. London time. It
earlier advanced as much as five basis points to 1.88 percent,
the most since Nov. 2. The 1.75 percent bond due in September
2022 fell 0.19, or 1.90 pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,603) face
amount, to 99.025.  Bank of England  Governor  Mervyn King  and policy makers  Paul
Fisher ,  Martin Weale  and Ben Broadbent speak before lawmakers
today. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  was appointed to
replace King as the next head of the BOE yesterday.  Gilts returned 2.8 percent this year through yesterday,
according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. German bunds gained
3.6 percent and U.S. Treasuries earned 2.5 percent.  The pound was little changed at $1.6030, after rising to
1.6052, the strongest level since Nov. 2. Sterling was at 80.94
pence per euro, after falling to 81.14 pence, the weakest since
Oct. 24.  Sterling has gained 1.1 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-market currencies. The euro declined 2.2 percent and
the dollar fell 2.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
