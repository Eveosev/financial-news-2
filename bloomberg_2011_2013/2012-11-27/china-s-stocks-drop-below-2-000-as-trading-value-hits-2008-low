China’s stocks  fell, with the
benchmark index closing below 2,000 for the first time since
2009, as the value of shares traded slumped to the lowest in
four years. Material and health-care companies led losses.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  dropped 1.3 percent to
1,991.17 at the 3 p.m. local-time close, its lowest level since
Jan. 23, 2009. Shares  worth  33.1 billion yuan ($5.3 billion)
changed hands in the measure yesterday, the least since Nov. 7,
2008, while  data  showed that the number of A-share trading
accounts that made transactions last week fell to 5.6 million,
the lowest for a five-day week since at least January 2008.  “Investors are voting with their feet,”  Zhang Ling , general
manager at Shanghai River Fund Management Co., said by phone.
“Regulators need to roll out policies such as encouraging more
investments in the biggest stocks to restore investors’
confidence.”  Inner Mongolia Baotou Steel Rare-Earth Hi-Tech Co. sank 4.5
percent, while Shandong Dong-E E-Jiao Co., a traditional
medicine-maker, declined 3.1 percent. JiuGuiJiu Co. tumbled 10
percent after Beijing News said the liquor maker will halt
production to replace equipment.  The Shanghai Composite has fallen 9.5 percent this year,
heading for a third straight annual loss, as the growth slowed
for seven quarters. Investor interest in mainland China-traded
shares has waned even as data showed signs of a growth recovery
in the world’s second-largest economy. Industrial companies’
profit accelerated 20.5 percent in October, the statistics
bureau said today, while factory output and  exports  both rose
last month by the most since May.  Share Discount  The Shanghai gauge dropped 42 percent through yesterday
since Aug. 4, 2009, when the gauge reached its highest level
since the global financial crisis. The  MSCI All-Country World
Index (MXWD)  rallied 21 percent in the same time.  The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  declined 1.2 percent to 2,150.64 today as
gauges tracking materials producers and health-care companies
both slid 2.2 percent. The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of
Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong  dropped 0.4 percent,
paring its advance this year to 6 percent.  Yuan-denominated A shares trade at their biggest discount
to their Hong Kong-listed peers since June 2011, according to an
 index  compiled by Hang Seng Bank Ltd. Mainland Chinese are
barred from directly trading overseas shares, including those on
the Hang Seng  China  Enterprises Index.  The Shanghai measure trades at 9.5 times estimated profit
for 2012, compared with the 17.7 average multiple since
Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in 2006. Thirty-day
 volatility  in gauge was at 13.6, compared with this year’s
average of 17.  Plasticizer Additive  Baotou Rare-Earth, China’s biggest producer of rare earth,
lost 4.5 percent to 31.99  yuan . Shandong Dong-E E-Jiao sank 3.1
percent to 37.12 yuan.  JiuGuiJiu tumbled the maximum 10 percent for a third
straight day, falling to 34.69 yuan. The liquor maker will
suspend all production lines to replace equipment, the Beijing
News reported, citing President Xia Xinguo. Excessive levels of
a plasticizer were found in some JiuGuiJiu samples, Xinhua News
Agency reported last week. After the market closed, the company
said it is continuing some production lines.  Policy makers have taken steps to revive confidence in the
$2.6 trillion stock market and boost economic growth. China
Securities Regulatory Commission Chairman  Guo Shuqing  has
reduced transaction fees on equity trades, urged listed
companies to pay more cash dividends and changed how initial
public offerings are priced. The government also more than
doubled allotments under the expanded the qualified foreign
institutional investor program in April to $80 billion.  ‘No Confidence’  These steps aren’t enough to lure investors back to
equities, according to Jingxi Investment Management Co.’s  Wang Zheng .  “Investors have no confidence in long-term growth
prospects and the government isn’t doing much to reverse the
situation,” said Wang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer
at Jingxi Investment, which manages $120 million. “Trading
values may fall even further.”  The Shanghai Composite dropped below 2,000 during intraday
trading twice last week and rallied to close above that level
amid speculation of government support. The index first broke
above 2,000 in July 2000 and tripled to 6,092.06 on Oct. 16,
2007, according to data compiled by Bloomberg dating to 1991.  The gauge has fallen 1.9 percent since new leaders were
named by the ruling Communist Party Nov. 15 amid concern they
will fail to accelerate the pace of measures to liberalize the
world’s second-largest economy.  Reserve Ratios  China’s stocks will “regain stability” by the first
quarter of 2013 because of growth-inducing policies by the new
leadership, improvements in macro conditions and recovery in the
U.S., Chongkyu Juhn, a strategist at Samsung Securities Co.,
wrote in a note to clients. The Shanghai Composite will trade in
the 2,000-2,400 range, he wrote.  The Shanghai gauge slid to 1,995.17 on Nov. 21 before
rallying to close 1.1 percent higher at 2,030.32 amid
speculation the People’s Bank of China will cut banks’ reserve
ratios,  Li Jun , a strategist at Central China Securities Co.,
said that day.  The measure sank to an intraday low of 1,995.72 on Nov. 19
and rallied in the final hour of trading to close 0.1 percent
higher, which may have been spurred by government buying,
according to Auerbach Grayson & Co.  The gauge breached 2,000 for less than two minutes during
trading on Sept. 26 before rising 4.1 percent in the two days
that followed. The Shanghai Securities News reported Sept. 27
there was speculation the China Securities Regulatory Commission
would announce measures to boost stocks.  --Zhang Shidong. Editors: Richard Frost, Darren Boey  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
