Constellation Energy Group Inc. shut
the 873-megawatt Calvert Cliffs 1 reactor in  Maryland  for
unplanned work on control element assemblies.  Extensive monitoring at  the unit , which slowed to 45
percent of capacity early today and halted as of 8:37 a.m,,
showed “traces of electrical noise” with one of the coils in
the No. 37 assembly, said Kory Raftery, a plant spokesman. Crews
are replacing the coils and conducting more tests on all
assembly equipment, he said.  “We need to make sure our operators can control every
piece of equipment at the plant,” Raftery, who is based at the
plant, said in a phone interview today.  Constellation has been monitoring electrical coils at Unit
1 since the summer, when the equipment failed and caused a
reduction in output, Raftery said. The coils hold up control
rods and allow operators to insert those rods into the core to
slow or boost output.  Calvert Cliffs Unit 2 continues to operate at full power.
The plant is about 38 miles (61 kilometers) south of Annapolis,
Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
