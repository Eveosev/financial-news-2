OAO Lukoil’s profit surged in the
third quarter, beating estimates, as the second-largest Russian
oil producer halted output declines and benefited from export
taxes that lagged price growth.  Net income rose 56 percent to $3.51 billion from $2.24
billion a year earlier, the Moscow-based company said in a
regulatory filing today. Earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization climbed 18 percent to $5.44
billion, beating the $4.68 billion average estimate of nine
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Lukoil has been reviving domestic crude  output  growth since
April after a three-year decline caused by reduced spending and
lower production at a northern field. Increases in export duties
failed to match crude and product price gains in the third
quarter.  Crude and gas output, including international projects,
rose 1.4 percent to 2.16 million barrels a day from a year
earlier. Free cash flow reached $4.76 billion in the first nine
months of the year.  “It’s very difficult to generate growth and cash
simultaneously in the Russian oil sector and with upstream
growth returning Lukoil is beginning to do both,” Dmitry Loukashov, an oil and gas analyst at VTB Capital in Moscow, said
by e-mail.  Sales rose 2.7 percent to $35.5 billion, Lukoil said.
Capital spending totaled $8.1 billion in the year through
September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
