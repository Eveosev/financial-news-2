Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power Co. is
investigating how an alarm was wrongly programmed and went off
yesterday at a reactor under maintenance in the Uljin nuclear
plant.  The safety alarm at a pressurizer in reactor No. 6 rang at
around 1 a.m. yesterday, the Seoul-based company said in an e-
mailed response to Bloomberg. The alarm was caused by a wrongly
programmed alert ceiling, rather than mechanical or human
operational failure, it said.  The operator and the Nuclear Safety and Security Committee
will determine a restart date of the reactor after completing
the investigation, it said, without giving an estimated
timeline. The 1,000-megawatt reactor is off-line for planned
maintenance until Nov. 30, according to its  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
