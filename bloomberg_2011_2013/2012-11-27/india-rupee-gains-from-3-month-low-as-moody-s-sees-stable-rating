India ’s rupee rose, after reaching
the lowest level in almost three months yesterday, as Moody’s
Investors Service maintained its stable outlook on the nation’s
investment-grade credit rating.  The currency halted a five-day slide after Moody’s said
yesterday India’s Baa3 ranking is supported by economic growth
and investment that’s more than emerging-market averages. Asian
currencies strengthened after European finance ministers eased
terms on emergency aid for  Greece  and cleared the way for a 34.4
billion euro ($44.7 billion) loan installment.  “It’s a slight rebound on risk appetite in the short term
that’s probably not sustainable,” said Abhishek Chauhan, a
currency analyst at Edelweiss Financial Advisors in Mumbai.
Month-end dollar demand from oil refiners and fiscal-deficit
concerns may be a drag on the rupee’s outlook, he said.  The rupee gained 0.1 percent to 55.6850 per dollar as of
10:14 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It touched 55.8825 yesterday, the weakest level since Sept. 6.
The currency may trade between 55.50 and 56.00 over the next two
weeks, Chauhan said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in exchange-rates used to price options, was unchanged at 9.50
percent.  India’s economy  may have  expanded  5.5 percent in the three
months through September from a year earlier, Finance Minister
Palaniappan Chidambaram predicted on Nov. 24, matching the
growth rate in the preceding quarter. Economists forecast a 5.2
percent increase in gross domestic product, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before data due Nov. 30.  Moody’s said the high household-savings rate and a
relatively competitive private sector will help boost growth
from 5.4 percent in the fiscal year ending March 2013 to 6
percent or higher the following year. The fiscal deficit remains
a hindrance to a rating upgrade, it said.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards were little changed at
56.58 per dollar, compared with 56.59 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts
advanced 0.3 percent to 56.49. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts
are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
