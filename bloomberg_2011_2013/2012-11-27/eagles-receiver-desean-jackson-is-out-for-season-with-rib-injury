Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver
 DeSean Jackson  won’t play again this season after fracturing
multiple ribs in last night’s 30-22 loss to the Carolina
Panthers.  Jackson was placed on injured reserve, Eagles coach  Andy Reid  said today in a news conference. The team said on its
website the injury will end the 25-year-old receiver’s season.  Jackson, who left yesterday’s game in the first half, is
leading the team in receptions, with 45, and yards receiving,
with 700. His 15.6 yards per reception and 63.6 yards per game
averages this year are both his lowest since his rookie season
in 2008.  The Eagles have lost seven consecutive games and fallen to
3-8. Philadelphia quarterback Michael Vick and running back
LeSean McCoy didn’t play last night as they recover from
concussions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
