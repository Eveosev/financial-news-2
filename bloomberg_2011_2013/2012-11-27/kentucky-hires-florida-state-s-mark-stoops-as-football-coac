The  University of Kentucky  hired
Florida State defensive coordinator Mark Stoops to replace Joker Phillips as coach of a football program that went 2-10 this
season, the school’s worst record since 1994.  Stoops, 45, has spent the past four seasons at Florida
State, which is 11-1 this season and has allowed the seventh-
fewest points at college football’s top level. This is his first
head coaching job, having also been an assistant at  Arizona ,
Miami, Houston, Wyoming and  South Florida .  Stoops is the younger brother of University of Oklahoma
coach Bob Stoops and former Arizona coach Mike Stoops, who is
the defensive coordinator at Oklahoma. His oldest brother, Ron,
is an assistant at Youngstown State in Ohio.  “Our desire to get better defensively and continue to
expand our recruiting base helped guide us to Mark,” Kentucky
Athletic Director Mitch Barnhart said in a  statement . “He comes
from a coaching family and has been in big games and big
atmospheres throughout his career.”  Kentucky fired Phillips on Nov. 4, a day after the Wildcats
were beaten by Vanderbilt University 40-0 to fall to 1-9. The
Wildcats finished the season with an 0-8 record against
Southeastern Conference opponents.  The Kentucky job was one of four football coaching
vacancies in the conference, which has won the past six college
football national championships. Arkansas fired John L. Smith
over the weekend, Auburn is seeking a replacement for Gene
Chizik and  Tennessee  dismissed Derek Dooley.  To contact the reporter on this story:
