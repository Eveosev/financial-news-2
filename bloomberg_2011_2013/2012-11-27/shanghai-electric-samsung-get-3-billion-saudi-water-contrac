A group of companies led by  Shanghai
Electric Group Co. (2727)  and  Samsung Engineering Co. (028050)  won a 11.3
billion-riyal ($3 billion) contract to build a desalination
plant on the Red Sea coast in  Saudi Arabia .  The contract for the 550,000 cubic meter a day facility,
known as Yanbu III, was awarded by the  Saline Water Conversion
Corp. , according to a statement on the Riyadh-based company’s
website. Saudi Al Toukhi Co. for Industry, Trading and
Contracting is also part of the group.  Saudi Arabia, the world’s largest user of desalinated
water, is increasing its water facilities to meet rising demand
in the kingdom. State-owned National Water Co. plans to spend
$66 billion on plants and upgrades over the next 10 years.  The Yanbu plant will have a power capacity of 2,500
megawatts, SWCC said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
