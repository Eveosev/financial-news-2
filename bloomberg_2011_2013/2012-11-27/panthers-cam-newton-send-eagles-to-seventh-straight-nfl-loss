Cam Newton threw two touchdown
passes and also ran for two scores as the  Carolina Panthers  won
30-22 in Philadelphia, sending the Eagles to their seventh
consecutive National Football League loss.  The Panthers outscored the Eagles 9-0 in the fourth quarter
last night at Lincoln Financial Field to erase a 22-21 deficit
and improve to 3-8 on the season. It was Carolina’s second
victory in its past nine games.  “We’ve just got to get that swagger back, get that
confidence back and finish the season strong,” Newton, who
finished with 306 passing yards and ran for 52 more on 14
carries, said in a televised interview.  The Eagles slumped to 3-8 and their losing skid is their
longest since dropping the final seven games of the 1994 season.  Rookie running back Bryce Brown rushed for 178 yards and
two touchdowns for Philadelphia, yet also had two of the Eagles’
three fumbles. The Eagles also lost wide receiver  DeSean Jackson 
in the first quarter with a chest injury.  Newton helped the Panthers jump out to a 14-3 first-quarter
lead with a 24-yard touchdown pass to Gary Barnidge and a 43-
yard scoring toss to Brandon Lafell.  Newton added a 1-yard touchdown run midway through the
third quarter after the Eagles fought back to take a 15-14 lead
and scored from two yards out with four minutes, 40 seconds to
play to push the Panthers’ advantage to 30-22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
