India ’s 10-year bonds gained for a
second day, pushing the yield to a one-week low, on speculation
the central bank will resume open-market debt purchases to help
ease a cash squeeze.  Local lenders borrowed an  average  917 billion rupees ($16.5
billion) a day from the central bank so far this month to meet
shortages, compared with 671 billion rupees in October, official
data show. The Reserve Bank of India, which has bought 820
billion rupees of debt since April 1 to boost the availability
of funds, last held an auction to purchase securities in June.  “Bonds have advanced due to expectations of purchases by
the RBI,” said Rajeev Radhakrishnan, a fund manager in Mumbai
SBI Funds Management Pvt. “Liquidity is tight and the pressure
could be aggravated by tax payments by companies next month.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent government notes due June
2022 was 8.196 percent as of 9:45 a.m. in Mumbai, compared with
8.203 percent yesterday, according to the central bank’s trading
system. The rate dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, yesterday, the most since Sept. 5.  RBI Deputy Governor H.R. Khan said on Nov. 25 that the
central bank will act if the cash squeeze persisted.  The one-year interest-rate swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, was little
changed at 7.76 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
