The  Bank of Canada  may need to raise
its benchmark lending rate by the second half of next year to
avoid inflation, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development said.  While growth will remain “moderate” until the middle of
2013, “economic slack is not large,” the OECD said in an
economic outlook released today.  The agency projects the world’s 11th largest economy will
grow 2.0 percent this year, followed by 1.8 percent next year
and 2.4 percent in 2014. “Given the central projection, the
Bank should begin to tighten in the latter half of 2013,” the
OECD said in its report.  Canadian  household debt  has surged to a record amid low
interest rates, prompting policy makers to warn of risks to the
country’s financial system.  The OECD said the tightening of mortgage-insurance rules by
the government in June will cool  house prices . “If housing-
market imbalances worsen, the government should respond with
further macro-prudential measures,” the OECD said, referring to
regulatory steps rather than monetary action.  To contact the reporter on this story:
