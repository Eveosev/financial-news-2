Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  said it’s
collecting seismic data in the Orange Basin off the north-west
coast of South Africa.  “We hope to make a decision on drilling in the next year
or so, but won’t if we don’t find any suitable structures,” Jan
Willem Eggink, general manager for upstream operations at Shell
in South Africa, said yesterday in an interview in Cape Town.
Shell won exploration rights to the block in February.  “The deep-water portion of the Orange Basin has evidence
of source rocks which have the potential for significant
commercial oil and gas discoveries,” the company said in a Feb.
10 statement.  The area is close to the border of  Namibia  in water ranging
from 500 meters (1,640 feet) to 3,000 meters in depth, according
to Eggink.  To contact the reporter on this story:
