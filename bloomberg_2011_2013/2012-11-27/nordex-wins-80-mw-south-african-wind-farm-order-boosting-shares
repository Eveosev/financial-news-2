Nordex SE (NDX1)  surged the most in two
weeks in Frankfurt trading after the German wind turbine maker
won an order to build an 80-megawatt power plant in  South
Africa .  Nordex rose as much as 6.5 percent, the steepest intraday
gain since Nov. 13, after it said in a statement it will install
32 of its 2.5-megawatt machines at the Red Cap Kouga project.  Nordex will provide road access, lay cables and erect a
transformer station from April, the Hamburg-based company said.
The plant, to be operated by Red Cap Kouga Wind Farm Pty, will
begin producing power in 2014, Nordex said, without valuing the
order.  The shares were 3.4 percent higher at 3.079 euros as of
1:01 p.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
