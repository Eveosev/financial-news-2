Thailand  is set to overtake India as
the world’s largest rice exporter as the nation accelerates
sales from state stockpiles, adding to record global supplies,
according to the International Rice Research Institute.  Shipments from India may drop to as low as 7 million metric
tons in the year that began Oct. 1, said Samarendu Mohanty, a
senior economist. Exports including the aromatic basmati variety
more than tripled to 10.4 million tons the previous year, said
the  U.S. Department of Agriculture . Thailand plans to  ship  8.5
million tons in 2013 from 7.3 million tons this year, according
to the Department of  Foreign Trade .  Rising Thai supplies may increase competition among Asian
producers and pressure prices that have risen 1 percent in
Chicago this year. A decline in the staple for half the world
may further lower food costs that the  United Nations ’ Food &
Agriculture Organization estimates dropped 0.9 percent in
October from a six-month high. Global opening stockpiles for
2012-2013 will climb to the highest in a decade, the USDA says.  “Thailand has little choice but to release stocks and that
will probably lead to lower prices,”  Concepcion Calpe , a senior
economist at the FAO, said from  Rome . “There will be growing
competition from less important rice-supplying countries, such
as Brazil, Russia,  Egypt  and Australia in the export markets,
which will tend to reduce prices in 2013.”  Thai Reserves  Thailand’s stockpiles are poised to climb to a record 12.1
million tons by the end of 2012-2013 from 9.8 million tons a
year earlier, the USDA estimates. The country will be forced to
sell some of the rice it bought from farmers to make space for
the new harvest, said Mohanty.  “High stockpiles may force Thailand to sell rice at a
cheaper rate in the global market,” Mohanty said. “The world
market is already flooded with rice and if Thailand sells below
cost, that will weaken prices further.”  Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra implemented a price-
support policy to boost incomes of farmers who helped her Pheu
Thai party win an election last year. The government guaranteed
as much as 15,000 baht ($489) a ton for unmilled white rice,
about 50 percent more than local market rates, and 20,000 baht
for a higher-quality variety.  India  is set to export 7.25 million tons in 2012-2013 and
Thailand will ship 8 million tons, USDA data show.  Vietnam  may
sell 7 million tons, becoming the third-biggest shipper.  The free-on-board price of 25 percent broken long-grain
white rice in Thailand costs as much as $540 a ton compared with
$385 in India, said Vijay Setia, former president of the All
India Rice Exporters’ Association. Most Indian rice exports are
the 25 percent broken variety, he said.  January-delivery contract rose 0.6 percent to $15.015 per
100 pounds at 3:42 p.m. Mumbai time on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Prices climbed to a three-year high of $18.37 in
September last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
