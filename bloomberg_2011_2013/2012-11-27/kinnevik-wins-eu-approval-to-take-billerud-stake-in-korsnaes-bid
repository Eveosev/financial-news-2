Investment AB Kinnevik (KINVB)  won European
Union approval to take a stake in  Billerud AB (BILL)  after it agreed to
sell a paper machine.  Kinnevik sought EU authorization to take the stake as part
of the sale of its packaging unit Korsnaes to Billerud,  Europe ’s
second-largest manufacturer of sack paper. It offered to divest
a Korsnaes machine along with related assets and personnel
making all of the unit’s white sack kraft paper. It will also
offer supply deals to the machine’s purchaser.  Billerud agreed to buy Korsnaes stock from Kinnevik and
issue 2 billion kronor ($300 million) of new shares to help
finance the transaction, it said in June. Kinnevik will get 3.2
billion kronor in cash and 25.1 percent of the votes in
Billerud, it said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
