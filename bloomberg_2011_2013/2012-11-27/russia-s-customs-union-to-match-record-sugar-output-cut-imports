Sugar output from domestically grown
sugar beets in Russia, Belarus and  Kazakhstan , members of a
customs union, will match last year’s record 5.3 million metric
tons in 2012, the union’s managing body said.  The need for imported raw-sugar is “falling to a
minimum,” the Eurasian Economic Commission, which governs the
customs union, said in a  statement  today. Imports are expected
to be no more than 850,000 tons for the three states in 2013, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
