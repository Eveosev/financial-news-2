The European Central Bank should cut
interest rates further and commit to keeping them low for an
extended period as the economy weakens and the risk of deflation
grows, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
said.  “In the euro area, there is a need for easier monetary
conditions given the prospects for weak economic activity and
growing disinflationary pressures,” the Paris-based OECD said
in a report published today. “Hence, the ECB should lower its
refinancing rate by a further 25 basis points, possibly in
conjunction with a negative deposit rate, and issue forward
guidance on maintaining the accommodative policy stance for a
long period.”  In case of severe turmoil, “liquidity provisions and
broad-based purchases of assets should be expanded,” it said.  The Frankfurt-based ECB cut its benchmark interest rate to
a record low of 0.75 percent in July and took the unprecedented
step of reducing the rate it pays banks on overnight deposits to
zero. ECB President Mario Draghi has been credited with easing
the sovereign debt crisis after announcing the unlimited bond-
buying plan known as OMT in September.  The OECD warned that the euro area could face further
turmoil in the event that countries accessing the OMT scheme
fail to comply with the conditions attached and a halt in ECB
bond-buying is triggered.  “It remains to be clarified how the mechanism would
operate if there was a failure to comply with conditionality, as
interruption of support would spark financial instability in the
sovereign debt market with possible contagion effects,” it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
