The Republic of Congo will export
five Djeno crude cargoes of 920,000 barrels each in January, one
less than December, according to a loading program obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The west African nation plans to cut exports of Nâ€™Kossa
grade to one consignment of 950,000 barrels from two in
December, the schedule showed.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
