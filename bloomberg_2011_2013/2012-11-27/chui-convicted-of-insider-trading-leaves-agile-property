Citic Pacific Ltd. (267) ’s former deputy
head of finance Chui Wing Nin was jailed for 15 months and fined
HK$1 million ($129,030) by a  Hong Kong  court for  insider
trading .  Magistrate Li Kwok-wai sentenced Chui yesterday to 18
months in prison, less one month in recognition of his personal
character and two months for the delay of the trial. He also
ordered Chui to pay about HK$229,000 in costs.  Chui, who left Citic Pacific for  Agile Property Holdings
Ltd. (3383)  in 2010, was convicted on Oct. 26 of two counts of selling
shares in the Chinese steelmaker in 2008 before the company
issued a public statement disclosing potential losses of as much
as HK$15.5 billion from wrong-way currency bets. He left Agile
on the day of his conviction, according to a statement from the
company’s representatives.  Citic Pacific, controlled by  China ’s biggest state-owned
investment company, fell 55 percent on Oct. 22, 2008 after its
announcement. Chui sold a total of 81,000 shares on Sept. 9 and
Sept. 12 and avoided losses of as much as HK$1.36 million,
according to Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission.  Chui’s lawyer Joseph Tse said his client had not decided if
he will appeal the sentence.  Chui worked at Citic Pacific until June 30, 2010, according
to the SFC. He joined Agile in July 2010 to handle accounting,
corporate finance, and  investor relations .  Agile CFO  Agile has no immediate plans to appoint a new chief
financial officer to replace Chui, according to the e-mailed
statement from iPR Ogilvy, which handles public relations for
the Hong Kong-listed developer. Financial controller Janus Lui
is filling in the role, according to the statement.  Citic Pacific’s bets on the Australian dollar prompted a
bailout from its parent Citic Group, which is backed by China’s
cabinet, and the resignation of its then chairman Larry Yung.  Hong Kong’s Department of Justice said last year, during a
court hearing over disputed documents, that there was “clear
evidence” Citic Pacific defrauded four banks before Oct. 20,
2008, when it sought financing without disclosing the losses.  Citic Pacific directors acted properly, a lawyer for the
company has said. The company declined to comment yesterday,
according to Elizabeth Xu, a Hong Kong-based spokeswoman at
Brunswick Group, which handles media relations for Citic
Pacific.  Citic Pacific entered into the currency contracts to hedge
its exposure to the Australian dollar as it was developing an
iron ore mine in  Australia ’s Pilbara region.  The case is Securities and Futures Commission and Chui Wing
Nin, ESS27729/2011 in Hong Kong’s Eastern Magistrates’ Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
