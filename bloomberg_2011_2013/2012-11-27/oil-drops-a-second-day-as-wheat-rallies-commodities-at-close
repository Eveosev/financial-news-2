higher at 1,582.969.  CRUDE OIL  Oil fell for a second day as U.S. crude inventories were
forecast to increase and on concern that a deal for  Greece  to
buy back its bonds may falter.  Crude for January delivery fell 62 cents, or 0.7 percent,
to $87.12 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Prices
are down 12 percent this year.  Brent for January settlement slid $1.31, or 1.2 percent, to
$109.61 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe

said crop conditions for winter varieties were the worst in at
least 27 years after a prolonged drought left fields with little
soil moisture.  Wheat futures for March delivery rose 1.8 percent to $8.79
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, after reaching $8.82,
