Pentair Ltd. (PNR) , a water filtration and
flow-control company, said today that it expects revenue of $7.6
billion to $7.8 billion in 2013.  That compares with estimated sales next year of as much as
$8.12 billion with a median of $7.85 billion, according to 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The guidance was provided ahead
of Pentair’s annual investor and analyst day today in New York
City, led by Chief Executive Officer Randall J. Hogan.  Pentair said it “expects to continue generating free cash
flow in excess of net income for 2013” following its merger
this year with  Tyco International Ltd. (TYC) ’s flow-control business.  The company, incorporated in Switzerland for tax reasons
with its main offices in  Minneapolis , also re-affirmed adjusted
fourth-quarter 2012 earnings per share guidance of 40 cents to
45 cents. The stock has surged 44 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
