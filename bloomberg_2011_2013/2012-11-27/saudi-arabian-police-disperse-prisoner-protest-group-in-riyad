Saudi Arabian police dispersed a
small group of people today in  Riyadh  calling for the release of
prisoners.  “A group of individuals and family members gathered in
front of the Human Rights Commission,” Mohammed al-Qahtani, a
democracy advocate, said by phone from Riyadh. “They called for
the release of political detainees.”  Images posted on Twitter accounts showed police surrounding
a group of people in front of the government-run human rights
organization and two Saudi women holding a sign saying “The
People Want the Liberation of the Prisons.”  Police closed a
section of King Fahd Road today in front of the human rights
office.  Saudi Arabia has remained unscathed by the popular
uprisings in the Arab world that led to the toppling of leaders
in Tunisia, Egypt, Libya, and Yemen.  King Abdullah  spent an
additional 224 billion riyals ($60 billion) last year to create
jobs, build homes and increase salaries for members of the armed
forces.  The public affairs office of the Saudi  Interior Ministry 
declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
