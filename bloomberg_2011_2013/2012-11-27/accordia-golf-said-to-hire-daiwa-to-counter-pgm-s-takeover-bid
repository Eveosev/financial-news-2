Accordia Golf Co. (2131) , a Japanese golf
course operator, hired  Daiwa Securities Group Inc. (8601)  as a
financial adviser to counter a takeover bid by  PGM (2466)  Holdings
K.K., two people with knowledge of the situation said.  Accordia is considering several options to give
shareholders better value than the 81,000 yen ($990) a share
offer by PGM, said the people, who asked not to be named as the
discussions are private. They include bringing in a strategic
investor and raising dividends, the people said.  Shares of Accordia jumped to a 22-month high. PGM has been
seeking an acquisition to boost the scale of its golf business
as playing numbers decline in Japan. It offered to acquire as
many as 50.1 percent of Tokyo-based Accordia’s  shares  this month
for about 43 billion yen.  Accordia declined to comment in a statement e-mailed to
 Bloomberg News . Misato Kinoshita, a spokeswoman for Daiwa in
Tokyo, declined to comment, as did PGM’s Tomoko Thompson.  PGM has hired  Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s Japanese brokerage unit as a
financial adviser, Thompson said earlier today.  Accordia rose as much as 9.9 percent in Tokyo trading, and
closed 6.3 percent higher at 77,400 yen, the highest since Jan.
6, 2011. The shares have climbed 45 percent since PGM announced
its bid on Nov. 15. PGM gained 1.1 percent today to 70,800 yen.  Fewer Golfers  Accordia owns 132 golf courses, while Tokyo-based PGM has
124, according to their latest financial statements.  “It’s ideal to improve management efficiency through a
merger to support shareholders’ interests, in light of the long-
term declining trend in golf playing,” PGM said in a Nov. 15
statement. The number of  Japan ’s golfers 15 years old and over
fell to 9 million last year from 17.8 million in 1991, it said.  PGM started the takeover bid “unilaterally,” Accordia
said in a statement on Nov. 20, urging its shareholders to act
“in a careful manner.”  PGM posted 2.3 billion yen of profit for the nine months
ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of 938 million yen a year
earlier, the company said on Nov. 8. Net income at Accordia fell
56 percent to 3.7 billion yen in the six months ended Sept. 30
from a year earlier, it said in October.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  used to own Accordia, while  Lone
Star Funds  owned PGM. PGM and Accordia listed their stock after
initial public offerings in 2005 and 2006, respectively.  To contact the reporter on this story:
