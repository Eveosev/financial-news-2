Japan  plans for every household to
be equipped with a home energy management system by 2030 to
increase their  energy efficiency , a government taskforce said
today in the draft of a clean-power policy report.  Japan also plans to promote residential cogeneration fuel
cells, installing 5.3 million units by 2030, according to the
draft, which didnâ€™t say how targets will be met. Japan will have
53.4 million households in 2030, the Cabinet Secretariat says.
Cells generate heat and power from sources such as natural gas.  The country will promote research and development, and
overseas expansion in clean energy industries including solar
thermal and large-size wind turbines, the report said.  The government will seek comments from the public before
completing the report, according to the Cabinet Secretariat,
which is overseeing the administration of the taskforce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
