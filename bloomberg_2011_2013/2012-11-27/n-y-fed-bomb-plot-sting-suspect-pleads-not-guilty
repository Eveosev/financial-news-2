A Bangladeshi man arrested in a U.S.
sting operation for allegedly trying to bomb the  New York 
Federal Reserve pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges.  Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 21, entered his plea
today before Chief U.S. District Judge Carol Bagley Amon in
federal court in Brooklyn, New York. He was charged with
attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction and attempting to
provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization.
The weapon was fake and provided to Nafis by government agents.  Nafis was arrested in October after he attempted to
detonate what he believed to be a 1,000-pound bomb at the bank,
located at 33 Liberty Street in  Lower Manhattan , according to
court papers. Government agents had helped Nafis plan the would-
be attack, according to court papers.  The government is in plea negotiations with Nafis,
prosecutor James Loonam told the judge. Nafis’s lawyer, Heidi
Cesare, declined to comment after the proceedings.  Nafis came to the U.S. using a student visa and told an
informant for the FBI that he wanted to wage “jihad,”
according to a criminal complaint filed in the case. The
informant referred Nafis to an agent posing as a member of al-
Qaeda, according to the complaint.  In a video statement made just before the bombing attempt,
Nafis said “we will not stop until we attain victory or
martyrdom,” according to court papers.  The case is U.S. v. Nafis, 1:12-mj-00965, U.S. District
Court, Eastern District of New York ( Brooklyn ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
