Italy sold 3.5 billion euros ($4.5
billion) of zero-coupon bonds, the maximum set for the auction,
at the lowest yield on a similar bond since October 2010.  The Rome-based Treasury sold the 2014 zero-coupon bonds to
yield 1.923 percent, less than the 2.397 percent at the last
auction of the same securities on Oct. 26. Investors bid for 1.5
times the amount offered, compared with 1.65 last month.  Italy also sold 253 million euros of 3.1 percent inflation-
linked 2026 bonds and 747 million euros of 2.35 percent
inflation-linked bonds due in 2019. The 2026 bond was priced to
yield 3.49 percent versus 3.75 percent on Oct. 26. The 2019 bond
was sold at a yield of 2.53 percent.  Italian bond yields have declined since European Central
Bank President  Mario Draghi  vowed in July to do whatâ€™s needed to
preserve the euro and followed in September by announcing a
bond-buying program for countries facing financing stress.  To contact the reporter on this story:
