Spanish nationalized banks including
 Bankia SA (BKIA)  will have to make major cuts to their balance sheets
by order of the European Commission, said Antonio Carrascosa,
head of the government’s bank bailout fund.  “Tomorrow there will be a press release and certain
details of these plans,” Carrascosa said in a seminar in Madrid
today. “What is clear is that they suppose a significant
reduction in the  balance sheets  of companies and there will be
obligations in everything that has to do with shrinking the
balance sheet -- cuts in offices, staff and  loans .”  Spain  sealed an agreement in July to take as much as 100
billion euros ($129.6 billion) of aid from  Europe  to help
stabilize its banking system as investor concern about the
extent of loan losses threatened to further undermine confidence
in government finances. European Competition Commissioner
 Joaquin Almunia  is slated to announce in Brussels tomorrow terms
of restructuring plans for Spanish lenders set to get European
aid.  Fitch Ratings  said it expected Spanish banks that are being
bailed out to shrink in size by at least 25 percent.  “Resilient banks will take advantage of others that are
receiving state aid and shedding businesses as part of their
restructuring plans,” the ratings company said in a statement
sent by e-mail today.  Bankia, a nationalized lender that in May requested 19
billion euros from the government to clean up bad loans, said it
will announce tomorrow a new strategic plan through 2015.
Chairman Jose Ignacio Goirigolzarri told shareholders in June
the bank would seek to reduce its 60 billion euros of non-
yielding assets by more than half over three years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
