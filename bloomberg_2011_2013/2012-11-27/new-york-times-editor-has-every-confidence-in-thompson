New York Times Co. (NYT)  Executive Editor
Jill Abramson, who dispatched a team of reporters to investigate
the controversy over  Mark Thompson ’s leadership of the British
Broadcasting Corp., said she remains sanguine about his role as
chief executive officer of her company.  “I have every confidence in him as CEO of the  New York 
Times,” she said in a brief interview after a presentation at
Business Insider’s media and technology conference today.  Thompson, who came in to lead Times Co. this month, has
come under scrutiny for his management of the  BBC . He led the
broadcaster when it canceled a segment by its “Newsnight”
program investigating claims that Jimmy Savile, a popular BBC
presenter, had sexually abused dozens of underage girls over a
period of decades. Savile died last year.  Thompson appeared before a closed-door internal inquiry at
the BBC last week to testify on what he knew about the news
report and why it was canceled.  “I was not involved in any way in the decision-making
about the ‘Newsnight’ investigation into Savile,” Thompson said
in an interview last month.  Abramson said she has met with Thompson a number of times
since he joined the company.  “He’s very energetic and full of ideas,” she told
Business Insider Editor-in-Chief  Henry Blodget  at the
presentation.  At the same time, she said it isn’t her role to evaluate
his management of the company.  “We’ve done a number of lengthy enterprise pieces about
the unfolding issues in the BBC investigation,” she said.
