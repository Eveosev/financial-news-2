Former Foreign Minister  Tzipi Livni 
said she will run in Israel’s Jan. 22 election at the head of a
new party, challenging Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu  to a
rematch of their contest almost four years ago.  “I’m here to fight,” Livni said today at a Tel Aviv news
conference. “I’ve decided to provide an answer for those who
say there’s no one to vote for.”  While Livni’s Kadima party won the most parliamentary seats
in the 2009 election, Netanyahu persuaded other factions to join
a coalition led by his Likud party and went on to form a new
government.  Livni, 54, who resigned in May as opposition leader and
head of Kadima, said her new party will be called “The
Movement.” She resisted efforts by the Labor Party and others
to recruit her before making the decision to run on her own
ticket.  To contact the reporters on this story:
