Orix Corp. (8591) , a Japanese finance and
leasing company, will develop solar power plants at 17 sites
across the country with a combined capacity of 81.6 megawatts,
enough to supply about 25,100 homes.  A 17.5 megawatt plant on the northern island of Hokkaido
will be the largest and is scheduled to begin operations in
December 2014, the company said today in a  statement.   The projects are part Orix’s plan to develop a total of 100
megawatts of solar power over three years on land leased from
companies and local governments, according to the statement. It
plans to develop another 100 megawatts in three years by renting
roofs of large facilities owned by companies and governments.  The company didn’t disclose financial terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
