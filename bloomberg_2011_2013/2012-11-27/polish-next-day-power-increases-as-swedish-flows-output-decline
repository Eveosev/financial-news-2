Polish day-ahead electricity 
increased for a third day amid lower supply from  Sweden  and
unplanned output reductions at domestic plants.  Next-day power in Poland gained 5.9 percent to 192.81 zloty
($60.85) a megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Electricity flows via the undersea cable from Sweden were
set to be cut by 50 percent to 300 megawatts from 9 a.m. to 8
p.m. Stockholm time tomorrow due to maintenance, grid company
Svenska Kraftnaet AB said in a filing to the Nord Pool Spot AS
exchange. The link predominantly supplies Poland with cheaper
Nordic hydropower output. Meanwhile,  GDF Suez SA (GSZ)  and  Enea SA (ENA) 
were set to have 485 megawatts of Polish power capacity halted
tomorrow, data on company websites showed.  Next-day electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia advanced 4 percent to 54.74 euros ($70.78)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countriesâ€™
market operators. The day-ahead contract in  Hungary  settled 3.9
percent higher, also at 54.74 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
