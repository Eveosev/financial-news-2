Spain  sold 4.09 billion euros ($5.3
billion) of bills, beating its maximum target, and its borrowing
costs fell after European finance ministers agreed to ease the
terms on  Greece ’s aid program.  The Treasury in  Madrid , which set an upper goal for the
sale of 4 billion euros, sold three-month bills today at an
average 1.254 percent, compared with 1.415 percent on Oct. 23,
and six-month debt at 1.669 percent, down from 2.023 percent.  Demand for the three-month debt was 3.52 times the amount
sold, compared with 4.32 last month, and the ratio rose to 2.3
from 1.99 on the longer-dated securities, the Treasury said.  Spain has already sold all the bonds it planned to auction
this year and is building a funding buffer for 2013 as Prime
Minister  Mariano Rajoy  tries to avoid a European bailout.
European finance ministers’ move today to loosen the terms on
Greece’s bailout loans, the latest effort to keep the nation in
the euro, eased pressure on Spanish bond yields.  Spain’s 10-year benchmark bond yield fell to 5.614 percent
at 10:45 a.m. in Madrid from 5.62 percent yesterday. That
compares with a euro-era record of 7.75 percent on July 25,
before European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  offered to
buy the bonds of euro nations that sign up to a bailout from the
euro-region’s government-led bailout fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
