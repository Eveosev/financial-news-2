ViewSonic Corp., a maker of visual-
display products, was sued by a consumer who contends the
company wrongly sold computer monitors while knowing they
contained defective parts and would fail prematurely.  Robert Theis of San Francisco, who said he bought a liquid-
crystal display monitor that failed, alleges that ViewSonic was
aware of defective capacitors that sometimes overheat and cause
the units to break down before they should. The company should
reimburse purchasers and pay punitive damages, according to a
complaint he filed yesterday in federal court in  Delaware .  ViewSonic “has failed to recall the defective monitors
publicly in order to cure the design defect,” Theis said in his
complaint. He accused the company of breach of warranty,
deceptive trade practices, consumer fraud and unjust enrichment.  The company, which provides displays for computers,
tablets, signs and smartphones, sold the defective monitors for
$150 to more than $1,200, according to Theis’s filing.  Jeff Volpe, president of Walnut, California-based ViewSonic
didn’t immediately return a phone message seeking comment on the
lawsuit’s allegations.  The case is Theis v. ViewSonic, 12-cv-1569, U.S. District
Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
