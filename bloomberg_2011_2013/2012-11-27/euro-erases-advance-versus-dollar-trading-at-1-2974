The euro erased an advance versus
the dollar after Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President
Richard W. Fisher said accommodative policies canâ€™t be left in
place forever and limits should be set on U.S. quantitative
easing, boosting demand for the U.S. currency.  The euro was little changed at $1.2974 at 8:35 a.m. London
time after rising as much as 0.3 percent to $1.3009, the highest
in three weeks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
