The U.K. opposition  Labour Party ’s
business spokesman will call for tighter rules on takeovers,
saying their value is often unclear and that they should be
harder to engineer.  “Though estimates vary, few who have looked at this issue
systematically put the share of genuine takeover success stories
above 50 percent,” Chuka Umunna will tell a business breakfast
hosted by the  Association of British Insurers  in London today.
“There is, I believe, a strong case for more grit in the
machine. Not necessarily to stop takeovers, but to stop the rush
to takeover.”  Umunna will say he wants to look at whether current rules
encourage bids supported by “excessive debt,” creating
difficulties for the companies later on. He’ll also say the
“financial stability” category of takeover, created to allow
Lloyds TSB Group Plc’s rescue of HBOS Plc in 2008, should be
abolished.  Umunna will cite the acquisition of Cadbury Plc by Kraft
Foods Inc. of the U.S. as an example of a takeover that
shouldn’t have happened, though he will say he doesn’t believe
bids should be evaluated on the basis of where companies have
their headquarters.  To contact the reporter on this story:
