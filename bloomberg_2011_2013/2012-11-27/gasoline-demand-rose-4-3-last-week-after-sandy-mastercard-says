U.S. gasoline demand rose 4.3
percent last week as Americans traveled for the Thanksgiving
holiday and East Coast gas stations reopened after  Hurricane
Sandy , according to data from  MasterCard Inc. (MA)   Drivers bought 8.83 million barrels a day of gasoline in
the week ended Nov. 23, up from 8.46 million the prior week,
MasterCard’s SpendingPulse report showed.  The gain follows an increase of 0.9 percent in the seven
days ended Nov. 16. Sandy, the largest tropical storm on record
in the Atlantic, made landfall in New Jersey on Oct. 29,
disrupting production and distribution in the mid-Atlantic area,
including the  New York  metro area, and sending demand to the
lowest since March in the week ended Nov. 9.  The four-week average was 2.9 percent below a year earlier
in the week ended Nov. 23. It has been down from the previous
year every week except one since March 18, 2011. Year-to-date
fuel consumption is 3.6 percent below the same period in 2011.  The lowest demand this year through Oct. 26 was 8.01
million barrels on Feb. 10. The highest level reached was 9.36
million on May 25.  The average pump price fell 1 cent in the past week to
$3.43 a gallon, the cheapest since the week ended July 20, the
report showed. Drivers are paying 2.7 percent more than a year
earlier. Prices reached a year-to-date peak of $3.94 on April 6.  The report from Purchase, New York-based MasterCard is
assembled by MasterCard Advisors, the company’s consulting arm.
The information is based on credit-card swipes and cash and
check payments at about 140,000 U.S. gasoline stations.  Visa Inc. (V)  is the biggest payments network company by
transactions processed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
