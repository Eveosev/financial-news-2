New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is requesting information from charities on
fundraising related to  Hurricane Sandy  to ensure that money is
spent on storm relief.  The attorney general’s office sent letters to 75 nonprofit
groups requesting information on their fundraising and relief
activities, Schneiderman said today in a statement. The office’s
charities bureau will compile the information and report it
online.  “In light of the importance of the recovery efforts, and
the enormous amount of money raised in such a short period of
time, it is critical that donors know where their money is
going, and that funds are spent responsibly,” Schneiderman
said.  The charities include the American Red Cross, Catholic
Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, City Harvest, Habitat
for Humanity International, the Jewish Federations of North
America Inc., Robin Hood Foundation and United Way of New York
City.  The attorney general’s office on Nov. 15 said it notified
13 gas-station operators of plans to bring enforcement actions
against them for alleged price-gouging after Sandy. Schneiderman
is also investigating utility providers Long Island Power
Authority and  Consolidated Edison Inc. (ED)  over their preparedness
and response to the storm.  To contact the reporter on this story:
