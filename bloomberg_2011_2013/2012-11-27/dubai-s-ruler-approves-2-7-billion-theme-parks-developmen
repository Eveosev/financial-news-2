Dubai’s ruler approved building five
theme parks valued at 10 billion dirhams ($2.7 billion) three
days after he announced the development of a new district that
includes the world’s biggest shopping mall and gardens bigger
than  London ’s Hyde Park.  Meraas Holding, a Dubai-based real estate developer, will
build Dubai Adventures Studios on 30 million square feet (2.8
square kilometers), according to a statement on Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s  website . The first phase of the project
was announced in December 2011.  Dubai is reviving developments that stalled after the
 property market  crashed starting in 2008. The emirate, which
already has the world’s largest mall and the tallest skyscraper,
racked up $113 billion of debt making itself into a business and
tourism hub. About $7 billion of the debt matures next year and
$32 million in 2014, Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in an
October report.  Dubai Adventure Studios “set to host popular Hollywood
brands” will anchor the project, according to the statement. It
will include a Bollywood Park to show Indian movies and theater
productions as well as an aquatic and marine life park and a
destination for toddlers. Dubai aims to attract 16 million
visitors to the development every year once the first phase is
completed in 2014, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
