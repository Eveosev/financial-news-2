South Korea’s current-account
surplus narrowed to a two-month low after imports of machinery
and equipment increased.  The  surplus  was $5.8 billion last month, compared with a
revised excess of $5.9 billion in September, the  Bank of Korea 
said in a statement in  Seoul  today. The current account is the
broadest measure of trade, tracking goods, services and
investment income.  South Korean officials announced measures yesterday to
tighten limits on banks’ currency forward positions as gains in
the won threaten to curtail a rebound in exports. The nation’s
current-account surplus will help support further appreciation
of the currency, said Wai Ho Leong, a Singapore-based economist
at Barclays Plc.  “The latest regulation is seen as more of a speed bump,
not a road block,” Leong said before the data was released.
Barclays forecasts the currency will reach 1,050 won per dollar
within 12 months, he said.  The won,  Asia ’s best performing currency in the second half
of the year, strengthened 0.1 percent to 1,084.08 per dollar at
the close yesterday in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. It reached 1,080.05 on Nov. 22, the highest level
since Sept. 9, 2011. The  Kospi (KOSPI)  index of stocks climbed 0.9
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
