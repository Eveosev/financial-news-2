European Union carbon permits were
little changed, giving up earlier losses as nations prepare to
resume talks in two days on a stop-gap plan to tackle a glut,
according to an EU document.  EU permits for December rose 1 cent to close at 6.85 euros
($8.86) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London . They earlier fell 2.6 percent to the lowest since Nov.
22. Factories and power stations in the EU program can use a
limited portion of United Nations offset credits as a cheaper
form of compliance. Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December rose 2 cents to 76 cents a ton.  Representatives of national governments in Brussels will
examine on Nov. 29 a draft change to the EU emissions trading
law that would enable delaying some auctions of carbon permits,
according to the draft EU document obtained by Bloomberg News.
They will also discuss six potential long-term scenarios to
improve the worldâ€™s biggest cap-and-trade program set out by the
European Commission in a strategy paper on Nov. 14, the document
showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
