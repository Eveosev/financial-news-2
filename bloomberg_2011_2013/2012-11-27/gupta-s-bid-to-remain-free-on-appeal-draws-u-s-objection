Rajat Gupta , the former  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  director found guilty in an insider-trading
probe, shouldn’t be allowed to delay going to prison while he
appeals his conviction, U.S. prosecutors said.  U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan last month
sentenced Gupta to two years in prison, directing him to begin
his term on Jan. 8 and rejecting his request to remain free
pending appeal. Gupta then asked the  U.S. Court of Appeals  to
postpone his surrender date. Prosecutors objected in a court
filing yesterday.  Rakoff “correctly determined that Gupta had not identified
a substantial issue of law or fact that would likely result in
reversal of his conviction or a new trial,” prosecutors said in
the filing. They said Rakoff didn’t abuse his discretion in
admitting as evidence wiretapped recordings of Gupta speaking on
telephone calls with Galleon Group LLC co-founder Raj
Rajaratnam.  Gupta, 63, was convicted by a jury in June of one count of
conspiracy and three counts of  securities fraud . He was accused
of passing illegal information about New York-based Goldman
Sachs to Rajaratnam, his friend and business partner.  Rakoff said at sentencing that he would recommend to U.S.
Bureau of Prisons officials that Gupta serve his term at the
federal prison in Otisville,  New York .  The case is U.S. v. Gupta, 12-4448, U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
