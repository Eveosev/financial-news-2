Nationwide Building Society , the
U.K.’s largest customer-owned lender, said half-year pretax
profit fell 48 percent, hurt by losses on commercial property
loans and claims linked to the mis-selling of loan insurance.  Pretax profit declined to 124 million pounds ($199 million)
in the six months to September 30 from 238 million pounds in the
year-earlier period, the lender said in a statement today.
Profit was reduced by a 193 million-pound impairment on
commercial property and a 45 million-pound charge for
compensating clients sold payment-protection insurance they
didn’t need.  “Our results for the period have been affected by losses
on lending to the commercial property sector,” the Swindon,
England-based company said in the statement. “This lending was
almost exclusively undertaken in the period up to 2008, when the
credit crisis and subsequent recession led to severe falls in
commercial property valuations.”  Mortgage lending in the period climbed to the highest in
four years, with gross lending climbing 15 percent to 10.2
billion pounds, the company said. First-time buyers borrowed
about 2.5 billion pounds, more than twice the amount in the
year-earlier period, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
