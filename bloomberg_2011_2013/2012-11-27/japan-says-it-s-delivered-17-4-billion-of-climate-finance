Japan  has delivered $17.4 billion of
so-called fast-start finance to developing nations for projects
that fight and mitigate the impact of climate change, the
nation’s ambassador for environmental issues said.  Masahiko Horie, speaking at a briefing at United Nations
global warming talks in Doha, said the sum exceeded the $15
billion the government pledged in 2010. The spending covers both
public and private funds invested through Oct. 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
