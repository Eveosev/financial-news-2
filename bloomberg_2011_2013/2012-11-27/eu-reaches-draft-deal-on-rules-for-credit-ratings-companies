Credit-ratings companies face curbs
on when they can assess government debt and restrictions on
their ownership under draft plans agreed on by European Union
officials and legislators.  Lawmakers from the European Parliament and Cyprus, which
holds the rotating presidency of the EU, also agreed to allow
investors to sue ratings companies if they lose money because of
their malpractice or gross negligence, according Stefaan De
Rynck, a spokesman for EU Financial Services Chief Michel
Barnier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
