China Longyuan Power Group Corp. (916) ,
the nation’s biggest developer of wind farms, started operating
a 150-megawatt venture off the eastern province of Jiangsu.  The project, China’s largest sea-based wind farm, will
raise Longyuan’s offshore capacity in Rudong county to 182
megawatts, after 32 megawatts were completed in 2010, the
company said in a  statement  yesterday. It can sell the power at
0.778  yuan  (13 cents) a kilowatt-hour.  China has a target to install 5,000 megawatts of offshore
wind farms by 2015 as it seeks to meet growing energy demand
without adding to emissions. Projects planned by Beijing-based
Longyuan will account for a fifth of that goal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
