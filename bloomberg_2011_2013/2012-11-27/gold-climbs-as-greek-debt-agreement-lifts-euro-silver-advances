Gold fell the most in a week as
physical demand from  India , last year’s biggest buyer, remained
slack and a rebounding dollar eroded the appeal of the metal as
an alternative investment.  Buying in India has “retreated,” UBS AG wrote today in a
report. The U.S. Dollar Index extended gains after a report
showed U.S. demand for goods such as machinery and electronics
climbed in October by the most in five months. While gold rose
5.1 percent in September after the  Federal Reserve  announced
stimulus measures to boost growth, such accommodative policies
can’t be left in place forever, Fed Bank of Dallas President
Richard W. Fisher said today in Berlin.  “The dollar strength is working against gold,” Ronald Stoeferle, a commodity analyst at Erste Group Bank AG in Vienna,
said in a telephone interview. “Also, the physical market looks
quiet.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to
settle at $1,742.30 an ounce at 1:44 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York , the biggest decline since Nov. 20. Prices dropped 0.1
percent yesterday, after reaching $1,755 on Nov. 23, the highest
since Oct. 17.  Holdings in gold-backed  exchange-traded products  rose 0.7
metric ton to a record 2,607 tons yesterday, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for March delivery slid 0.5 percent to
$34.074 an ounce in New York, after reaching $34.37, the highest
since Oct. 11.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
January delivery rose 0.5 percent to settle at $1,618.50 an
ounce. Palladium futures for December delivery climbed 1.1
percent to $668.20 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
