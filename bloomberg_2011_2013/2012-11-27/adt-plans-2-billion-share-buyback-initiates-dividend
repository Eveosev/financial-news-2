ADT Corp. (ADT)  authorized a $2 billion
share repurchase program and initiated a quarterly dividend
after investors  George Soros  and hedge-fund manager Keith Meister called on the home-security company to buy back stock.  The quarterly dividend will amount to 12.5 cents a share,
payable Dec. 18 to shareholders of record on Dec. 10, the  Boca
Raton , Florida-based company said in a statement today. The
buyback will end in November 2015.  In October, billionaire Soros joined Meister in urging ADT
to buy back about 45 percent of its stock with borrowed money to
take advantage of low  interest rates . At the time, they were the
biggest investors in the company following its spinoff from  Tyco
International Ltd. (TYC)  in September.  ADT today reported adjusted earnings per share of 43 cents
in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 28, matching the average
analyst  estimate . Recurring revenue rose 5.2 percent to $742
million.  The company has more than 6 million customers in the U.S.
and Canada, providing security to homes and businesses with
products including the ADT Pulse system. The company today
predicted that recurring revenue will grow by 4.9 percent to 5.2
percent in the current fiscal year.  “We delivered solid recurring revenue growth fueled by the
continued success of Pulse in the residential and small business
security markets,” Chief Executive Officer Naren Gursahaney
said in the statement.  ADT forecast a cash tax rate of 3 percent to 4 percent in
2013, down from 5 percent a year earlier, as the company applies
a loss carry-forward balance. From 2014 to 2019, the expected
cash tax rate is 5 percent to 8 percent before rising to 25
percent to 30 percent in 2021 to 2022, the company said in an
earnings  slide presentation  on its website.  The shares rose 3 percent to $44.39 at 9:52 a.m.  New York 
time after increasing to an intraday record of $45.  To contact the reporters on this story:
