The following is the text of
Canada’s financial statistics report for the third quarter
released by  Statistics Canada .  Canadian corporations earned $72.2 billion in operating
profits in the third quarter, up 3.7% from the previous quarter.
This increase follows a 7.0% decrease in the second quarter.  Operating profits increased in 14 of 22 industries.
Manufacturing industries led the overall increase, accounting
for nearly 30% of the $2.6 billion rise in operating profits
over the second quarter.  In the non-financial sector, third-quarter operating
profits rose 3.7% to $52.9 billion, following a 5.7% decrease in
the previous quarter. The majority of the third-quarter increase
came from the manufacturing industries, while most other non-
financial industries experienced little change.  In the financial sector, operating profits increased 3.7%
to $19.2 billion, following a 10.5% decline in the second
quarter. Most third-quarter gains came from depository credit
intermediaries.  On a year-over-year basis, operating profits for Canadian
corporations were 3.1% higher in the third quarter. Profits fell
2.5% in the non-financial sector, while they rose 22.7% in the
financial sector.  Non-financial sector  Operating profits in manufacturing increased 6.3% to $12.4
billion in the third quarter.  Increases were reported by 4 of 13 manufacturing industries,
led by petroleum and coal products manufacturers. Their
operating profits increased 54.2% to $4.3 billion as production
rebounded following partial shutdowns at several plants for
retooling and maintenance work.  Without this growth in operating profits in the petroleum
and coal manufacturing industry, manufacturing profits would
have fallen by nearly $800 million.  Profits for chemical, plastics and rubber products
manufacturers fell 11.7% to $1.8 billion.  Operating profits of motor vehicles and parts manufacturers
declined 18.9% to $768 million.  Primary metal manufacturing profits fell 19.4% to $624
million.  Profits for information and cultural industries rose 7.6%
to $5.5 billion. Most of the increase came from the
telecommunications industry, where profits rose 8.1% to $4.0
billion.  Profits in transportation and warehousing rose 14.6% to
$2.9 billion.  Oil and gas extraction and support activities profits fell
1.3% to $2.2 billion.  Retailers’ profits increased 1.8% to $4.1 billion, while
wholesalers’ profits rose 3.4% to $5.8 billion.  Financial sector  The third-quarter increase of 3.7% in the financial sector
was driven by depository credit intermediaries, whose operating
profits rose 7.2% to $10.7 billion. At the same time, profits
for insurance carriers declined 11.7% to $1.3 billion.  Note to readers  Quarterly financial statistics are compiled using financial
information provided by enterprises that derive this data from
their financial statements. Starting on January 1, 2011,
Canadian publicly accountable enterprises are required to
replace Canadian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles
(CGAAP) with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
when preparing their financial statements for fiscal years
starting on or after January 1, 2011. Canadian private
enterprises are required to replace CGAAP by Accounting
Standards for Private Enterprises or IFRS. The adoption of new
accounting standards by some enterprises since the beginning of
2011 may affect comparability with prior periods.  Quarterly profit numbers referred to in this release are
seasonally adjusted and are in current dollars. The quarterly
financial data for the first and second quarters of 2012 have
been revised. For more information on seasonal adjustment, see

upon a sample survey and represent the activities of all
corporations in  Canada , except those that are government
controlled or not-for-profit. An enterprise can be a single
corporation or a family of corporations under common ownership
and/or control, for which consolidated financial statements are
produced.  Profits referred to in this analysis are operating profits
earned from normal business activities. For non-financial
industries, operating profits exclude interest and dividend
revenue and capital gains/losses whereas, for financial
industries, these are included, along with interest paid on
deposits.  Operating profits differ from net profits, which represent
the after-tax profits earned by corporations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
