Tunisiaâ€™s state grains office is
seeking to buy two cargoes of feed barley, each amounting to
25,000 metric tons, according to two traders with direct
knowledge of the tender.  The office wants the shipments for delivery in January,
said the traders, who declined to be identified because they are
unauthorized to speak to the media. The deadline for bids is
tomorrow, they said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
