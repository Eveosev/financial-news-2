European Union pig prices declined
this week, with German hogs falling for the first time in four
weeks, industry group Interessengemeinschaft der Schweinehalter
Deutschlands e.V. reported.  German prices fell to 1.726 euros ($2.24) a kilogram (2.2
pounds) from 1.776 euros the previous week, Damme, Germany-based
ISN wrote in a  report  on its website today. Prices in  France 
resumed their slide, while those in  Spain  fell for a sixth week,
the group said.  Germany, Spain and France are the EU’s biggest pork
producers, statistics from the bloc show. The drop in Spanish
prices means the gap with cheaper German pork fell to less than
5 cents from more than 12 cents five weeks ago.  “The pressure on pig prices continues across Europe,” ISN
wrote. “On the Spanish side, the above-average offer and
flagging demand are cited as reasons. In particular exports to
 Russia  aren’t flowing like they were a few weeks ago.”  Spanish prices fell to 1.774 euros a kilogram from 1.793
euros last week, down 17.5 cents in the past six weeks. French
prices declined to 1.703 euros a kilogram after having climbed
to 1.739 euros a week ago.  The cost of hogs also fell in the Netherlands and  Belgium ,
and rose in  Denmark  to 1.799 euros a kilogram from 1.758 euros.  “Totally contrary to the trend, the prices in Denmark rose
4 cents in this slaughter week,” ISN wrote. “Unlike in the
other EU countries the supply of slaughter-ready animals there
doesn’t fully cover current demand.”  The EU has forecast output of pig meat in the bloc will
decline 3.2 percent next year on higher feed costs and new
animal welfare rules.  To contact the reporter on this story:
