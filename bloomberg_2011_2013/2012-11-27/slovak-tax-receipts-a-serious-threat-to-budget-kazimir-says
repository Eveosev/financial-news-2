Slovakia’s  budget  goals face a
“serious threat” from waning tax receipts, forcing the
government to rewrite next year’s spending plan, Finance
Minister Peter Kazimir said.  The slowing economy will cut tax receipts this year by 276
million euros ($357 million) and about 250 million euros in
2013, Kazimir told a news conference today in the capital,
Bratislava. The government will trim spending to remain “as
close as possible” to the original 2012 deficit target of 4.6
percent of gross domestic product, he said.  The east euro-region country is striving to improve its
public finances at a time when the slowdown in western  Europe  is
hurting demand for Slovak exports. To distance itself from the
euro-area’s debt crisis, the administration has kept to a pledge
to reduce the  budget deficit  below the European Union’s limit of
3 percent of GDP in 2013, Kazimir said.  “We are not giving it up, there is still a chance for
meeting” the 2012 budget goal, Kazimir said. “We still hope to
prepare a 2013 budget with a deficit below the EU’s limit
without the need for more measures. We have a buffer.”  The government will withdraw the budget from parliament and
resubmit it next month, Kazimir said. The spending plan targeted
a shortfall equal to 2.94 percent of GDP.  The  economy  is set to grow 2.6 percent in 2012, the fastest
pace in the euro area, which may shrink 0.4 percent this year,
according to European Commission forecasts. Growth in 2013 is
projected to be the second-fastest after  Estonia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
