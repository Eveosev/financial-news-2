Teenagers are 26 times more likely
to send  text messages  while driving than their parents expect,
based on preliminary results of a safety study by  Toyota Motor
Corp. (7203)  and the  University of Michigan .  The survey of more than 5,500 people in the U.S.,
consisting of drivers aged 16 to 18 and their parents, also
found 69 percent of teens regularly drive with other teenagers
and no adults, Toyota said in a  statement  yesterday.  “Teens read or send text messages once a trip 26 times
more often than their parents think they do,” Toyota said in
the statement. Some 54 percent of teens surveyed in the study
also said they use a hand-held mobile phone while driving.  The study is part of efforts by Toyota to boost vehicle
safety after record recalls of Toyota vehicles in 2009 and 2010
for gasoline-pedal defects. The Toyota City, Japan-based company
said in January 2011 it would spend $50 million over five years
on a Collaborative Safety Research Center at its technical
center in  Ann Arbor , Michigan, to find ways to reduce auto
fatalities. Ann Arbor also is the site of the University of
Michigan’s main campus.  Automotive crashes are the leading cause of death for U.S.
teens, with seven drivers between ages 16 and 19 dying daily in
2010 as a result of accidents, Toyota said, citing the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Toyota, Asia’s largest automaker, fell 1.3 percent to 3,530
yen in Tokyo trading yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
