February 2023 to February 2031. The purchases are part of the
Fed’s program to replace short-term debt in its portfolio with
longer-term Treasuries in an effort to keep borrowing costs low.  The central bank plans to purchase from $1.5 billion to $2
billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
