Pitcher  Andy Pettitte  is close to
signing a one-year contract worth about $11 million to return to
the  New York Yankees , CBSSports.com reported.  Pettitte, 40, decided in the last couple of days that he
would rejoin the Yankees for his 18th Major League Baseball
season, while the team is optimistic it will have a deal with
42-year-old relief pitcher Mariano Rivera by the end of the
week, the  website said  without citing a source.  Pettitte, who retired for the 2011 season, returned this
year and went 5-4 with a 2.87 earned run average, pitching his
first game on May 13 and missing more than two months of the
campaign after being hit on the ankle by a ball in late June.  Other than a 2004-06 stint with the  Houston Astros ,
Pettitte has played his entire career in New York, posting a
245-142 record with a 3.86 ERA. His win total is 51st all-time
and second among active pitchers behind 50-year-old  Jamie Moyer ,
with 269.  Rivera, whose 608 saves are the most in major-league
history, missed most of last season after tearing a knee
ligament while catching fly balls during a May practice. He
hinted during 2011 spring training that the season might be his
last, though after the injury he vowed to return.  To contact the reporter on this story:
