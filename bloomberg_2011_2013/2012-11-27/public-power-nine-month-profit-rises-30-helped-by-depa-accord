Public Power Corp. SA (PPC) , Greece’s
biggest electricity supplier, posted a 30 percent nine-month
profit increase, as settlement of a financial dispute with Depa
SA and lower staff costs helped to offset higher fuel expenses.  Net income rose to 118.1 million euros ($153.3 million)
from 90.8 million euros in the year-earlier period, the company,
known as PPC, said in an Athens-bourse  filing  today.  The cost of liquid fuel, natural gas and energy purchases
rose to 2.45 billion euros, or 54.4 percent of total revenue,
from 1.7 billion a year earlier. Sales increased 8.7 percent to
4.56 billion euros.  The results “were positively impacted by 191.7 million
euros from the resolution of financial issues with Depa that
have been outstanding for more than four years,” Chief
Executive Officer Arthouros Zervos said in the statement. Depa
is  Greece ’s largest natural gas supplier.  Paris Mantzavras, an analyst at Athens-based Pantelakis
Securities, said in a note today that, excluding the “much
higher than forecast one-off gains from the Depa settlement,
third-quarter results came in worse than our estimates, with the
miss mostly attributed to higher costs for energy purchases.”  PPC’s total payroll costs fell by 155.2 million euros, or
16.3 percent, as the number of permanent employees fell to
20,367 from 21,075. As a percentage of revenue, payroll expenses
declined to 15.5 percent, from 19.9 percent.  Zervos said the company forecast is that 2012 earnings
before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization will be 17.5
percent to 18 percent of revenue, based on sales of 6 billion
euros and taking into account effects of prolonged recession and
lack of cash.  Provisions for unpaid bills in the nine months rose by 134
million euros to 229.5 million, including 57.4 million for high
voltage customer Larco SA,  Europe ’s biggest ferronickel
producer. PPC’s net debt was 4.7 billion euros, unchanged from
the end of 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
