Halliburton Co. (HAL) , the Houston-based
oilfield-services provider, said it continues to pay workers in
western  Venezuela  after El Universal reported a strike over pay.  The Caracas-based newspaper reported Nov. 24 that
Halliburton was among companies to have told workers they can’t
be paid while the companies haven’t been paid by state-owned
Petroleos de Venezuela SA.  “Halliburton has not made such communications,” the
company wrote in an e-mailed response to the article.
“Halliburton continues to honor and fulfill our pay obligations
to our employees.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
