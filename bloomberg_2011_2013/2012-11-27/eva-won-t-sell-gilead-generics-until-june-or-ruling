Teva Pharmaceuticals agreed to delay
the introduction of generic versions of two  Gilead Sciences Inc. (GILD) 
HIV drugs until June if a judge hasn’t ruled in its favor by
then in a patent case brought by Gilead.  U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan in Manhattan is set to
begin a non-jury trial of Gilead’s patent-infringement lawsuit
Feb. 20. If he doesn’t rule by June 1, Teva may begin to sell
the drugs Truvada and Viread, according to an agreement between
the two companies that was filed today in federal court.  Gilead, based in Foster City,  California , sued Teva in 2008
and again in 2010, claiming that Teva’s applications to the  U.S.
Food and Drug Administration  to make drugs to treat HIV
infections in adults infringed four of its patents. The
complaints also listed the HIV drug Atripla, which wasn’t cited
in today’s filing.  Teva, based in Petach Tikva, Israel, said in court papers
that Gilead’s patents were invalid and couldn’t be infringed.  The case is Gilead Sciences v.  Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA)  USA,
10-01796, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
