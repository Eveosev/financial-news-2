WikiLeaks lost more than $50 million
in potential donations after Visa  Europe ,  MasterCard Inc. (MA)  and
 American Express Co. (AXP)  blocked payments to the anti-secrecy group,
according to its founder Julian Assange.  Assange said WikiLeaks and its payment-services provider
DataCell want European Union antitrust regulators to reconsider
a preliminary decision not to probe claims that the blockade by
the card networks violated competition rules.  WikiLeaks  drew condemnation from the U.S government for
posting thousands of classified documents on its website,
including U.S. embassy communications and a military video of a
July 2007 helicopter attack in  Iraq  that killed a Reuters
television cameraman and his driver.  “The economic blockade, to me, extends out of the reaction
to our publications in 2010 and 2011 from the U.S. military,”
Assange told reporters in Brussels via video call from the
Ecuadorean Embassy in  London , where he sought asylum in June to
avoid extradition to  Sweden  on allegations of rape and sexual
molestation. “We have lost at least $50 million.”  DataCell’s complaint from last year “doesn’t merit further
investigation because it is unlikely that any infringement of EU
competition rules could be established,” Antoine Colombani, a
spokesman for the Brussels-based European Commission, said by e-
mail.  All Rejections  DataCell hasn’t been blocked from accepting card payments
for its own services or for others except WikiLeaks, Colombani
said, adding the EU will make a final decision after considering
DataCell’s response.  Andreas Fink, chief executive officer of DataCell, said in
an e-mail that every credit-card processor the company contacted
“rejected us due to our processing for WikiLeaks.”  Philipp Bruchert, a spokesman for MasterCard in Brussels,
and Mark Hooper, a spokesman for  Visa Europe  in London, declined
to comment. A representatives for American Express declined to
immediately comment.  Ecuador granted Assange diplomatic asylum saying he is the
victim of political persecution. The move set off a diplomatic
spat with Britain which refuses to grant him safe passage out of
the country.  To contact the reporters on this story:
