HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) ’s updated
compliance procedures would weed out products such as wrongly-
sold loan insurance because they would be identified as too
profitable, said Antonio Simoes, head of the bank’s U.K. unit.  A reputational risk committee scrutinizes very profitable
trades and products, Simoes told a panel of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards today.  Payment protection insurance “would have been picked up
currently through our product approval procedures,” Simoes
said. “One of the key issues we looked at was the profitability
of the product and a product which is disproportionately
profitable in our current processes would not have been
approved.”  HSBC has set aside $2.1 billion after regulators ordered
banks to compensate clients who were forced to buy, or didn’t
know they had bought insurance to cover their repayments on
mortgages, credit cards and other loans. British banks have made
provisions of about 11 billion pounds ($17.6 billion) to redress
consumers.  “PPI is an industry issue in which the industry has failed
consumers and I believe we would not currently approve a product
such as PPI,” Simoes said.  -- Editors: Jon Menon,  Keith Campbell   To contact the reporter on this story:
