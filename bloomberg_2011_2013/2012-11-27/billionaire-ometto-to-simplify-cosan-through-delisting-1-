Brazilian billionaire Rubens Ometto
will delist either Cosan SA Industria & Comercio or its parent
 Cosan Ltd. (CZZ)  to “simplify” the capital structure of the world’s
largest sugarcane processor.  “The plan is to have a single company listed,” Ometto,
62, told reporters in  Sao Paulo  yesterday. “We are exhaustively
studying the better way to do that.”  The parent company based in Hamilton,  Bermuda , was created
in 2007, allowing Ometto to boost Cosan’s capital without
diluting it. Ometto transferred his controlling stake in Cosan
to the new holding company and created a class of shares with 10
times more voting power than the existing class. In the same
year, Cosan Ltd. raised $1.1 billion in an initial public
offering in the U.S. to fund a unit expansion.  “I want to simplify the  capital structure ,” he said.
“The decision has been made. Now it’s a matter of how.” He
plans to announce a detailed plan next year.  Cosan Ltd. trades in  New York , Cosan SA in Sao Paulo.
Ometto indirectly holds 39.3 percent in Cosan Ltd., which
controls Cosan SA with a 59.3 percent stake.  Cosan rose 0.5 percent at 1:35 p.m. in Sao Paulo. The stock
has gained 48 percent this year, while its parent has climbed 52
percent in New York. The Bovespa stock index has advanced 0.4
percent in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
