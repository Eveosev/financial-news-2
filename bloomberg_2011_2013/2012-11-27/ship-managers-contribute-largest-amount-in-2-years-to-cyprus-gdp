Cyprus’s ship-management companies
contributed more to the island’s gross domestic product in the
first half of 2012 than they had for two years, the  Central Bank
of Cyprus  said.  Revenue from ship-management, which includes finding rental
contracts and crews for vessels, rose by 2 percent to 435
million euros ($563 million), or 5 percent of GDP, from 428
million euros at the end of 2011, the central bank said in a
 statement  today on its website.  Cyprus, the European Union’s biggest ship-management
center, became in June the fourth euro-area nation to request a
financial rescue since  Greece ’s 2010 bailout. The rescue will
encompass banks weakened by exposure to the Greek economy as
well as the public sector. The Cypriot economy will shrink 2.4
percent this year and 3.5 percent in 2013, according to the 2013
budget, released on Nov. 22.  German shipowners accounted for 55 percent of ship
managers’ revenue, down from 60 percent at the end of 2011;
Swiss-owned shipping companies contributed 11 percent, up from 8
percent, and Vietnamese owners 6 percent, unchanged from the end
of last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
