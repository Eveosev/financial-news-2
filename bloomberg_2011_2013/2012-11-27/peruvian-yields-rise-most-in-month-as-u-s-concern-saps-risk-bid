Peru ’s dollar bonds fell, pushing
yields up the most in a month, on concern the struggle of U.S.
lawmakers to reach a budget compromise may derail the world’s
largest economy and erode demand for risk.  The yield on the benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-denominated
bond due in March 2037 rose seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3.72 percent at 10:39 a.m. in Lima, the
biggest increase on a closing basis since Oct. 26, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price dropped 1.5 cents to 145
cents per dollar.  The U.S., Peru’s biggest trading partner after China, faces
a so-called fiscal cliff of $607 billion in automatic spending
cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect starting Jan. 1
if Congress can’t agree to reduce the deficit.  “The deadline is approaching, and there’s still no deal,”
said  Siobhan Morden , the head of Latin America fixed- income
strategy at Jefferies Group Inc. in New York. “We’re heading
for a period of more  risk aversion .”  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.5875 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
