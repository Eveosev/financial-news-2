Argentine bonds rose the most in a
week after the government said it is willing to consider paying
holders of defaulted debt under the same terms it gave investors
that accepted the 2010 restructuring.  The extra yield investors demand to own Argentine
government dollar bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell 67 basis
points, or 0.67 percentage point, to 1,281 basis points at 11:25
a.m.  New York  time. The spread is dropping the most in  emerging
markets , according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Argentina said that a scenario in which holdouts seek equal
terms with investors who accepted swaps in restructurings may be
debated in Congress, according to a statement e-mailed by the
Economy Ministry yesterday. Judge Thomas Griesa’s ruling that
holdouts have the right to receive all the principal and
interest they are owed is unfair, according to the statement.  The statement from Argentina may prompt the appeals court
to block orders by Griesa, according to Aberdeen Asset
Management Plc’s  Edwin Gutierrez , who helps manage $9 billion of
emerging-market debt, including Argentine bonds.  What is driving bond prices is “this mention by the
Argentines of a potential reopening of the exchange,” he said.
“The appeals court might look upon the offer favorably and
reinstate the stay while they consider the matter.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
