Gedeon  Richter Nyrt ., Hungary’s
biggest drugmaker, fell to the lowest in almost six months
before the stock is dropped from MSCI Inc.’s Hungarian index at
the end of this month.  The shares slumped 2.9 percent to 35,560 forint, the lowest
close since May 30 and bringing its decline in the past four
trading sessions to 6.1 percent. The benchmark BUX stock index
in which Richter has a 19 percent weighting fell 1 percent
today.  Richter was the only Hungarian stock to be removed from the
MSCI Hungary Index as part of a semi-annual review of the
gauge’s members, effective Nov. 30, according to a statement on
MSCI’s website on Nov. 14. The shares have retreated 12 percent
since the announcement.  “There may be renewed selling pressure on the stock in the
coming days,” Gergely Tardos, a Budapest-based analyst at OTP
Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s largest lender, wrote in an e-mailed
report today, citing the exit from the MSCI basket.  To contact the reporter on this story:
