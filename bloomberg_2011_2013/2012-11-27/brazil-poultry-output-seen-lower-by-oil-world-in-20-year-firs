Brazil ’s poultry output is expected
to decline for the first time in 20 years as chicken farmers
curb production in response to rising feed costs, oilseed
industry researcher Oil World said.  Poultry meat output may fall 4.1 percent to 12.3 million
metric tons this year from 12.9 million tons in 2011, Hamburg-
based Oil World wrote in a report today. Brazil’s exports of
poultry, the world’s biggest, may slip to 3.91 million tons from
3.95 million tons.  Brazil’s poultry production almost doubled in the past
decade and now ranks behind the U.S. and  China , while the
country’s exports more than tripled. Brazil produced 37.8
million tons of poultry feed last year, of which 25 percent was
soy meal and 61 percent corn, Oil World said.  “Producers have cut back in response to high feed prices
and unattractive margins,” Oil World said. “This is the first
year-on-year reduction in 20 years. A slight reduction occurred
in exports, but most of the decline is going to occur in the
domestic market, reducing average consumption per person.”  Brazil’s poultry consumption is predicted to slip to 8.42
million tons from 8.92 million tons last year, with per-capita
consumption falling to 43.41 kilograms (95.7 pounds) from 46.34
kilograms, Oil World said.  Most of Brazil’s poultry meat is produced in the southern
states, where the corn harvest at the start of the year was
“sharply” reduced by drought, according to Oil World.  “Domestic poultry prices increased and were up by about 25
percent from a year earlier in October and early November, but
the increase in feed costs was considerably higher,” the
researcher wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
