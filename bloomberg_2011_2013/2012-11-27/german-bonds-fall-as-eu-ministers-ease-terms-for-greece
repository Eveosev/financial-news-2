Germany ’s bonds fell, pushing 10-
year yields to the highest level in three weeks, after European
finance ministers eased the terms on emergency aid for  Greece ,
damping demand for the region’s safest assets.  Ten-year bund  yields  climbed the most in a week after the
ministers cleared Greece to receive a 34.4 billion-euro ($44.5
billion) loan installment in December and engineered a bond
buyback. Greek bonds gained as some investors speculated the
buyback will take place at higher prices to entice sellers.
 Spain ’s securities advanced after the nation sold 4.09 billion
euros of bills and the Greek deal buoyed sentiment toward
borrowers in  Europe ’s peripheral countries.  “With Greece, there has been severe tightening of
spreads,” said Christian Reicherter, an analyst at DZ Bank AG
in  Frankfurt . “The mood is quite positive with regard to the
latest outcome” while the Spanish debt sale was “quite
supportive,” he said.  The German 10-year yield rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 1.44 percent at 5 p.m. London time after
reaching 1.47 percent, the highest since Nov. 2. The 1.5 percent
bond due in September 2022 dropped 0.235, or 2.35 euros per
1,000-euro face amount, to 100.545.  The two-year rate climbed two basis points to 0.02 percent.  Euro-area finance ministers meeting in Brussels agreed to
lower the rates on bailout loans for Greece, suspended the
nation’s interest payments for a decade and gave the country
more time to repay.  ‘Peripherals Stabilize’  “The fate of Greece is no longer a day-in, day-out
worry,”  Ciaran O’Hagan , head of European rates strategy at
Societe Generale SA in Paris, wrote today in a note to clients.
“That ought to prove a big relief in time and help other
peripherals stabilize.”  The finance ministers said in a statement “any tender or
exchange prices” as part of a buyback of Greek securities “are
expected to be no higher than those at the close” on Nov. 23.  The price of Greece’s 2 percent bonds maturing in February
2023 climbed 0.645 to 34.94 percent of face value. They were at
34.36 percent on Nov. 23. The yield dropped 26 basis points
today to 16.25 percent.  The yield on the nation’s  30-year bond  declined 66 basis
points to 12.98 percent after falling to 12.95 percent, the
lowest since the country’s debt was restructured in March.  “The debt buyback is a very grey area,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , a fixed-income strategist at RIA Capital Markets
Ltd. in Edinburgh. “Maybe investors are bidding them higher to
try and encourage them to push higher the price of the buyback.
People are anticipating what price they are going to get and are
trying to make the best of it.”  Spanish Auction  Spain’s two-year notes advanced for a sixth day as the
country sold three-month bills at an average yield of 1.254
percent, down from 1.415 percent at the previous auction on Oct.
23. It allotted six-month securities at 1.669 percent, versus
2.023 percent last month.  The Spanish two-year yield dropped eight basis points to
2.92 percent after falling to 2.91 percent, the  lowest level 
since Oct. 23. The 10-year yield declined 10 basis points to
5.52 percent.  Italy  sold 3.5 billion euros of zero-coupon notes due in
2014 at an average yield of 1.923 percent, the lowest rate since
an auction of similar securities in October 2010. Italy also
allotted inflation-linked bonds due in 2019 and 2026.  Italy’s two-year note yield dropped two basis points to
1.97 percent.  French Bonds  French bonds advanced for a third day as a report showed a
gauge of  consumer confidence  was unchanged in November, halting
four months of declines. French household sentiment held at 84
this month, the national statistics office Insee said in Paris.  The yield on  France ’s 10-year bonds dropped two basis
points to 2.12 percent.  “We do see further normalization at the moment, and core
yields are going to grind higher,” said Rasmus Rousing, a
fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“On the data front, it’s still a mixed picture.”  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-
region markets, followed by those of Austria and  Belgium ,
according to measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt,
the spread between two- and 10-year securities, and credit
default swaps.  The Netherlands sold 2.4 billion euros of 2015 notes at a
 record-low  average-auction yield of 0.129 percent.  German bonds returned 3.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
debt also gained 3.6 percent and Italy’s rose 19 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
