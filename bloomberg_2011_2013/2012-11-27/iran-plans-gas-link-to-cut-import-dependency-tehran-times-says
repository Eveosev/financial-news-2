Iran  plans to build a pipeline to
increase natural gas supplies to its northern provinces and cut
reliance on imports from  Turkmenistan , the Tehran Times
reported, citing a top energy official.  The 160-kilometer (99-mile) link, which will carry gas from
Semnan province to Mazandaran province, bordering the  Caspian
Sea , will be completed in two years at a cost of 3.5 trillion
rials ($286 million), the report cited Javad Owji, National
Iranian Gas Co.â€™s managing director, as saying.  Iran imports as much as 18 million cubic meters of gas a
day from Turkmenistan and the figure rises as high as 30 million
cubic meters in winter months, according to the report.  The country consumed 153.3 billion cubic meters of gas last
year and produced 151.8 billion cubic meters, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
