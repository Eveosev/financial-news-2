OAO MegaFon (MFON) , Russia’s second-largest
mobile operator by users, received more than enough orders to
fill its initial public offering on the last day of the sale,
according to two people with knowledge of the matter.  The order book is covered at $20 a share, allowing the IPO
to raise at least $1.7 billion, the people said, asking not to
be identified as the details aren’t public yet. The company
declined to comment. Megafon, based in Moscow, had initially set
a price range of $20 to $25 for the shares. Trading of shares
will begin Nov. 28 in London and Moscow.  Megafon, which competes with Russia’s largest mobile
operator  OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) , or MTS, had postponed an IPO
marketing campaign in October, raising investor speculation the
demand may have trailed expectations amid the sovereign debt
crisis. Megafon still attracted enough investors as it offers an
alternative in the Russian telecommunications industry, said
Moscow-based  UralSib Capital  analyst Konstantin Chernyshev.  “MegaFon’s placement will offer alternative exposure to
the Russian telecoms sector, with reasonable top-line growth,
stable cashflows, and attractive dividends,” he said.  MegaFon agreed to pay 50 percent of profit or 70 percent of
free cash flows in dividends. MTS is paying half of profit in
dividends and plans to increase the payout.  ‘Tiny Discount’  A price of $20 per MegaFon share ‘‘is adequate,
approximately equal to MTS, reflecting just a tiny discount,’’
said Igor Semenov, a Moscow-based analyst at Deutsche Bank.  At $20 per share, MegaFon would be valued at a enterprise
value of 4.2 times estimated 2013 earnings before interest
taxes, depreciation and amortization compared with 4.3 times for
MTS, according to Semenov.  Megafon’s sale comes on the heels of another telecom
operator, Telefonica Deutschland Holding AG, raising 1.5 billion
euros ($1.95 billion) in Europe’s largest IPO this year.  IPOs have raised less than a third of the amount in 2011 as
equities fell out of favor amid the sovereign debt crisis in
Europe, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Equity sales from
Russia increased as  OAO Sberbank (SBER) , the country’s largest lender
sold $5.2 billion of share in a secondary offering in September.  Shareholder Deal  The sale is a part of a shareholder agreement reached in
April with  Alisher Usmanov , the Russian billionaire who controls
MegaFon, to resolve disputes between Stockholm-based  TeliaSonera
AB (TLSN)  and the venture’s local owners. Usmanov will retain his 50
percent holding, while TeliaSonera will keep at least 25
percent, MegaFon said this month.  The IPO, which may be the largest in Russia since that of
 United Co. Rusal’s (486)  in 2010, will have a 10 percent so-called
over-allotment option to cover extra demand, Megafon said on
Nov. 15. MegaFon and TeliaSonera  are selling a combined 15
percent stake through the transaction.  TeliaSonera today said its CEO Lars Nyberg would buy shares
worth $2 million in the IPO, at their offer price. Nyberg is a
member of Megafon’s board of directors.  Morgan Stanley (MS)  and OAO Sberbank are managing MegaFon’s
share sale, with help from  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ,  Citigroup
Inc. (C)  and  VTB Capital. (VTBR)   To contact the reporters on this story:
