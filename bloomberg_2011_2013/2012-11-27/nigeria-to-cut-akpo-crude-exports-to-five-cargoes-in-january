Nigeria , Africaâ€™s largest oil
producer, plans to reduce Akpo crude exports for January to five
cargoes of 1 million barrels each, one less than December,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The country will also ship two consignments of Abo, two of
Okono, two of Yoho and one of Pennington, according to separate
plans. Cargo sizes range from 450,000 barrels to 950,000
barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
