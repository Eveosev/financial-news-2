Soybeans reached a two-week high in
Chicago on concern that planting delays in South America may
curb production. Wheat advanced on the worst U.S. winter-crop
conditions in at least 27 years.  In  Brazil , 74 percent of the soybean crop was planted,
against 81 percent a year earlier, researcher Celeres said
yesterday.  Argentina  has sown 37 percent of its soybeans, from
47 percent in 2011, the Buenos Aires Cereals Exchange said Nov.
22. Soybeans surged to a record in September after the worst
U.S. drought in half a century parched fields. Brazil, the U.S.
and Argentina are forecast to be the three largest growers this
year by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  “The world is watching the South American corn and soybean
crops at the moment,” Michael Creed, an agribusiness economist
at National Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from Melbourne.
“We need a big South American crop to allay concerns about
tightness across the grains and oilseeds complex.”  Soybeans for delivery in January rose 0.7 percent to
$14.3525 a bushel at 6:55 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.
The oilseed touched $14.405, the highest level for a most-active
contract since Nov. 12. Prices are still down 20 percent from
the record $17.89 reached Sept. 4.  Most soybean-growing areas in Brazil will have rain this
week, helping ease dry conditions, weather consultant Somar
Meteorologia said yesterday. In Argentina, where fields were too
wet, another round of storms starting tomorrow night may bring
1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) of rain, further delaying planting,
Telvent DTN said today.  U.S. Drought  Wheat for delivery in March rose 0.9 percent to $8.7175 a
bushel. The grain touched $8.725, the highest price since Nov.
14. In Paris, milling wheat for delivery in January climbed 0.8
percent to 272 euros ($353) a metric ton on NYSE Liffe.  In the U.S., winter-wheat conditions were the worst for
records dating to 1985, the USDA said yesterday. An estimated 33
percent of the crop was  rated  good or excellent as of Nov. 25,
down from 34 percent last week and 52 percent in 2011.  Ninety-four percent of the U.S. high  plains , including all
of  Kansas , the country’s top winter-wheat grower, experienced
drought ranging from “moderate” to “exceptional” as of Nov.
20, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, a gauge organized by
government and university groups. The region is unlikely to have
any rain through Dec. 11, QT Weather said yesterday in a report.  Corn for delivery in March advanced 0.5 percent to $7.55 a
bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
