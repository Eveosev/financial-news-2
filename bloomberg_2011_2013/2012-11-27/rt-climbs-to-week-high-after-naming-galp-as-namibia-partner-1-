HRT Participacoes em Petroleo SA (HRTP3) 
rallied to the highest in a week after it assigned a stake in a
Namibian offshore oil exploration site to a Portuguese partner.  Shares gained 2.5 percent to 5.33 reais at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, the highest since Nov. 19. The  Bovespa
index (IBOV)  fell 0.9 percent, as oil producers OGX Petroleo e Gas
Participacoes SA and  Petroleo Brasileiro SA tumbled .  Rio de Janeiro-based HRT said in a regulatory filing
yesterday after the close of trading that it assigned 14 percent
of its exploratory rights to blocks off the coast of Namibia to
 Galp Energia SGPS SA. (GALP)   “There’s no information on values, but it’s important to
breathe life to the capital structure and funding of the
drillings,” Roberto Altenhofen, an analyst at the equity
consulting firm Empiricus Research in Sao Paulo, said by e-mail.
“And it’s an important signal of value for the region.” He has
a buy rating on HRT.  HRT has tumbled 53 percent this year, while the Bovespa
lost 0.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
