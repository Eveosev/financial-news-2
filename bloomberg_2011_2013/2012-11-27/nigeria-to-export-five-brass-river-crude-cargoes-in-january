Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil
producer, plans to export five Brass River crude cargoes in
January, including four deferred from December, according to a
loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  The January program comprises two shipments of 950,000
barrels, two of 450,000 barrels and one of 620,000 barrels, the
plan showed. Exports for December were revised down to one lot
of 950,000 barrels, a separate plan showed.  Eni SpA (ENI)  declared force majeure, a legal step that protects
a company from liability when it can’t fulfill a contract for
reasons beyond its control, on Brass River exports, the company
said in an e-mailed statement on Nov. 8.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
