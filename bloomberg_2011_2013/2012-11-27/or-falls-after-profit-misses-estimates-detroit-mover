Thor Industries Inc. (THO)  fell the most
in almost seven months after the maker of Airstream recreational
vehicles and Champion buses reported a fiscal first-quarter
profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates.  The  shares  slid 10 percent to $39.18 at 10:50 a.m.  New York 
time after plunging 12 percent, the biggest intraday decline
since May 3. The company had gained 59 percent this year through
yesterday, while the Standard & Poor’s Midcap Consumer
Discretionary Index rose 22 percent.  Thor, based in Jackson Center, Ohio, reported quarterly net
income of $31 million, or 58 cents a share, in a statement after
the markets closed yesterday. The average of six analysts’
 projections  compiled by Bloomberg was 62 cents a share for the
period ended Oct. 31.  Sales of recreational vehicles are monitored as a sign of
an improving economy because motor homes and travel trailers are
discretionary purchases that consumers defer during a slump.  “The RV and bus markets remain very competitive, with
heightened discounting and aggressive bidding affecting sales
and margins,” Chief Operating Officer  Bob Martin  said in
yesterday’s statement.  The company said in preliminary quarterly results on Nov. 5
that quarterly sales increased 30 percent, which spurred the
shares to gain 10 percent the following day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
