Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  said it’s
conducting an “intense” internal investigation and has
uncovered extensive evidence of improper accounting at Autonomy
Corp., a software company it bought last year.  Responding to a letter by former Autonomy Chief Executive
Officer Mike Lynch calling on Hewlett-Packard’s board to explain
its allegations, Hewlett-Packard said that the matter was now in
the “hands of authorities.”  “While Dr. Lynch is eager for a debate, we believe the
legal process is the correct method in which to bring out the
facts and take action on behalf of our shareholders,” Hewlett-
Packard said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
