Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. (FOGL) , the
explorer focused on the namesake South Atlantic islands, said
its Scotia well found a poor quality reservoir that won’t yield
oil or gas.  The well was drilled to 5,555 meters (18,225 feet), the
company said in a statement today in  London . While the well
encountered some gas and hydrocarbon-bearing stones, the oil or
gas wouldn’t flow to the surface. The well will now be plugged
and abandoned, the company said.  Falkland Oil and its partners  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  and Edison
SpA targeted about 1 billion barrels of oil at Scotia. The
company made the second gas discovery this year at its Loligo
project after  Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR)  said in July that
it found gas, including some liquids, south of the islands
 Margaret Thatcher  went to war to keep British in 1982.  “During 2012 we have drilled two encouraging wells, both
of which found hydrocarbons and were completed safely and within
budget,” Falkland Oil Chief Executive Officer Tim Bushell said
in the statement. “They reinforce our confidence in the
potential of the basin.”  Falkland Oil will start a new program of seismic work
which, combined with the results from Scotia, may help identify
a better quality reservoir in the block.  The London-based company will have about $220 million in
cash after its 2012 drilling campaign, it said.  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH)  made the first commercial
discovery off the Falklands with Sea Lion, which  Premier Oil Plc (PMO) 
agreed to help develop with a $1 billion investment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
