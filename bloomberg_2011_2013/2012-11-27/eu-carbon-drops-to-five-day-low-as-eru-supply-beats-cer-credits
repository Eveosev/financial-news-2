European Union carbon permits
dropped to the lowest in five days as the pace of Certified
Emission Reduction supply since September was exceeded by
Emission Reduction Units.  EU permits for December declined 1.5 percent to 6.74 euros
($8.73) a metric ton on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London  at 10:14 a.m., the lowest since Nov. 22. Factories and
power stations in the EU program can use a limited portion of
United Nations offset credits as a cheaper form of compliance.
Certified Emission Reduction credits for December rose 1 cent to
75 cents a ton.  Supplies of ERUs surged by 175 million, or 68 percent, to
432 million tons in the period to Nov. 16 from Sept. 19,
according to data e-mailed yesterday by the United Nations
Framework Convention on Climate Change. Thatâ€™s almost triple the
63 million tons of CERs issued in the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
