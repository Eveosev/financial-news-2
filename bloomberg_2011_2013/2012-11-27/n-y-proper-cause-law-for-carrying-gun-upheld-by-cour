A  New York  law requiring “proper
cause” for getting a license to carry a handgun in public
doesn’t violate the constitutional right to bear arms, a federal
appeals court  ruled .  A three-judge panel in  Manhattan  today upheld a lower
court’s dismissal of a lawsuit filed by five people who were
denied full-carry concealed handgun permits in New York. They
sued along with the Second Amendment Foundation, a Bellevue,
Washington, group that supports gun rights. A federal court in
 White Plains , New York, threw out the case in September 2011.  In its opinion, the appeals court said that the state has
“a fair degree of latitude” to regulate the possession and use
of guns in public without violating the Constitution.  “We decline plaintiffs’ invitation to strike down New
York’s one-hundred-year-old law and call into question the
state’s traditional authority to extensively regulate handgun
possession in public,” U.S. Circuit Judge Richard Wesley wrote
in the opinion.  The case is Kachalsky v. County of Westchester, 11-3642,
 U.S. Court of Appeals  for the Second Circuit (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
