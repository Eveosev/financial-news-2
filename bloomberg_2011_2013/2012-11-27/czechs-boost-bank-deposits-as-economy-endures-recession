Czech households and businesses
increased deposits in banks at the end of September even as the
economy suffered a yearlong recession.  Client deposits rose by 239 billion koruna ($12 billion),
or 8.3 percent, to total 3.1 trillion koruna from the same
period of the previous year, the Prague-based Czech Banking
Association said in a statement today. Household deposits rose 3
percent to 1.8 trillion koruna, it said.  “Deposit growth is significantly exceeding the annual
increase in loans, allowing domestic banks to maintain very
favorable ratio of loans to deposits and therefore a comfortable
systemic liquidity position,” the association said. The loan-
to-deposit ratio was 76 percent, it said.  The  economy  shrank for a fourth consecutive quarter between
July and September, matching the longest decline ever as the
government’s budget-deficit cuts constrained household spending.  Weakening domestic demand is taming inflation, which pushed
the central bank to cut interest  rates  to effectively zero and
prompted talk of weakening the currency should the economy
require more policy easing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
