Israel ’s  government bonds  rose,
pushing the yield to a record low, on bets the central bank will
lower borrowing costs after the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development cut the nation’s growth forecast.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit notes due in
January 2022 fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to
3.86 percent at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv , the lowest
since they started trading in April 2011.  One-year interest-rate
swaps , an indicator of investor expectations for rates over the
period, fell for the third time in four days, retreating two
basis points to 1.79 percent.  The OECD today lowered its 2012 economic growth forecast
for Israel to 3.1 percent from its May estimate of 3.2 percent,
and cut its projection for next year to 2.9 percent from 3.6
percent. The central bank yesterday kept the key  interest rate 
at 2 percent after a surprise cut last month.  “The  Bank of Israel  couldn’t lower the rate for a second
consecutive month but is expected to cut it in the first quarter
of 2013 to support growth as inflation and consumer demand
slow,” said  Rafael Gozlan , chief economist at I.B.I.-Israel
Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel Aviv. “This environment is
giving preference” to government bonds that are not linked to
inflation “over consumer-price linked bonds.”        The yield
on the CPI bond due May 2017 rose for the first time since Nov.
21, increasing two basis points to 0.34 percent.  Rate Expectations  Twenty-two analysts  surveyed  by Bloomberg expected
yesterday’s central bank rate decision, while one forecast a
quarter-point cut. “Most indicators of real economic activity
that became available this month support the assessment that the
moderate growth of activity continues, and is expected to
continue in the coming months,” the central bank yesterday said
in its decision announcement.  The shekel weakened for the first time since Nov. 15,
depreciating 0.2 percent to 3.8590 a dollar at 4:37 p.m. in Tel
Aviv. Economic growth eased to 2.9 percent in the third quarter,
less than forecast, the slowest pace in three years.  Annual inflation slowed to 1.8 percent in October from 2.1
percent the previous month, the  Central Bureau of Statistics 
said Nov. 15, below the 2.2 percent median estimate of 14
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The government’s target range is
1 percent to 3 percent.  The two-year break-even rate, the yield difference between
the inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate government debt of
similar maturity, declined five basis points to 215, implying an
average annual inflation rate of 2.15 percent. The Tel Aviv Bond
40 Index, which measures inflation-linked and fixed-rate
corporate bonds, rose for a third day, increasing 0.1 percent to
279.96.  To contact the reporter on this story:
