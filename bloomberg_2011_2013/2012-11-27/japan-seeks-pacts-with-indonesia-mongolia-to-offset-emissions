Japan  is seeking agreements with
Indonesia and Mongolia to help offset its greenhouse gas
emissions by the end of the year, a government official said.  Japan wants to sign the technology-transfer pacts with the
countries by the end of this year, Masaya Okuyama, an
environment ministry official in charge of climate change, said
by phone today. Japan is also trying to get similar agreements
with Vietnam and  Bangladesh  by early next year, he said.  Tokyo  is developing a bilateral offset-credit mechanism to
cut carbon dioxide output by setting up energy management
systems and forest protection projects in developing countries
with Japanese technologies. Japan has conducted feasibility
studies in 30 countries, according to the foreign ministry’s
website.  Japan aims to use the mechanism to complement the Clean
Development Mechanism, a United Nations-backed program that’s
one of the pillars of the global carbon market.  At  UN climate talks  in Doha, Japan will promote the
bilateral program as a way to reduce greenhouse gases,
Environment Minister Hiroyuki Nagahama said today.  “If Japan’s technology provided to other countries can
reduce the impact of carbon dioxide, that means Japan plays an
important role as a developed nation,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
