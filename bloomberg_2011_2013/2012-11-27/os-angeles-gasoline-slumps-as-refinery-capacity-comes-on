Gasoline slumped for a second day in
 Los Angeles  as two refineries completed maintenance and boosted
production in the region.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  finished a vacuum tower project that will
maximize production of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel at the
Wilmington, California, refinery, Tina Barbee, a company
spokeswoman based in  San Antonio , said yesterday.  Phillips 66 (PSX) 
wrapped up planned work at a Los Angeles plant.  Together, the refineries will add 236,000 barrels a day of
capacity on the U.S. West Coast, which produced about 1.5
million barrels in the week ended Nov. 21, according to Energy
Department data. That’s the lowest level since Oct. 19 and the
smallest output for the season  since 2010 , data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Conventional, 85.5-octane gasoline, or Carbob, slid 3.75
cents to trade at a premium of 7.5 cents a gallon against
futures on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:46 p.m. New
York time. The same fuel was unchanged at a discount of 4 cents
versus futures in  San Francisco .  “Tesoro announced their vacuum unit going to operation and
the Los Angeles refinery is done with maintenance,” Bob Van der Valk, an independent pricing analyst in Terry, Montana.
“Everything is coming back online and that’s dragging the price
down.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
