Equity Residential (EQR)  and  AvalonBay (AVB) 
Communities Inc., the largest publicly traded U.S apartment
companies, fell after agreeing to buy landlord  Archstone Inc. (ASN) 
from  Lehman Brothers  Holdings Inc. in a $6.5 billion deal.  Equity Residential, based in Chicago, fell 2.1 percent to
$53.30 at 9:34 a.m. in New York. Arlington, Virginia-based
AvalonBay decreased 1.4 percent to $127.20.  The two REITs will pay Lehman Brothers $2.69 billion in
cash, along with stock in Equity Residential and AvalonBay
valued at a combined $3.8 billion, and assume $9.5 billion of
Archstone debt, New York-based Lehman said yesterday in a
statement after the close of regular trading. The deal will
result in Lehman and its affiliates owning 9.8 percent of Equity
Residential and 13.2 percent of AvalonBay.  The transaction may help the real estate investment trusts
grow quickly in markets where land is scarce and expensive.
Equity Residential is acquiring a 60 percent interest in
Archstone, including 78 properties with 23,110 units.
AvalonBay’s 40 percent purchase of Archstone includes 66
properties with 22,222 units.  Equity Residential’s properties will be located mostly in
Washington, D.C.;  San Francisco ; Southern California; and New
York, while AvalonBay’s will be chiefly in the mid-Atlantic
region and Southern California, the companies said yesterday in
separate statements.  IPO Scrapped  Equity Residential and AvalonBay have 120 days to complete
the purchase, Lehman said. The transaction replaces an initial
share sale of Archstone that was to raise as much as $3.45
billion for Lehman, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S.
history in September 2008 and is selling assets to satisfy its
creditors.  U.S. apartment occupancies rose in the third quarter at the
slowest pace in more than two years, as low  mortgage rates 
spurred would-be  renters  to buy homes instead. Rental revenue at
Archstone in the three months through Sept. 30 increased 8.3
percent to $272.7 million from a year earlier, according to a
regulatory filing. The company booked a loss of $176.6 million,
after a $106.2 million profit a year earlier.  Equity Residential fell 4.6 percent this year before today
and AvalonBay declined 1.3 percent, compared with an 11 percent
advance for the  Bloomberg REIT Index (BBREIT)  of 126 stocks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
