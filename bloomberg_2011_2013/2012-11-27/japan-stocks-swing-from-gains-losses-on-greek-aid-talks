     Nov. 27 (Bloomberg) --　Japanese  stocks  rose a fourth day
after euro-zone finance ministers agreed to ease  Greece ’s debt
burden and  Japan ’s opposition leader called for bold monetary
easing to weaken the yen.  Shimano Inc., a maker of bicycle parts that depends on
Europe for 36 percent of its sales, gained 0.9 percent in  Osaka .
 Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (8316) , Japan’s second-biggest
lender by market value, paced gains among banks.  TDK Corp. (6762) , a
maker of electronic components that depends on  China  for 27
percent of its sales, rose 0.5 percent after mainland industrial
profit growth accelerated in October.  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  added 0.4 percent to close at
9,423.30 in Tokyo. The broader Topix Index advanced 0.3 percent
to 781.60, with more than two stocks rising for each that fell.  Europe “jumped the latest hurdle in the debt crisis, and
the market is taking a sigh of relief,” said Hitoshi Asaoka, a
Tokyo-based senior strategist at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co., a
unit of Japan’s third-largest bank by market value. “Greece’s
budget crunch will probably resurface a few times.”  The Nikkei 225 gained 8.4 percent through yesterday from
Nov. 14, when Prime Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called for a Dec. 16
election, triggering speculation the opposition may win and call
for more monetary easing.  The Topix traded at 0.9 times book value as of yesterday,
compared with 2.1 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
that companies can be bought for less than the value of their
assets.  Stocks advanced after European finance ministers agreed to
cut Greece’s interest rates and gave it more time to pay back
rescue loans. The nation was also cleared to receive a 34.4
billion-euro ($44.7 billion) aid installment in December.  European Stocks  Companies that do business in  Europe  gained, with Shimano
adding 0.9 percent to 5,380 yen in Osaka. NTN Corp., a maker of
machinery parts that gets 26 percent of its sales in the region,
added 0.6 percent to 167 yen.  Shares also advanced today after Shinzo Abe, who polls
suggest may become Japan’s next premier after next month’s
election, said bold monetary easing will correct the yen’s
strength. The currency fell against all of its 16 major
counterparts.  “If politics lead a correction in the yen’s rise, that can
be a game changer for Japanese stocks that have lagged behind
since the Lehman Shock,” said Tetsuo Seshimo, a Tokyo-based
portfolio manager at Saison Asset Management Co., which manages
about 57 billion yen ($693 million).  Banks Rise  Sumitomo Mitsui added 1.4 percent to 2,623 yen.   Mitsubishi
UFJ Financial Group Inc. (8306) , Japan’s biggest lender, advanced 0.5
percent to 379 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent. The measure fell 0.2 percent yesterday as lawmakers
prepared to debate the so-called fiscal cliff, a series of
automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will occur unless
a budget compromise can be reached.  Chinese industrial companies’ profit jumped in October and
turned positive for the year as output accelerated and export
growth picked up following a seven-quarter economic slowdown.
Net income gained 20.5 percent from a year earlier to 500.1
billion  yuan  ($80.4 billion), the National Bureau of Statistics
said today in Beijing.  TDK advanced 0.5 percent to 3,270 yen.  Fanuc Corp. (6954) , a maker
of robots used in Chinese factories, gained 0.4 percent to
14,090 yen.  Trading volume on the Nikkei 225 was 7 percent above the
30-day average. The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY) 
dropped 3.5 percent to 18.20, indicating traders expect a swing
of about 5.2 percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30
days.  Steelmakers Drop  Steelmakers fell the most among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups after as Fitch yesterday cut the rating of Nippon Steel &
Sumitomo Metal Corp., citing a global downturn in the industry.
Nippon Steel slid 2 percent to 192 yen, while Nisshin Steel
Holdings Co. dropped 4.2 percent to 549 yen.  Kondotec Inc. plunged 7.9 percent to 457 yen after the
producer of construction materials said it planned to raise as
much as 713.7 million yen in a share sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
