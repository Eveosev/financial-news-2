The forint headed for the biggest
gain in more than a week as a deal among euro-area finance
chiefs on aid for  Greece  boosted demand for riskier assets,
outweighing  Hungary ’s fourth rate cut in as many months. .  The currency of the most indebted country in the east of
the European Union, advanced as much as 0.7 percent to 279.77
per euro, the most on a closing basis since Nov. 19. It traded
at 280.65 a euro as of 3:37 p.m. in Budapest. Yields on the
government’s benchmark three-year bonds rose two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.079 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank reduced its benchmark  interest rate 
by a quarter-point to 6 percent today, citing the “favorable
global financial environment” in a  statement . Emerging-market
assets rallied after European finance ministers eased the terms
of Greece’s debt payments.  “The improvements in the external environment are
supporting the domestic currency,” Gergely Gabler, a Budapest-
based analyst at broker Equilor Befektetesi Zrt., wrote in an e-
mailed report. “We expect further monetary policy easing as
long as the capital market environment remains favorable,”
Gabler said.  The central bank’s decision matched the forecast of 23
economists in a Bloomberg survey of 24 analysts, with one
expecting no change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
