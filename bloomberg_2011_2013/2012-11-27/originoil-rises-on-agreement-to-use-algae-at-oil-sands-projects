OriginOil Inc. (OOIL) , a Los Angeles-based
biofuel developer, gained the most in more than three weeks on a
deal to use its specialized algae to treat wastewater from
Canadian oil-sands projects.  OriginOil rose 3.6 percent to 87 cents at the close in New
York, the most since Nov. 2.  Ensteel Industries Ltd. , a Calgary-based specialty
fabricator, and LH Opportunity Group will collaborate on a
system that uses OriginOil’s algae to treat water used in
enhanced oil-recovery operations, according to a statement
today.  OriginOil’s algae may be used to produce biofuel or treat
wastewater. The company licensed its technology to LH
Opportunity and will receive a percentage of revenue from sales
of the planned systems, according to the statement.  OriginOil announced a similar agreement last month with
Pearl H2O LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
