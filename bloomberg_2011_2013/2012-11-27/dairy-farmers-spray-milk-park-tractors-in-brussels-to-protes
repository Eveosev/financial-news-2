Thousands of dairy farmers with
hundreds of tractors are demonstrating outside the European
Parliament in Brussels for a second day to protest milk prices
they say don’t cover costs, the European Milk Board said.  The protest was organized by the board to call for
“efficient rules” for the European Union milk market, it wrote
in a  statement  on its website yesterday. Television images
showed farmers yesterday using hoses to spray riot police with
milk. They demonstrated again today, a statement showed.  More than 157,000 dairy farmers in  Europe  have gone out of
business since a dairy-industry crisis in 2009, according to the
board. The 27-nation EU produces 31 percent of the world’s milk,
U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.  “There is an answer to the closure of farms,” Sieta van
Keimpema, vice-president of the board, was cited as saying in
today’s statement. “With the aid of a flexible supply
management a further bleeding of the milk market can be
prevented.”  The protests gathered 3,500 farmers with 1,000 tractors to
call for fair milk prices, according to the board. Belgian news
agency Belga counted 2,000 farmers with about 800 tractors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
