Vietnam ’s one-year bonds climbed,
pushing the yield to a three-month low, on speculation banks
stepped up debt purchases as slower lending left them with spare
cash. The dong was steady.  Outstanding loans rose 3.48 percent in the first 10 months,
compared with a 2012 target for an 8 percent to 10 percent
expansion, central bank Governor Nguyen Van Binh said in an
interview with Vietnam Investment Review yesterday. Lenders have
bought bonds as their cash increased, said Pham Phuong Lan, the
Hanoi-based head of fixed-income and currency trading at Bank
for Investment & Development of Vietnam.  “Liquidity at banks is still very good,” she said by
telephone today, citing a decrease in the  interbank overnight
deposit  rate. The rate, a gauge of funding availability, fell 26
basis points this month to 1.88 percent, according to daily
fixings by banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The  yield  on one-year notes fell eight basis points, or
0.08 percentage point, to 8.82 percent, according to a daily
fixing rate from banks compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest
decline since Oct. 31 and the lowest level since Aug. 23. The
yield on five-year bonds was steady at 9.88 percent.  Vietnam banks bought 89 percent of the 132.3 trillion dong
($6.3 billion) of securities issued by the government this year
as of Nov. 21, Dau Tu Chung Khoan magazine reported Nov. 23,
citing the Hanoi Stock Exchange.  The dong traded at 20,858 per dollar as of 4:10 p.m. in
Hanoi, unchanged from yesterday, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The State Bank of Vietnam set its reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
currency is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side
of the rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
