Corning Inc. (GLW) , the world’s largest
maker of glass for flat-panel televisions, rose the most in
seven months after forecasting stronger-than-expected retail
demand for consumer electronics this quarter.  The shares gained 6.9 percent to $12.13 at the close in New
York, for the biggest one-day gain since April 25. The stock had
dropped 13 percent this year through yesterday, dragged down by
concern that demand for liquid-crystal displays -- used in
everything from mobile phones to big-screen televisions -- was
slowing.  Corning,  which  makes the glass used in  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and
Samsung Electronics Co. devices, cited stronger TV sales in
North America and higher demand from the Chinese market ahead of
that nation’s New Year holiday. The Corning, New York-based
company said it now expects its Gorilla Glass product line to
generate about $1 billion this year.  “This announcement shows to people that there is some
growth left in the LCD glass business,” said Steven Fox, an
analyst with Cross Research in Livingston, New Jersey. “Apple
is obviously a big customer, but it’s beyond that.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
