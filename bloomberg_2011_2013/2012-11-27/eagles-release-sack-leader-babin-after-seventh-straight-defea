Philadelphia Eagles defensive end
 Jason Babin , the team’s sack leader, was released after the
team’s seventh consecutive loss dropped them to 3-8 this season.  Babin, 32, was a Pro Bowl player last season after
recording 18 sacks. He had 5.5 in 2012 and was cut today to give
the Eagles “an opportunity to give more playing time to some of
the younger guys in the defensive line rotation,” Eagles coach
 Andy Reid  said in a statement posted on the National Football
League team’s website.  Babin signed a five-year, $28 million contract with the
Eagles in July 2011, according to ESPN.  To contact the reporter on this story:
