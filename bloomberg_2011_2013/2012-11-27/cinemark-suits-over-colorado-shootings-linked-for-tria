Cinemark Holdings Inc. (CNK)  faces a trial
in May 2014 over claims that it failed to take security
precautions before the July 20 theater shootings that killed 12
people in Aurora, Colorado.  U.S. District Judge R. Brooke Jackson in Denver scheduled a
 jury trial  for May 5, 2014, as he consolidated seven suits over
claims that Cinemark USA Inc. failed to ensure the safety of its
theater property, according to court documents filed yesterday.  James Holmes, a former neuroscience student at the
University of Colorado-Denver, is charged in state court in
Centennial with 166 criminal counts, including more than 100 for
attempted murder. He allegedly opened fire on the audience at a
midnight showing of “The Dark Knight Rises.”  Jackson ruled yesterday that pretrial exchanges of
information in the cases will be delayed until he rules on
Cinemark’s efforts to have the litigation dismissed.  Plaintiffs in some of the cases allege that Cinemark had
information about previous disturbances at the theater,
including shootings, robberies and assaults.  The federal cases being consolidated include Nowlan v.
Cinemark USA Inc., 12-cv-02517, and Traynom v. Cinemark USA Inc.
12-cv-02514, U.S. District Court, District of  Colorado  (Denver).
The criminal case is People v. Holmes, 12-cr-01522, 18th
Judicial District Court, Colorado (Centennial).  To contact the reporter on this story:
