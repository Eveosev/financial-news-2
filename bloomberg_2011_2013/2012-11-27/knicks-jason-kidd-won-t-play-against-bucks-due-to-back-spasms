New York Knicks point guard  Jason Kidd  won’t travel to Milwaukee for tomorrow’s game against the
Bucks because of back spasms.  Kidd, 39, had started the Knicks’ first 12 games this
season before missing last night’s overtime loss to the Brooklyn
Nets. His status is considered day-to-day.  An 18-year National Basketball Association veteran, Kidd
averaged 8 points, 3.4 assists and 3.3 rebounds in 26 minutes a
game as the Knicks started 9-3 before last night’s loss in
Brooklyn. The NBA’s active leader in assists, Kidd signed with
New York in July and has helped the team average a league-low
11.4 turnovers a game.  “He’s a big part of what we do,” Knicks coach  Mike Woodson  said of Kidd after last night’s game. “He’s one of
those veteran guys who can settle things down and help run the
team when things aren’t going smoothly.”  The Knicks, who at 9-4 are tied for first place in the
Eastern Conference’s  Atlantic Division , return home after
tomorrow’s game in Milwaukee for games against the  Washington
Wizards  on Nov. 30 and the Phoenix Suns on Dec. 2.  To contact the reporter on this story:
