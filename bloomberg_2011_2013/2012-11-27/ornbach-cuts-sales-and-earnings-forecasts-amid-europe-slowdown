Hornbach Holding AG (HBH3) , a German home-
improvement retailer in which  Kingfisher Plc (KGF)  owns a stake, cut
its annual sales and earnings forecasts because of weakening
consumer confidence across Europe.  Earnings before interest and tax in the fiscal year through
February will be less than the previous year’s record 169
million euros ($219 million), the Neustadt an der Weinstrasse,
Germany-based company said today in a statement. Revenue will be
about the same as the prior year’s 3.2 billion euros, according
to the retailer, which had previously been forecasting “low
single-digit” percentage growth in sales.  Hornbach  preferred shares  fell as much as 3.9 percent in
Frankfurt trading, the steepest drop since Sept. 27, and was
down 2.2 percent at 53.71 euros as of 4:21 p.m. Kingfisher slid
as much as 0.8 percent in  London , erasing earlier gains, and was
down 0.3 percent at 275.5 pence as of 3:52 p.m. local time.  Kingfisher owned a 21 percent holding in Hornbach as of
September. The U.K. company initially bought a 12.5 percent
stake in 2001.  Today’s revised forecasts reflect “the unfavorable
macroeconomic framework in Europe,” said Hornbach, which got 58
percent of sales from Germany in its last financial year. The
remainder of revenue comes from European countries including the
Netherlands, Sweden, Austria, Switzerland and Romania.  Metro AG (MEO) , Germany’s biggest retailer, cut its profit
forecast on Oct. 5, saying Europe’s sovereign-debt crisis was
weighing on sales in the south and east of the region.  To contact the reporter on this story:
