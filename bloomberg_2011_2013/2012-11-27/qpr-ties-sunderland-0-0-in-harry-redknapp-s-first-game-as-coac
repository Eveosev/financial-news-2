Queens Park Rangers drew 0-0 at
Sunderland in Harry Redknapp’s first game as manager of the
winless English Premier League soccer club.  QPR remains in last place with five points after 14 games.
Redknapp was named manager on Nov. 24, one day after Mark Hughes
was fired by the west London club.  Aston Villa beat Reading 1-0 on Christian Benteke’s goal in
the 80th minute to move out of the three relegation places at
the bottom of the standings. Reading remains next to last, four
points ahead of QPR.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
