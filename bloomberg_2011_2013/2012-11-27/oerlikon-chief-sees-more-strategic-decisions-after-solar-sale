Oerlikon’s Chief Executive Michael Buscher said the sale of a solar business for 250 million Swiss
francs ($269 million) may be followed by other “strategic
decisions” that draw on the company’s enhanced financial
strength.  The sale of the unit to  Japan ’s  Tokyo Electron Ltd. (8035) 
highlights a revamp of the Swiss company, which included
negotiating a 1.48 billion-franc debt facility.  “It’s obvious that with strong operational results, and
the credit facility that we set up, that those achievements give
flexibility in strategic decisions going forward,” Buscher, who
has led the Pfaeffikon-based firm since 2010, said in a
telephone interview. He declined to specify whether purchases or
divestments are planned.  The stock has risen 85 percent this year as Buscher
divested peripheral units, including a textile-equipment
business in July. Oerlikon signed the contract to sell the solar
unit in March and was expecting the deal to close last quarter.
The division makes equipment and production lines that companies
such as  Sharp Corp. (6753)  use to make thin-film modules with silicon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
