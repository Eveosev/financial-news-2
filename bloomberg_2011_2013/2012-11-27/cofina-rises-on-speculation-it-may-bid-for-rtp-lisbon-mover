Cofina SGPS SA (CFN)  rose for a fourth
day, climbing to the highest in almost three months, as
investors speculated that the Portuguese news publisher may bid
for state-owned broadcaster RTP.  The  stock  climbed 13 percent to 65.6 euro cents, the
highest close since Sept. 4, giving the company a market value
of 67.3 million euros ($87 million) and taking the advance in
the past four sessions to 62 percent. Trading volume was almost
seven times higher than the three-month daily average.  “Investors may be increasing their stakes in Cofina with
the expectation that the company may be able to buy RTP,” said
Diana Gomes, a trader at Orey iTrade in Lisbon.  The  Portuguese government  reiterated on July 10 that it
plans to sell one of RTP’s two channels. Cofina owns five
newspapers, including business daily Jornal de Negocios, and
nine magazines in  Portugal . Laurentina Martins, an investor
relations official at Cofina, wasn’t immediately available for
comment on her office phone.  Cofina’s biggest shareholders include Credit Suisse Group
AG, Caderno Azul SPS and Newshold SGPS, according to  data
compiled  by Bloomberg.  Impresa SGPS SA (IPR) , Portugal’s second-biggest media company by
revenue, gained 17 percent to 34 cents in the Portuguese
capital.  Impresa may be “benefiting from the growing investor
interest in the Portuguese media sector,” Francisco Goarmon, a
trader at Probolsa in Lisbon, said in a phone interview. “I see
no other reason for the rise in Impresa shares today.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
