Inflation in the German state of
North Rhine-Westphalia held steady in November.  The inflation rate in  Germany ’s most populous state
remained at 1.9 percent, the state’s statistics office in
Dusseldorf said in a statement today. In the month, consumer
prices fell 0.1 percent.  Economists predict that pan-German inflation, calculated
using a harmonized European Union method, will slow to 2 percent
from 2.1 percent in October, according to the median of 23
estimates in a Bloomberg News  survey . The Federal Statistics
Office is due to publish that report, based on data from six
states, tomorrow.  Oil prices  have declined about 11 percent this year as a
cooling global economy curbs demand.  Europe ’s sovereign debt
crisis is also damping German economic growth, leaving companies
with less room to raise prices. The Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development today cut its forecasts for German
expansion to 0.9 percent for this year and 0.6 percent for 2013.  “For a change, inflation is not a big concern for Germany
right now,” said  Alexander Koch , an economist at UniCredit
Group in Munich. “It will hover around the 2 percent mark for
the foreseeable future, meaning we don’t have any deflationary
risks either.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
