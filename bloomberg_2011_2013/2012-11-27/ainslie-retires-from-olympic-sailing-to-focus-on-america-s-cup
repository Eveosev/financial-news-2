Four-time Olympic sailing champion
Ben Ainslie won’t be competing for Britain at the 2016 Rio
Games.  “Sad to be announcing Olympic retirement but it’s been a
great ride and I have to say a huge thanks to all those who
helped make it possible,” Ainslie said on Twitter today.  Ainslie, 35, won silver in Atlanta in 1996 in the Laser
class, and went on to win gold in the same class four years
later at the Sydney Games. He then switched to the larger Finn
class, winning gold medals at  Athens  in 2004, Beijing in 2008
and his home Olympics this summer in  London .  The ten-time world champion, the first person to win medals
in five different Olympic sailing events, said in a column
published in the U.K. Daily Telegraph today that he wants to
focus on trying to win the America’s Cup for Britain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
