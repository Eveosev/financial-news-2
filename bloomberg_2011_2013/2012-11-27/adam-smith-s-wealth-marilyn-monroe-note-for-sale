A first edition of Adam Smith’s “An
Inquiry Into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations”
could sell for as much as $120,000 at auction next month.  Published in 1776, the volume is among almost 300 lots of
rare books and manuscripts expected to tally as much as $8
million at the  Profiles in History  sale on Dec. 18. The pieces
are part of a single, anonymous collection.  The group includes letters signed by U.S. presidents George  Washington  and Thomas Jefferson, artists Vincent van Gogh and
Paul Gauguin, monarchs Napoleon and Peter the Great, composers
Richard Wagner and Ludwig van Beethoven, baseball legends Joe DiMaggio and Babe Ruth. The catalog offers translations.  In his two-page letter to the Reverend Jonathan Boucher on
Aug. 15, 1798 from Mount Vernon, Washington writes, “Peace,
with all the world is my sincere wish. I am sure it is our true
policy.”  The lot is estimated at $200,000 to $300,000.  Less than seven months before his death, van Gogh wrote a
letter to “M. & Mme. Ginoux,” his friends and owners of the
Cafe de la Gare in Arles; Madame Ginoux was the subject of
several portraits. Written in French on grid paper, it is signed
“Vincent” and dated Jan. 20, 1890.  “As for me, illness has done me good -- it would be
ungrateful not to acknowledge that,” van Gogh writes. The item
is estimated at $200,000 to $300,000.  Wagner, Napoleon  More affordable are four letters written and signed by
Wagner. Each carries a $6,000 to $8,000 estimate.  “I am ashamed!” Wagner writes to Princess Carolyne Sayn-
Wittgenstein, the mistress of composer Franz Liszt, on Jan. 22,
1854. “I certainly did torment Franz cruelly; may he forgive me
for it!”  Napoleon’s March 30, 1807 note to General Jean Rapp, one of
his official aides-de-camp, is estimated at $4,000 to $6,000.  Marilyn Monroe’s undated letter to her friend and neighbor
Norman Rosten, written on Waldorf-Astoria stationery, has many
corrections and strikethroughs.  “I use to write poetry sometimes but usually I was very
depressed at those times and the few (about two) people said
that it depressed them, in fact one cried but it was an old
friend I’d known for years,” Monroe writes in the letter,
estimated at $30,000 to $50,000.  The collection will be previewed from Dec. 3 to 9 at
 Douglas Elliman’s Madison Avenue Gallery , 980 Madison Ave. The
auction will take place on Dec. 18 via Internet and phone.  Norman Rockwell  Norman Rockwell’s painting “Willie Gillis: Package From
Home” is expected to bring $3 million to $5 million at
Susanin’s Auctions in Chicago on Dec. 1.  Originally published on the cover of the Saturday Evening
Post on Oct. 4, 1941, the image was the first of 11 featuring
the Willie Gillis character.  The 1941 oil-on-canvas shows him as a low-ranking soldier
carrying a care package, with a group of taller and higher-
ranking servicemen behind him.  “The package probably contains cookies or sweet treats,”
said Sean Susanin, president of the auction house. The other men
“are following him to see if he will share the treats with
them.”  The work has been consigned by an international corporation
with headquarters in  Chicago , Susanin said, declining to
specify. It was gifted to the company in 1968 and has never been
exhibited.  “It hung in the CEO’s office,” said Susanin. “No one
knew where it was.”  In 1970, the owner was listed as Chicago-based CNA
Insurance, according to the Norman Rockwell Museum.  ‘Santy Claus’  The painting has the highest estimate of the Rockwell lots
offered this week. American art sales at Christie’s and
Sotheby’s will have 11 works by the artist. “When the Doctor
Treats Your Child” (1939) is estimated at $800,000 to $1.2
million, leading a group of six works at Sotheby’s on Nov. 29.
“Deer Santy Claus,” which was discovered in a closet in
 California  after having been missing for decades, could bring
$300,000 to $500,000 on Nov. 28 at Christie’s.  Rockwell’s auction record was set when his “Breaking Home
Ties” (1954) fetched $15.4 million at Sotheby’s in 2006. In
2002, another wartime painting, “Rosie the Riveter,” sold for
$4.9 million at Sotheby’s. It is currently in the collection of
 Alice Walton ’s Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in
 Bentonville ,  Arizona .  “There aren’t many Rockwell trophies left out there,”
Susanin said. “The Norman Rockwell Museum holds most of them.”  Henri Matisse  With artworks by Henri Matisse bringing as much as $48.8
million at auction, Christie’s online-only sale of the French
master’s multiples seems downright affordable.  The 96 lots have been consigned by the artist’s family,
with bids starting at $1,000. A 1929 etching of a naked woman
curled on the floor is estimated at $4,000 to $6,000. Another
nude is sitting by a fish bowl wearing nothing but slippers. The
estimate is $5,000 to $7,000.  Both are executed with deftness, immediacy and intimacy.
The top estimates don’t exceed $50,000. The auction, expected to
tally $800,000, ends on Dec. 4 at

Russell  on architecture.  To contact the reporters of this story:
