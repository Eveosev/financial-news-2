Barclays Plc (BARC) ’s investment-banking
unit asked a court to dismiss a lawsuit claiming it made
misleading statements about mortgage-backed securities it sold
to two credit unions that later failed.  The National Credit Union Administration, a U.S. regulator,
filed its claims too late, Barclays argued in papers filed
yesterday in federal court in  Kansas  City, Kansas.  The NCUA accused the unit, formerly known as Barclays
Capital Inc., of breaching state and federal law when it
allegedly made misrepresentations in the course of selling
securities valued at more than $555 million to the U.S. Federal
Credit Union and to the Western Corporate Federal Credit Union
between February 2006 and June 2007.  Both credit unions were placed under the agency’s
conservatorship in March 2009, then into liquidation in 2010.
The NCUA sued in September.  “Years before the statute of limitations expired, the NCUA
warned the credit unions of the risks that lay at the heart of
the complaint’s allegations,” Barclays said.  Federal law required the NCUA to file its claims within one
year after the alleged violations were, or could have been,
discovered, according to the London-based bank. Barclays also
said the offering materials accurately disclosed the risks.  The NCUA filed a similar lawsuit in the same court in
October against a  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  unit.  The case is National Credit Union Administration v.
Barclays Capital, 12-cv-2631, U.S. District Court, District of
Kansas (Kansas City).  To contact the reporter on this story:
