The European Union will delay rather
than lose a vote on a plan to temporarily fix an oversupply in
its carbon market,  UBS AG (UBSN)  said.  “Five east European countries are against the proposal and
 Germany  is likely to abstain due to the differences in opinions
between the environment ministry supporting the proposal and the
economics ministry which is firmly against it,” Per Lekander,
an analyst for the bank in Paris, said today in an e-mailed
research note. “This is a sufficient amount of votes not to
achieve the required two-thirds majority.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
