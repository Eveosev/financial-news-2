Dutch sales of antibiotics for use
in livestock fell 51 percent in the first half of 2012 compared
with the same period three years ago, amid a government push to
cut veterinary use of antimicrobial drugs.  “We’re pleased with these promising results,” Agriculture
Minister Co Verdaas and Health Minister Edith Schippers wrote in
a  letter  to parliament today. “This indicates that the
reduction goal of 50 percent set for 2013 may already be
achieved in 2012.”  Sales of antibiotics in the  Netherlands  for use in animal
husbandry fell to an estimated 244 metric tons in the first six
months of the year, compared to 495 tons in the 2009 reference
period, according to data from Wageningen University.  The Dutch government has set a target to cut antibiotics
use in farm animals by 50 percent next year compared with the
2009 level to address bacterial resistance. The Netherlands had
one of the highest rates of veterinary use of antibiotics in
 Europe  in 2010, government data show.  The Netherlands ranked fifth out of 20 European countries
in 2010 in terms of antibiotic sales for use in farm animals,
using harmonized data, according to the letter. Only  Hungary ,
Spain,  Belgium  and  Portugal  had higher sales, while Dutch sales
of veterinary antibiotics were 10 percent higher than those in
France, about double the level in the U.K. and 90 percent higher
than in  Sweden .  First-half sales of “critical” antibiotics of the
fluoroquinolone variety fell 23 percent from three years ago,
while sales of third- and fourth-generation cephalosporin
antibiotics fell 92 percent, the ministers wrote.  The Netherlands has the highest density of hogs and cattle
of the 27 countries in the European Union, with about 291 pigs
and 77 cows per square kilometer (0.4 square mile), based on
Eurostat data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
