The  London  Olympic Park will undergo
a 292 million pounds ($468 million) refurbishment before
reopening to the public next year.  Temporary venues, walkways and stands used during this
yearâ€™s Olympics will be cleared over the next 18 months while
the park is connected to the surrounding area in east London
with new roads and pathways, the London Legacy Development Corp.
said today in an e-mailed statement.  The park will re-open in phases, starting July 27, 2013,
exactly a year after the opening ceremony. The work is scheduled
to be completed by the spring of 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
