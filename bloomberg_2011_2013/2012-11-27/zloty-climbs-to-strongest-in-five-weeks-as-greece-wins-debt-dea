The zloty jumped to the strongest
level in more than five weeks and  Poland ’s bond yields fell as
European officials eased the terms on emergency aid for  Greece ,
boosting risk appetite for emerging-market assets.  The zloty appreciated as much as 0.2 percent to 4.0907 per
euro, the strongest level since Oct. 18, and traded at 4.0965 as
of 5:04 p.m. in Warsaw. The yield on five-year notes fell five
basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 3.72 percent.  Euro-region finance ministers cut the rates on Greece’s
bailout loans, suspended interest payments for a decade, gave
the nation more time to repay and engineered a bond buyback. The
country was also cleared to receive a 34.4 billion-euro ($44.7
billion) loan instalment in December. Emerging-market stocks
rose to the highest level in almost three weeks.  “The zloty is benefiting from improved sentiment on global
markets,”  Bank Pekao SA (PEO)  economists led by Marcin Mrowiec in
Warsaw wrote in an e-mailed note today. “While the decision to
releases another aid tranche for Greece was to be expected, it
supported optimism and demand for riskier assets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
