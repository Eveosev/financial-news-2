Energy XXI Bermuda Ltd. (EXXI) , owner of a
15.8 percent stake in the Davy Jones prospect, said a decision
on how to proceed with the No. 1 ultra-deep well in the U.S.
Gulf of Mexico may come in the next several months.  A second well at the site may be completed in late summer
or early fall, John Schiller, chairman and chief executive
officer of Hamilton, Bermuda-based Energy XXI, said in an
interview at the Howard Weil Energy Conference in New Orleans
today.  A successful flow test for Davy Jones No. 1 has been
repeatedly delayed as operator  McMoRan Exploration Co. (MMR)  contended
with stuck drilling equipment and other blockages at the well,
which is about 5.5 miles (8.8 kilometers) deep and located in
shallow water 12 miles off the coast of  Louisiana .  McMoRan, owner of 63.4 percent of Davy Jones, said Jan. 30
it was developing plans to pump hydraulic fracturing fluid into
the well to help unblock it.  To contact the reporter on this story:
