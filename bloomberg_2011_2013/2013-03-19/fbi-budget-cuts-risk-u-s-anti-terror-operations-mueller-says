The Federal Bureau of Investigation
has reduced training and travel, delayed information-technology
upgrades and faces the equivalent of 2,200 vacancies due to the
budget cuts that went into place March 1, Director Robert Mueller said.  Mueller, who has led the FBI since 2001, told a House
Appropriations subcommittee today that the reductions will
result in around $550 million in cuts to the bureau’s budget and
may result in furloughs.  “We have planned for the possibility of furloughs,”
Mueller told the lawmakers. “Any furlough would pose a risk to
FBI operations, particularly in the areas of counter-terrorism
and cyber.”  U.S. lawmakers are considering spending bills that may give
the FBI more flexibility with its funds or, in the case of a
House measure, restore some of the funds.  Representative Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican and
chairman of the  panel , said he would be willing to approve FBI
requests to move funds within the bureau if needed. Lawmakers,
who provide funds for the agencies tied to specific purposes,
are generally required to sign off on any efforts to move those
funds elsewhere.  Congress mandated $1.2 trillion in across-the-board cuts
over nine years, including $85 billion over the next seven
months, as part of a 2011 deal to increase the U.S. debt limit.  Mueller predicted the more than 2,000 vacancies estimated
to occur because of the budget cuts would set FBI personnel back
almost two years.  “It’s going to hurt tremendously,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
