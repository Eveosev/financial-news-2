Apollo Global Management LLC’s  CKE (APO) 
Restaurants Inc., the parent of Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s, is
marketing $1.05 billion of bonds linked to the company’s assets,
including franchise fees.  This is the first so-called whole-business, asset-backed
offering for CKE, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified because terms aren’t
public. Barclays Plc is arranging the sale for the Carpinteria,
California-based company.  Companies have sold about $50 billion in bonds tied to
consumer and business borrowing this year, with deals linked to
automobiles accounting for $21 billion in sales, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Issuance of deals that reference
unusual collateral such as franchisee fees, wireless cellphone
towers and timeshare payments are poised to climb as investors
seek out riskier assets with the Federal Reserve holding its
benchmark lending rate close to zero into a fifth year.  American Tower Corp. (AMT) , the owner and operator of wireless
and broadcast communications sites, sold $1.8 billion of
securities tied to wireless towers on March 6, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The 10-year portion of the sale ranked
AAA priced to yield 3.089 percent, the data show.  Ford Motor Co. (F)  sold 2.71-year, BBB-rated bonds linked to
auto debt, the largest part of asset-backed market, to yield
1.797 percent on March 12, Bloomberg data show.  Esoteric Deals  Other companies that have tapped the asset-backed market to
fund their businesses with transactions similar to CKE’s include
Sonic Corp. and Domino’s Pizza Inc., Bloomberg data show.  So-called esoteric asset-backed deals, which are offerings
linked to collateral outside of the auto loans, credit-cards and
student loans that have traditionally accounted for the bulk of
sales, gained attention in 1997 when banks arranged $55 million
of so-called Bowie Bonds, tied to royalties from rock icon  David
Bowie . Other musicians that have tapped the asset-backed market
for cash include  James Brown  and the Isley Brothers, according
to Moody’s.  Columbia Lake Acquisition Holdings Inc., an affiliate of
 Leon Black ’s Apollo, acquired CKE in July 2010, according to a
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
