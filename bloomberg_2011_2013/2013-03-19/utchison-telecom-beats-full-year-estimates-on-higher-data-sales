Hutchison Telecommunications Hong
Kong (215)  Holdings, the phone carrier controlled by billionaire  Li Ka-shing , posted full-year profit that narrowly beat estimates
as mobile-phone customers increased their data usage.  Net income rose 20 percent to HK$1.23 billion ($160
million) in 2012, the Hong Kong-listed company said in a
statement today. That compares with the HK$1.19 billion average
of eight  analyst estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year
revenue rose 16 percent to HK$15.5 billion.  Hutchison is targeting data users for its faster third-
generation and fourth-generation networks as competition from
Hong Kong CSL Ltd. and SmarTone Telecommunications Holdings Ltd.
crimps profitability. The company also is expanding its fixed-
line business.  “More people could have adopted higher usage of its
service plans,” Victor Yip, an analyst at  UOB-Kay Hian Holdings
Ltd. (UOBK)  in Hong Kong, said before the earnings. “It also might
have reduced marketing expenses on its fixed-line business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
