Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, a
unit of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc., will provide a
“significant amount” of the debt financing needed to build
Cape Wind Associates LLC’s 468-megawatt wind farm off the coast
of Massachusetts.  The developer signed a term sheet to engage the bank,
Boston-based Cape Wind said today in a statement. Construction
is expected to begin in Nantucket Sound by the end of this year.  Barclays Plc is advising Cape Wind on raising the remaining
financing. The project may cost about $2.6 billion and has
power-purchase agreements with utilities Nstar and  National Grid
Plc (NG/)  to buy about 78 percent of its output, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
