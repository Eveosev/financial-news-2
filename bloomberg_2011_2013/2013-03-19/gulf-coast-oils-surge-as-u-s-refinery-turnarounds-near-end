Gulf Coast  oils strengthened in the
 spot market  as the bulk of spring refinery maintenance is
ending, bringing back demand for crude.  Planned turnarounds between January and March took 1.13
million barrels a day of crude processing capacity offline,
according to IIR Energy, a  Sugar Land , Texas-based energy-
information provider. From April to June, that figure will drop
to 676,000 barrels.  Offshore oils Light Louisiana Sweet and Heavy Louisiana
Sweet strengthened, with LLS gaining 95 cents to a $22.25
premium over U.S. benchmark West  Texas  Intermediate oil, as of
11:05 a.m. New York time, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. HLS widened its premium by 90 cents to $23.25.  Several refineries finished or were near finishing
maintenance this week and next.  In the Midwest, Husky Energy Inc.’s 160,000-barrel-a-day
 refinery in Lima , Ohio will return from a maintenance shut down
next week, a spokesman said in an e-mail yesterday.  Phillips
66 (PSX) ’s Wood River,  Illinois ,  refinery  returned a 120,000-barrel-a-
day crude unit to full rates, a person familiar with the matter
said yesterday. A 150,000-barrel-a-day unit at the plant is at
half-capacity and expected to return to full rates within a
week.  On the Gulf Coast,  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO) ’s  Port Arthur ,
Texas,  refinery  restarted its 57,000-barrel-a-day hydrocracker
over the weekend after it had been shut since March 7 for
repairs, a spokesman said by e-mail yesterday.  WTI-Brent  The increased demand due to refinery restarts also
supported the price of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
for domestic crude, over international Brent prices. The
 discount  of WTI to Brent narrowed by 50 cents to $14.90 at 12:50
p.m.  New York  time.  LLS’s  premium  to Dated Brent jumped to $7.57 a barrel, the
highest level since October 2008.  Other Gulf Coast oils also strengthened. Poseidon’s premium
gained $1.25 to $18.45 a barrel. Mars Blend’s premium added
$1.35 to $18.15.  Thunder Horse  and Southern Green each
strengthened by 65 cents to trade at $20.15 and $15.25 above
WTI, respectively.  In Texas’s Permian Basin, WTI Midland strengthened by 5
cents to trade at a 20-cent discount to the same grade delivered
to the U.S. supply hub in Cushing,  Oklahoma .  In  Canada , the prices of Western Canada Select and Syncrude
grades were unchanged. Index trading for April delivery for the
grades ended on March 15. The majority of the volume in Canadian
grades is traded during the index period, which begins on the
first of the month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
