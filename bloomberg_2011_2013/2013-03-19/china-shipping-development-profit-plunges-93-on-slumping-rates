China Shipping Development Co. (1138) , the
commodities-carrying unit of the nation’s No. 2 shipping
company, said annual profit plunged 93 percent in 2012 on
slumping freight rates.  Net income  tumbled to 73.7 million  yuan  ($11.9 million)
from with a profit of 1.06 billion yuan a year earlier, the
company said in a filing to the Shanghai stock exchange today.
The Shanghai-based company was projected to post a  net loss of
244 million  yuan based on the average of 10 analysts’ estimates
complied by Bloomberg. Sales fell 9.2 percent.  China Shipping Development sought to delay receiving new
ships in August after slumping rates caused a net loss of 495
million yuan in the first half. Sluggish demand and excess
capacity in international and domestic markets resulted in a
downturn in freight rates, China Shipping said in a statement in
January when it warned of a “considerable decline” in annual
profit.  The Baltic Dry Index, the benchmark rate index for hauling
commodities, averaged 920 last year, the lowest since 1986,
according to figures from the Baltic Exchange, the London-based
publisher of freight rates. The index gained 0.8 percent to 899
points in  London  yesterday.  China Shipping fell 0.7 percent to HK$4.16 at the close in
Hong Kong trading, before the earnings were released. Its
Shanghai shares also dropped 1.1 percent to 4.39 yuan today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
