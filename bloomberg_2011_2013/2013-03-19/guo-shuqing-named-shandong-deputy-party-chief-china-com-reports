Guo Shuqing, the former chairman of
the China Securities Regulatory Commission, was appointed deputy
Communist Party secretary of Shandong Province, the China.com
news website reported today.  Guo, 56, said Shandong faces a critical transition period
and he will work to improve people’s lives, according to the
report, which cited a meeting of the provincial party committee.  The announcement comes after the Communist Party’s top two
leaders, Xi Jinping and Premier  Li Keqiang , took their state
posts of president and premier last week, completing the
country’s once-a-decade leadership transition. After leading the
CSRC since 2011, Guo was replaced yesterday by former  Bank of
China Ltd. (3988)  Chairman Xiao Gang.  Under Guo, the CSRC expanded foreign investor quotas to buy
stocks, cut trading fees and pushed companies to increase
dividends.  “Comrade Guo Shuqing has a firm political stand and a
strong sense of the overall situation,” Shandong Party
Secretary Jiang Yikang said, according to China.com. “He is
honest, upright, frank and principled and is strict with
himself.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
