Samsonite International Sa (1910) , the
world’s largest branded-luggage maker, plans to raise prices in
Japan by as much as 12 percent as a weaker yen cuts the dollar
value of sales in the country.  The increase starts April 1, Ramesh Tainwala, president for
Asia Pacific and Middle East, told reporters in Hong Kong today.  The luggage maker joins international companies including
 LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC)  and  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  in
increasing prices in response to the yen’s 18 percent drop
against the dollar over the past six months. The yen has
depreciated as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe talked down the value
of the currency, promising to implement policies to stimulate
the economy and have Japan’s central bank set a 2 percent
inflation target.  Samsonite gained 4.6 percent, the biggest advance since
Feb. 28, to close at HK$18.38 in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang
Seng Index  was little changed, losing 0.2 percent.  The Louis Vuitton brand in February raised prices in Japan
by the most on record.  Japan this month reported its economy returned to growth in
the fourth quarter as the yen extended the drop that began when
Abe’s election campaign kicked off mid-November.  Samsonite’s Japan sales rose about 27 percent to $66
million in 2012. The company expects the Japan market to expand
by 20 percent to 25 percent this year, Chief Financial Officer
Kyle Gendreau said.  Profit rose 71 percent from the previous year to $148.4
million in 2012, the company said today in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
