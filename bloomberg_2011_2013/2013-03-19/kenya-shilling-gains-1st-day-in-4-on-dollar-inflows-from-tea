Kenya’s shilling strengthened for
the first time in four days after dollar inflows from tea sales
and as investors awaited the outcome of a challenge to this
month’s presidential election.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy gained as
much as 0.2 percent to 85.55 per dollar and traded at 85.65 by 1
p.m. in the capital, Nairobi.  Kenya, the world’s biggest exporter of black tea, holds its
weekly auction of tea at the sea port of  Mombasa  on Tuesdays.
Outgoing Prime Minister Raila Odinga, whose dispute of the 2007
election triggered ethnic clashes that left more than 1,100
people dead, filed a petition on March 16, challenging the
election of Uhuru Kenyatta as president during the March 4
elections. The nation’s highest court has 14 days to rule.  “The shilling has received support from inflows of dollars
from the sale of tea,” John Muli, a dealer at Nairobi-based
African Banking Corp., said by phone. “There is subdued demand
for dollars as the market adopts a wait and see attitude
following the filling of the case challenging the presidential
elections.”  The court challenge is still a concern for the market and
the shilling is likely to trade within a range of 85.60 to 86.20
per dollar today, Nairobi-based NIC Bank Ltd. said in a note to
clients.  The shilling rose 0.9 percent from the March 4 vote to
March 13, when demand for dollars picked up after business
resumed. Since then, the currency has slipped 0.5 percent.  The Central Bank of  Kenya  offered 10 billion shillings
($116 million) in seven-day repurchase agreements, an official
who asked not to be identified in line with policy said by phone
today. The bank uses the repos to reduce money supply and
support the shilling.  Uganda’s currency weakened for the second day, dropping
less than 0.1 percent to 2,634.63 per dollar, while the
Tanzanian shilling depreciated 0.3 percent to 1,628.35 per
dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
