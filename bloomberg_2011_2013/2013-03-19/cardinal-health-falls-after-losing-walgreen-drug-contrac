Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH) , the second-
largest U.S. drug distributor by revenue, dropped the most in
almost four years after the company lost a contract to supply
 Walgreen Co. (WAG) ’s pharmacies.  Cardinal fell 8.2 percent to $42.35 at the close in New
York, its largest one-day decline since June 2, 2009. The shares
have gained 2.7 percent in the past 12 months.  The contract with the largest U.S. drugstore chain expires
at the end of August and won’t be renewed, Dublin, Ohio-based
Cardinal said today in a statement. The move won’t hurt earnings
for the 2013 fiscal year ending in June. Walgreen and Alliance
Boots GmbH said they agreed to a partnership with
 AmerisourceBergen Corp. (ABC)  to distribute drugs in a 10-year deal.  “We anticipate that investors’ sense of urgency to buy
into shares could be limited for now,” Thomas Gallucci, an
analyst with Lazard Capital Markets in  New York , said in a note
to clients. Gallucci downgraded his rating on Cardinal’s stock
to neutral.  Cardinal will target a 2014 diluted earnings per share
similar to its fiscal 2013  forecast  of $3.42 to $3.50 provided
on Feb. 5, George Barrett, the company’s chairman and CEO, said
in a statement.  “Although we are not yet ready to provide fiscal 2014
earnings guidance, our portfolio has considerable balance and we
have prepared strategies to mitigate the impact of” the
nonrenewal, Barrett said.  Walgreen, based in Deerfield,  Illinois , is one of the drug
distributor’s two largest customers and sales to the drugstore
chain generated about 21 percent of the company’s consolidated
revenue for fiscal 2012, Cardinal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
