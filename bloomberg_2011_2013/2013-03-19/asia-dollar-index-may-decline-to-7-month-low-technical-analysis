An index based on a trade-weighted
basket of Asian currencies against the  U.S. dollar  is likely to
decline to the lowest level in more than seven months, Citigroup
Inc. said, citing technical patterns.  The JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index, which includes currencies
such as South Korea’s won, the  Singapore dollar  and  Thai baht ,
may approach the 200-week moving average of 114.60 should it
close below support at 116.70 to 116.81, Daniel Tobon, a New
York-based analyst at Citigroup, wrote in a note to clients. The
ADXY Index was little changed at 117.32 as of 6:29 a.m. in
London from yesterday, when it declined to as low as 117.15, the
weakest level since Oct. 11.  “The ADXY Index continues to move lower towards support at
116.70-116.81, where the 55 day moving average and upward
sloping trend line converge,” Tobon wrote. “A close below
there would open the way to” 114.60, according to Tobon.  The trendline connects the lows touched in March 2009 and
June 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The ADXY
Index last touched 114.60 on July 26.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns to forecast changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index. Support refers to an area on a
chart where analysts anticipate orders to buy may be clustered.  To contact the reporter on this story:
