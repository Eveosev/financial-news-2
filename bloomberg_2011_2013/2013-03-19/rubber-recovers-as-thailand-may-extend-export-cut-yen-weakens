Rubber rebounded from the biggest
drop in almost eight months as  Thailand  said it would propose
extending a reduction in shipments. The Japanese currency
weakened, making yen-based contracts more attractive.  The contract for delivery in August gained 0.9 percent to
273.3 yen a kilogram ($2,863 a metric ton) on the Tokyo
Commodity Exchange. Futures plunged 4.2 percent yesterday, the
most since July.  Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, who represent 70 percent
of global output, will meet in Phuket on April 10-12, Deputy
Farm Minister Yuttapong Charasathien said today. The yen
weakened for the first time in four days against the dollar,
trading at 95.55, before a change of leadership at the  Bank of
Japan  takes effect tomorrow amid expectations for policy easing.  “Thailand’s proposal to extend the export cut helped move
the market,” Sean Kan, a commodity broker at Okachi & Co., said
by phone from Tokyo. “If the three countries decide to extend
the program, prices could rise further.”  The contract for September delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange gained 0.9 percent to close at 22,470  yuan  ($3,615) a
ton. Thai rubber free-on-board remained unchanged at 85.60 baht
($2.92) a kilogram today, the Rubber Research Institute of
Thailand said on its website. That was the lowest level since
November 2009, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
