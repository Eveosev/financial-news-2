Palm oil  gained on speculation that
stockpiles in Malaysia, the world’s second-largest producer, may
decline as exports increase.  The contract for delivery in June advanced as much as 1.7
percent to 2,426 ringgit ($777) a metric ton on the Malaysia
Derivatives Exchange, and was at 2,420 ringgit at 4:08 p.m. in
Kuala Lumpur. Futures have lost 28 percent in the past year.  Exports from Malaysia gained 4.6 percent to 678,829 tons in
the first 15 days of this month from the same period in
February, surveyor  Societe Generale  de Surveillance said March
15. Inventories have dropped to 2.44 million tons in February
from an all-time high of 2.63 million tons in December,
according to the Malaysian Palm Oil Board.  “Inventory will continue to decline from here,” Alvin Tai, an analyst at OSK Investment Bank Bhd., said by phone in
 Kuala Lumpur . By May or June, “it will probably drop to 2.1
million tons or 2.2 million tons. Shipment numbers were up by
just a few percent but that’s probably going to be good enough
to help the inventory water down further.”  Malaysia retaining a tax on crude palm oil shipments at 4.5
percent for a second month in April will “be supportive for
exports,” Tai said.  Soybean oil  for May delivery climbed 0.4 percent to 49.86
cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while soybeans
gained 0.2 percent to $14.125 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for September delivery increased 0.9
percent to close at 6,332 yuan ($1,019) a ton on the  Dalian
Commodity Exchange . Soybean oil advanced 0.7 percent to end at
8,108  yuan  a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
