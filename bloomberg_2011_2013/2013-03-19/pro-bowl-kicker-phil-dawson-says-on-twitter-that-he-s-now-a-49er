Phil Dawson has signed with the San
Francisco 49ers, the free-agent kicker said in a Twitter post.  Dawson, who played his first 14 National Football League
seasons with the Cleveland Browns, made the announcement after
thanking Cleveland fans for a “tremendous ride.”  “I am humbled and thrilled to have the opportunity to
continue my career with my new team, the SF 49ers,” Dawson said
on Twitter.  Bob Lange, a spokesman for the 49ers, said in an e-mail
that the team doesn’t have anything to report at this time.  Dawson, 38, was selected for his first Pro Bowl last season
after making 29 of 31 field-goal attempts, including all seven
from more than 50 yards. He’s 29th in NFL history, and seventh
among active players, with 1,271 points scored.  The 49ers released David Akers on March 6, a month after he
kicked three field goals in the 49ers’ 34-31 Super Bowl loss to
the Baltimore Ravens. Akers’s 69 percent success rate last
season was the lowest of his career and below the NFL average of
84 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
