U.S.  stocks  fell, sending the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index to its longest slump of the year, as
Cypriot lawmakers’ rejection of a bank levy overshadowed data
showing growth in new-home construction.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. tumbled 6.6 percent as
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecast for iron-ore prices.
Electronic Arts Inc. slumped 8.3 percent after the video-game
maker ousted its chief executive officer. Cardinal Health Inc.
fell 8.2 percent after saying its contract with Walgreen Co.
won’t be renewed. Walgreen rose 5.4 percent and
AmerisourceBergen Corp. surged 3.6 percent after agreeing to a
partnership.  The  S&P 500  fell 0.2 percent to 1,548.34 at 4 p.m. in New
York, after dropping as much as 0.9 percent earlier. The gauge
lost 1 percent over three days, the longest streak since Dec.
28. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  added 3.76 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 14,455.82. About 6.8 billion shares traded
hands on U.S. exchanges today, or 7.4 percent above the three-
month average.  “Obviously the situation in  Europe  is not what we want it
to be,”  John Manley , who helps oversee about $223.6 billion as
chief equity strategist for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in New
York, said in a phone interview. “The next couple weeks will be
more periods of chopping around. I don’t think it’s more than 2
to 4 percent in terms of risk on the market,” he said. “The
housing market does seem to be on a bit more steady ground and
that helps U.S. consumers.”  Stocks fell as Cyprus’s parliament rejected an
unprecedented levy on  bank deposits , dealing a blow to European
plans to force savers to shoulder part of the country’s bailout
in a standoff that risks renewed tumult in the euro area.
Hammered out by euro-area finance chiefs at the weekend, the
deal had sought to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) by
drawing funds from Cyprus bank accounts in return for 10 billion
euros in international aid.  ‘As Needed’  Equities  trimmed  losses late in the trading day after the
 European Central Bank  reaffirmed its commitment to provide
liquidity “as needed within the existing rules.”  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  rose earlier as a Commerce Department report
showed builders broke ground on 917,000 homes at an annual rate,
up 0.8 percent from a revised 910,000 pace in January that was
higher than initially estimated.  Building permits , a proxy for
future construction, advanced 4.6 percent to 946,000, the
strongest since June 2008.  The  bull market  in U.S. equities entered its fifth year
this month. The S&P 500 has more than doubled from its bottom in
2009, driven by better-than-estimated corporate  earnings  and
three rounds of bond purchases by the Fed. The S&P 500 rose to
within two points of its 2007 record last week while the Dow
reached an all-time high.  Fed Meeting  The  Federal Open Market Committee  began a two-day meeting
today. The policy makers agreed in December to link record-low
 interest rates  to thresholds for unemployment and inflation so
that investors and households know what conditions will prompt
the  Federal Reserve  to consider raising  rates .  The push by Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to continue record
stimulus faltered with the Jan. 3 release of minutes from the
FOMC’s December meeting, which said several officials favored
slowing or stopping bond buying well before the end of 2013.  “I don’t think there is any mystery at all,” Christopher Beck, senior vice president at Delaware Investments, said in a
phone interview. His firm had more than $179 billion under
management as of as of Dec. 31. “The Fed is not going to change
the tone. They’re going to confirm the easing bias.”  Volatility Index  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
measures the cost of using options as insurance against declines
in the S&P 500, jumped 7.7 percent to 14.39 today, after surging
18 percent yesterday. The gauge, known as the  VIX (VIX) , is down 20
percent this year.  Six out of 10 S&P 500  groups  retreated as energy, consumer-
discretionary and financial companies fell the most, sinking at
least 0.5 percent.  Cliffs Natural Resources Inc., the biggest U.S. iron ore
producer, tumbled 6.6 percent to $20.33. Goldman Sachs trimmed
its price forecast on the commodity, citing seaborne expansion
projects and increasing production in  China .  Chesapeake Energy Corp. slumped 5.1 percent to $21.04.
Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc., the world’s second largest
copper miner, slid 1.6 percent to $32.98.  Electronic Arts dropped 8.3 percent to $17.15. The second-
largest U.S. maker of video games said John Riccitiello is
stepping down as chief executive officer and warned quarterly
results may fall short of forecasts.  Juniper Networks  Juniper (JNPR)  Networks Inc. fell 5.3 percent to $19.14. Goldman
Sachs downgraded the No. 2 maker of networking gear to sell from
neutral, citing competition from Cisco Systems Inc. and Alcatel-
Lucent.  Cardinal dropped 8.2 percent to $42.35 after saying its
pharmaceutical distribution contract with Walgreen won’t be
renewed after it expires in August. Walgreen accounted for about
21 percent of Cardinal’s revenue in 2012.  Walgreen, the largest U.S. drugstore chain, and Alliance
Boots GmbH agreed to a long-term partnership with
AmerisourceBergen, gaining the right to acquire a minority stake
in the pharmaceutical services provider. Walgreen also reported
second-quarter earnings that topped analysts’ estimates.  AmerisourceBergen surged 3.6 percent to $50.06 and Walgreen
rallied 5.4 percent to $44.74.  EBay Inc. climbed 2 percent to $51.10. The operator of the
world’s largest online marketplace is overhauling fees for
sellers for the first time since 2010, seeking to reduce costs
and make pricing less complicated as it competes with bigger
rival Amazon.com Inc. for online merchants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
