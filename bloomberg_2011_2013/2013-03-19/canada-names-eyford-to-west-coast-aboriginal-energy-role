Canada appointed a special
representative to address concerns raised by west coast
aboriginals about energy projects such as pipelines.  Lawyer Douglas Eyford will consult aboriginal communities
in British Columbia and Alberta on issues such as environmental
impacts, employment and economic benefits, Natural Resources
Minister Joe Oliver said in the text of a speech provided by his
office. Eyford will report to Prime Minister Stephen Harper.  Some aboriginal groups have opposed pipeline projects such
as  Enbridge Inc. (ENB) ’s proposed Northern Gateway, which would carry
crude from the Alberta oil sands to the coast of British
Columbia for export.  “It is essential that we work closely with First Nations
communities, in order to incorporate their knowledge and
experience,” Oliver said in the speech in Terrace, B.C.  To contact the reporter on this story:
