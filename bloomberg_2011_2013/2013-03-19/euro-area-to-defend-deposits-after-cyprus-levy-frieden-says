Euro-area finance ministers will
“do whatever it takes” to protect bank accounts after their
“unique” decision on a deposit tax in Cyprus as part of a
rescue package, Luxembourg Finance Minister Luc Frieden said.  “Whatever it will take today, tomorrow, in the days to
come, we will make sure that deposits in  Europe  are safe,”
Frieden said in an interview with David Tweed on Bloomberg
Television today. “Although this is far from being a perfect
decision,” the Cyprus deal “cannot be seen as destroying the
confidence that people should have in the European financial
sector,” he said.  Frieden’s comments echoed those of his Dutch counterpart,
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, and others. Dijsselbloem, head of the group
of euro-area finance ministers, said today that a bank-account
levy “won’t happen in other countries because their banking
industries aren’t as unbalanced as in Cyprus.” He was referring
to the size of Cyprus’s financial sector compared with gross
domestic product.  Euro-area finance ministers last week agreed to a tax on
Cypriot bank deposits as officials unveiled a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) rescue for the country’s government and banks. The
levy is intended to raise 5.8 billion euros.  “This is a unique Cyprus solution,” Frieden said, and it
“cannot be simply copied to other situation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
