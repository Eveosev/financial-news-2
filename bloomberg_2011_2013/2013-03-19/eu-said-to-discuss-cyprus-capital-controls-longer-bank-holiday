European policy makers are in
Cyprus discussing further capital controls and the extension of
a bank holiday through to the end of the week, said a European
official familiar with the talks.   No decisions have been made yet, said the person, who spoke
on condition of anonymity because the discussions are
confidential. The officials, which come from the  European
Central Bank , the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Commission, may wait until the outcome of an ECB Governing
Council meeting that starts in Frankfurt tomorrow, said the
person.   The Cypriot parliament today rejected an unprecedented levy
on  bank deposits , dealing a blow to European plans to force
depositors to shoulder part of the countryâ€™s rescue in a
standoff that risks renewed tumult in the euro area.   To contact the reporter on this story:
