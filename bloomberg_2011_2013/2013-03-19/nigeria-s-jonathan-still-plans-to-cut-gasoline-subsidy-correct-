(Corrects president’s name in headline)  Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan said  Africa ’s top oil producer is still planning to
withdraw a gasoline subsidy after discussing with the public the
easiest way to do it.  “We cannot continue to waste resources meant for a greater
number of Nigerians to subsidize the affluent middle class, who
are the main beneficiaries,” Jonathan said today at a
conference in Lagos, the commercial capital.  Jonathan’s attempt to scrap the gasoline subsidy on Jan. 1,
2012, without prior announcement sparked a week of strikes and
protests, forcing the government to partially reinstate them,
raising the price to 97 naira ($0.61) a liter (0.26 gallon) from
65 naira. Jonathan increased last year’s 888 billion-naira
budget for the subsidy with 161 naira billion in December.  Nigeria sets gasoline prices by subsidizing oil importers
such as the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. and
Total Nigeria Plc because the country doesn’t have the refining
capacity to meet domestic demand.  To contact the reporters on this story:
