The yield on  Taiwan ’s 20-year bonds
climbed to the highest level in 17 months after demand dwindled
at an auction. The local currency gained.  Taiwan sold NT$40 billion ($1.3 billion) of similar-
maturity notes yesterday at 1.847 percent, compared with the
1.80 percent median estimate of fixed-income traders in a
Bloomberg survey. Investors bid for 1.26 times the amount on
offer, down from 1.42 times at the previous sale on Jan. 23.  “The 20-year bond auction was pretty bad,” said  Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader in Taipei at Cathay United Bank Co.
“There is some selling pressure on long-term bonds.” Some
investors may be looking at alternatives such as yuan-
denominated securities sold in Taiwan, he said.  The yield on the 1.5 percent debt due January 2033
increased four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 1.86
percent, according to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the
highest level for a benchmark 20-year  note  since October 2011.  Deutsche Bank AG,  Germany ’s largest lender, won approval
from Taiwan’s central bank to sell $1 billion of foreign-
currency bonds on the island, according to a person familiar
with the matter who asked not to be named because the details
are private. The monetary authority will also allow the lender
to sell  yuan  debt, the person said.  Currency Market  Chinatrust Commercial Bank issued securities in the Chinese
currency last month in what the government said was the debut
sale of the so-called Formosa bonds.  The  Taiwan dollar  rose 0.05 percent to NT$29.801 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on prices from Taipei Forex Inc. The
currency was up 0.2 percent in the last two minutes of trading
before paring its advance. The central bank has sold the local
currency near the close on most days in the past year, according
to traders who asked not to be identified.  Taiwan’s central bank hasn’t devalued the local dollar
continuously in the past 15 years, Governor Perng Fai-nan said
yesterday in response to lawmakers’ questions.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped two basis
points to 3.47 percent.  The  overnight interbank lending rate  held at 0.387 percent,
according to the Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
