Cooper-Standard Holdings Inc. (COSH)  rose
the most in more than 18 months after the auto-parts supplier
announced plans to buy back as much as $200 million of its
stock.  The shares rose 14 percent to $41 at the close in New York,
the biggest one-day gain since Aug. 31, 2011. As a result of
today’s trading, they have increased 7.9 percent this year
compared with a rise of 8.6 percent for the Standard & Poor’s
500 Index.  Cooper-Standard, based in Novi, Michigan, said in a
statement that it would repurchase as many as 4.65 million
shares of its stock, about 21 percent of its shares outstanding
on a fully diluted basis, for $43 each. The offer represents a
19 percent premium to yesterday’s closing price of $36 and 14.5
percent to the year-to-date volume-weighted average price of
$37.56.  The company, whose products include door seals, fuel lines
and engine mounts, said it expects to use cash and borrow as
much as $175 million to pay for the shares. The tender offer is
scheduled to start the week of April 1 and last for at least 20
business days, Cooper-Standard said.  In a separate statement, Cooper-Standard said it’s making a
private offering of $175 million in notes due 2018 in connection
with the stock buyback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
