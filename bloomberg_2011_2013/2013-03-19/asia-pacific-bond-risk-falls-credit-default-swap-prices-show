The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
decreased, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 3 basis points to 102.5 basis
points as of 9:24 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The gauge is set for its lowest close
since March 15, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 3 basis points to
105.5 as of 11:12 a.m. in Sydney, according to National
Australia Bank Ltd. prices. The benchmark is down from the
highest close since March 13 yesterday, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index fell half a basis point to
105.8 basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge yesterday closed at its highest
level since March 7, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
