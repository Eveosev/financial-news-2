OAO Mobile TeleSystems (MBT) ,  Russia ’s
largest wireless-service provider, boosted fourth-quarter profit
by 39 percent, beating analysts’ estimates as subscriber numbers
increased and customers spent more browsing the Web.  Net income rose to $547 million from $394 million a year
earlier, the company, known as MTS, said today in a statement.
Analysts  projected  $466 million, the average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Sales gained about 6 percent to $3.17
billion, also beating estimates.  MTS, controlled by billionaire Vladimir Evtushenkov, added
1.8 million subscribers for a total of 101 million, and data
revenue in Russia rose by about a third. The company wants to
improve its profit margin after it fell below the level of its
peers in the fourth quarter.  The margin for operating income before depreciation and
amortization shrank by 2.1 percentage points to 40.7 percent of
sales as the company invested in expansion of its retail network
and shut operations in  Uzbekistan . Rival OAO MegaFon had a 43.9
percent Oibda margin in the fourth quarter, while  VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) 
had 41.1 percent.  MTS said it’s targeting a margin of 41 percent to 42
percent in 2013 to 2015. The operator wants to boost revenue
5 percent to 7 percent in local currencies this year from the
equivalent of $12.4 billion last year and plans capital spending
of 20 percent of sales, it said.  The stock rose as much as 2.4 percent and was up 2 percent
at $20.40 per American depositary receipt at 10:55 a.m. in  New
York . That extended the gain this year to 9.4 percent.  The board will meet in April to determine the size of 2012
dividends, Chief Financial Officer Alexey Kornya told reporters
in Moscow today. Management will propose paying dividends of at
least 18.3 rubles (59 cents) a share, or $1.2 billion in total,
he said.  MTS posted net income of $1 billion last year. Excluding
impairment costs and court claims in Uzbekistan, profit was $2
billion, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
