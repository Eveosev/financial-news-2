Bad loans as a proportion of
lending at Spanish banks resumed their increase in January in a
sign that asset quality remains under pressure after state-aided
lenders transferred soured real estate risk to a bad bank.  Non-performing loans as a proportion of total lending
climbed to 10.8 percent in January from 10.4 percent in the
previous month as 3.2 billion euros ($4.1 billion) of loans
soured, the Bank of Spain in Madrid said on its website today.
That’s up from 8.1 percent a year ago.  Bad loans  continue to rise in Spain as the International
Monetary Fund predicts the economy will shrink 1.5 percent this
year and the unemployment rate will hit 27 percent, making it
harder for borrowers to keep up credit payments. The bad-loans
ratio dipped in December from a record of 11.4 percent in
November as lenders, including Bankia group, that have taken
state aid transferred soured real estate assets to a bad bank.  The shrinking  loan books  of Spanish banks are also
contributing to a higher bad-loans ratio. Lending fell 1.3
percent in January from December and 11 percent from a year ago,
according to the Bank of Spain.  To contact the reporter on this story:
