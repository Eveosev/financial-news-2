Derek Jeter  is listed as day-to-day
by the  New York  Yankees after tests on his surgically repaired
ankle revealed mild inflammation.  The 38-year-old shortstop missed the Yankees’ spring
training game yesterday because of soreness in his left ankle,
which he broke Oct. 13 during Game 1 of last year’s American
League Championship Series.  The Yankees said in a statement yesterday that Jeter, who
was cleared to return to baseball activities on March 7,
underwent a precautionary X-ray that showed no fracture.  “I was told that you’re going to feel it, not necessarily
in the ankle but around the ankle, just because I was in a boot
for so long that you come out and it’s going to take some time
to strengthen it,” Jeter told reporters. “It’s normal. You’ve
just got to deal with it and move on.”  Jeter has played in five games since his return to action,
batting .273 with one double and no runs batted in. He batted
.316 with an American League-best 216 hits last season.  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said Jeter could be the team’s
designated hitter instead of at shortstop when the Major League
Baseball regular season opens April 1 against the  Boston Red
Sox .  “I’d like to have him at shortstop on opening day, but if
we collectively feel he could use a few more days, we’ll wait,”
Girardi said. “I’ve said all along we’ve got to play it by ear.
My goal is to have him at shortstop, and that’s his goal. But we
might have to make some adjustments on the fly.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
