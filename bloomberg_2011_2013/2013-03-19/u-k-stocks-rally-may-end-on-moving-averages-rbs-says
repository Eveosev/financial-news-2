U.K. stocks  may decline 3 percent
as the moving averages signal the nine-month rally in the
benchmark index is about to end, according to a technical
analyst at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc.  The Moving Average Convergence-Divergence, or MACD, line
for the FTSE 100 Index has crossed below its nine-day moving
average, suggesting its momentum has turned adverse, Dmytro Bondar, a technical market strategist at RBS in London, wrote in
a message.  “MACD is making a negative cross,” Bondar said. “What’s
more important, it’s displaying a negative divergence with the
price action, which usually precedes trend reversal points.”  If the gauge breaches 6,390, it could drop to as low as
6,260, Bondar said. A break below that level would lead the
index lower to 6,210, 6,140 and eventually 6,080, he added.  The  FTSE 100 (UKX)  fell 0.5 percent to 6,457.92 yesterday.  A candlestick chart of the FTSE 100 confirms the bearish
momentum, having formed a “dark cloud cover” last week,
according to Bondar. This pattern is identified by a security
rising one day, closing near its high, and falling the next day,
closing near its low.  U.K. stocks have rallied 23 percent since a low in June as
European Central Bank President Mario Draghi pledged to preserve
the euro and U.S. lawmakers agreed on a compromise budget.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
