Australia will today introduce
legislation to make it easier for individual investors to buy
and sell corporate bonds.  The changes will simplify compliance, alter directors’
liabilities and facilitate the transfer of securities from the
wholesale  bond market , according to an e-mailed statement from
Treasurer  Wayne Swan .  The bill is part of efforts by Prime Minister  Julia
Gillard ’s government to encourage pension savers to buy more
fixed-income securities. The country’s retirement funds have the
highest allocation to equities and the second-lowest holdings of
bills and bonds among 29 nations tracked by the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development.  “This is a really important reform for Australian
companies to help them tap into our growing self-managed
superannuation savings pool as another source of funding,” Swan
said in the statement.  Australia’s benchmark  stock index  swung from a 41 percent
drop in 2008 to a 31 percent gain the following year, and has
risen 7.3 percent in 2013. The nation’s corporate bonds have
produced positive returns every year since Bank of America
Merrill Lynch index data began in 1997, gaining 0.5 percent so
far this year.  The legislation follows the passage of laws last year to
allow retail trading of federal  government securities .  To contact the reporter on this story:
