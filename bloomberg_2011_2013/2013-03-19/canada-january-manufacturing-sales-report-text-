The following is the text of
 Canada â€™s manufacturing shipments report for January released
by  Statistics Canada .  Manufacturing sales edged down 0.2% in January to $48.0
billion, the fourth decline in five months. Sales in January
were down in the transportation equipment industry as well as
the petroleum and coal product industry. Overall, 7 of 21
industries posted lower sales in January, representing
approximately 52% of the manufacturing sector.  Durable goods sales declined 0.7% to $24.1 billion, while
non-durable goods sales rose 0.3% to $23.9 billion.  Constant dollar sales fell 0.4% in January, indicating that
the decline in manufactured goods sold was a result of lower
volumes.  Unfilled orders increased 5.8% to $69.0 billion in January,
the highest level since November 2008 ($69.3 billion). The gain
stemmed almost entirely from higher unfilled orders in the
aerospace product and parts industry. Unfilled orders are a
stock of orders that will contribute to future sales assuming
that they are not cancelled.  Sales decline in the transportation equipment industry  Sales declined 3.8% to $7.5 billion in the transportation
equipment industry. The decrease mostly reflected a 19.7% drop
in production in the aerospace product and parts industry. The
aerospace industry is one of the more volatile industries in the
manufacturing sector. A 3.7% decline in the motor vehicle
assembly industry also contributed to the decrease in
transportation equipment sales.  Petroleum and coal product sales decreased 1.8% to $7.0
billion in January. The decline mostly reflected lower sales
volumes.  Sales in the  food industry  were down 1.3% to $6.7 billion,
the fourth decline in five months. The level in January was the
lowest since September 2010.  Sales down in four provinces  Manufacturing sales decreased in  Quebec , Ontario,  New
Brunswick  and Saskatchewan.  In Quebec, sales declined 2.7% to $11.3 billion, the
largest decline since July 2012. The decrease was primarily
caused by lower production in the aerospace product and parts
industry.  Manufacturing sales in Ontario were down 0.8% to $21.6
billion. The decrease reflected a 3.2% decline in the motor
vehicle assembly industry and a 5.9% drop in the petroleum and
coal product industry.  Sales in New Brunswick dropped 6.7% to $1.6 billion,
primarily as a result of lower sales in the non-durable goods
industries.  In Saskatchewan, sales were down 4.9% to $1.1 billion,
mostly because of declines in the durable goods industries.  In  Alberta , sales rose 6.3% to $6.3 billion, the largest
increase since November 2011. The gain was a result of increases
in the petroleum and coal product (+7.6%), chemical (+11.0%) and
machinery (+17.2%) industries. The gain in the machinery
industry reflected higher sales of oil and gas field equipment.  Inventories rise  Inventory levels were up 1.7% to $65.4 billion in January.
The gains were led by the aerospace product and parts, and
primary metal industries.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, inventories
were up 4.1% to $5.0 billion, with two-thirds of the gain
stemming from higher goods-in-process inventories while the
remainder was caused by increased finished product inventories.  Primary metal inventories were up 2.4% to $7.7 billion, as
a result of higher volumes held by manufacturers rather than
price changes.  Inventories were also up in the petroleum and coal (+2.6%),
fabricated metal (+2.3%), and the electrical equipment (+9.1%)
industries.  The inventory-to-sales ratio rose from 1.34 to 1.36 in
January, the highest level since June 2011.  Substantial gains in new and unfilled orders  In January, new orders increased 5.1% to $51.8 billion.
Most of the gain was attributable to increases in the aerospace
product and parts and machinery industries.  Unfilled orders rose 5.8% to $69.0 billion in January. The
increase was almost entirely caused by a gain in the aerospace
product and parts industry.  In the aerospace product and parts industry, unfilled
orders rose 10.0% to a record high of $39.6 billion. The gain in
January was the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Since
September 2012, unfilled orders in the  aerospace industry  have
advanced 26.2%.  Unfilled orders were up 2.6% to $7.2 billion in the
machinery industry. The gain followed seven months of declines.  Manufacturing at a glance: Unfilled orders  Between January 1997 and January 2013, total unfilled
orders rose from $30.1 billion to $69.0 billion, while sales
during the same period increased from $34.8 billion to $48.0
billion. Hence, unfilled orders rose by 128.9% compared with a
38.0% increase in sales. Unfilled orders represent the backlog
of orders held by a company at a particular point in time that
will contribute to future sales, assuming orders are not
cancelled.  On average, 96.0% of unfilled orders are concentrated in
industries which manufacture durable goods. Between January 1997
and January 2013, unfilled orders in transportation equipment
increased from $15.4 billion to $45.8 billion, and on average
accounted for 57.5% of total orders. Over the same period, the
aerospace product and parts industry was the largest contributor
among all manufacturing industries and accounted for 73.5% of
the unfilled orders in the transportation equipment industry.  Other industries which held a sizeable share of total
unfilled orders included machinery manufacturing, fabricated
metal products and computer and electronic products
manufacturing. From January 1997 to January 2013, these three
industries contributed an average of 13.1%, 8.7% and 7.1% to
total unfilled orders respectively.  The effect of recent economic downturns on unfilled orders  Directly preceding the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009,
total unfilled orders peaked at $69.3 billion in November 2008.
Over the course of the next year, unfilled orders decreased
sharply to $51.0 billion by November 2009. In comparison, during
the economic downturn in 2001 and 2002, total unfilled orders
decreased from $50.3 billion in July 2001 to $34.3 billion in
December 2003, representing a 31.9% decrease over 29 months.
However, this decline was more gradual than the recent decrease
in unfilled orders, which fell 26.5% over 12 months.  Despite differences in the duration of the decline in
unfilled orders, there was a noticeable parallel in the months
following each of these economic events. In both cases, total
unfilled orders maintained a consistent level for approximately
one year before beginning to increase. After decreasing to a low
of $34.3 billion in December 2003, total unfilled orders
maintained an average level of $36.3 billion before beginning to
consistently increase starting in January 2005. Similarly, after
reaching a low of $51.0 billion in November 2009, total unfilled
orders maintained an average level of approximately $52.4
billion before beginning to rise starting in January 2011.  After unfilled orders reached their cyclical low of $34.3
billion in December 2003 it took 38 months for them to reach
their previous high of $50.3 billion. In the current business
cycle, 38 months have also passed since unfilled orders reached
their cyclical low of $51.0 billion. At approximately $400
million short of their highest level, unfilled orders are again
displaying similar patterns in recovery.  Note to readers  Monthly data in this release are seasonally adjusted and
are expressed in current dollars unless otherwise specified.
Preliminary data are provided for the current reference month.
Revised data, based on late responses, are updated for the three
previous months.  Non-durable goods industries include food, beverage and
tobacco products, textile mills, textile product mills, clothing,
leather and allied products, paper, printing and related support
activities, petroleum and coal products, chemicals, and plastics
and rubber products.  Durable goods industries include wood products, non-
metallic mineral products, primary metal, fabricated metal
products, machinery, computer and electronic products,
electrical equipment, appliances and components, transportation
equipment, furniture and related products and miscellaneous
manufacturing.  Production-based industries  For the aerospace industry and shipbuilding industries, the
value of production is used instead of sales of goods
manufactured. This value is calculated by adjusting monthly
sales of goods manufactured by the monthly change in inventories
of goods in process and finished products manufactured.  Unfilled orders are a stock of orders that will contribute
to future sales assuming that the orders are not cancelled.  New orders are those received whether sold in the current
month or not. New orders are measured as the sum of sales for
the current month plus the change in unfilled orders from the
previous month to the current month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
