Rates to ship  iron ore , coal and
grains rose for the longest streak in almost a year on
speculation Chinese demand increased. Earnings are still below
last year’s average.  The Baltic Dry Index gained for a 15th straight session,
adding 1.4 percent to 912 today, according to the  Baltic
Exchange , the London-based publisher of shipping costs. That’s
the longest streak since March 30, 2012. Daily earnings for
Capesizes, the largest ships tracked by the gauge, rose 1.7
percent to $4,977, according to the exchange.  Six Capesizes were booked to  China , including two from
 Brazil , after several days of few charters, Sam Margolin, an
analyst at Cowen Securities LLC in New York, said in an e-mailed
report today. The ships are still earning less than the $7,758
they need to cover operating costs such as crew and maintenance,
according to estimates from Moore Stephens LLP, an accountant
and consultant. The Baltic Dry Index averaged 920 in 2012.  “Rates remain low, but steady,” Margolin said in the
report.  Gains extended across the other vessel types tracked by the
index. Daily earnings for Panamaxes rose for a 30th session,
increasing 1 percent to $9,465, according to the exchange.
Supramaxes gained 1.4 percent to $9,934, and Handysizes
increased 1.7 percent to $7,765, figures showed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
