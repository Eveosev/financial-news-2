China  increased approvals for wind
farms to try to reach a goal of having 100 gigawatts of the
energy installed by 2015 while easing grid bottlenecks.  The National Energy Administration approved 28.7 gigawatts
of wind farms, up from 27.5 gigawatts granted in 2012, it said
today in a  statement  on its website. The permits exclude  Inner
Mongolia , Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces, where the grid has
been overloaded with the carbon-free energy.  China has slowed construction of onshore wind farms, adding
15.9 percent in 2012, 18 percent less than a year earlier,
according to data from Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Since 2011,
the NEA has required local authorities to seek its approval
before adding capacity after new plants clogged grids.  The approved plants, which include four pilot projects
totaling 750 megawatts, will probably be developed from 2015
onwards, Demi Zhu, a Beijing-based analyst from NEF, said by e-
mail. The regions excluded this time “have been suffering
significant grid curtailments,” she said.  China will work to improve connections of wind power to
grids, the NEA said in a separate website  statement  today. The
nation will raise the proportion of wind power consumption in
power use from the current 2 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
