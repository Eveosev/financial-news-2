Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co. (600418) ,
Ltd. slumped the most in more than four years in Shanghai
trading after the automaker announced the biggest recall of
vehicles in China since November.  Shares of Anhui Jianghuai dropped by its 10 percent daily
limit to 6.41  yuan  in Shanghai trading, the biggest decrease
since February 2009. The stock was suspended yesterday. The
benchmark Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.8 percent to 2,257.43.  The Anhui-based carmaker will recall 117,072 Tongyue model
cars in China starting March 30, China’s quality regulator  said 
on its website today, after a  China Central Television  reported
the company sold vehicles with rusted chassis. The recall
underscores the quality concerns dogging Chinese automakers as
they continue to lose market share to foreign brands owned by
 General Motors Co. (GM)  and Volkswagen AG.  Rusting on the Tongyue occurred because the vehicles, first
introduced in 2008, didn’t meet some technical standards, the
company said in a statement to the  Shanghai Stock Exchange 
today, following CCTV’s annual consumer rights program on March
15 that also singled out Volkswagen vehicles with defective
gearbox systems.  Jianghuai Auto has produced 119,271 Tongyue cars as of Dec.
31, 2011 and the recall will have some impact on its 2012
financial results, the company said in the statement.  China has introduced recall laws this year that give the
country’s quality watchdog broader powers to order
investigations and impose fines should manufacturers and
importers fail to recall faulty products in a timely manner.  Volkswagen (VOW)  said on March 16 it plans to recall vehicles in
China after CCTV said some owners reported abnormal vibrations,
loss of power and sudden acceleration in their cars. In
November, a unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co. widened an
initial recall to 255,958 vehicles due to risks of leakage from
improperly placed fuel tanks.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
