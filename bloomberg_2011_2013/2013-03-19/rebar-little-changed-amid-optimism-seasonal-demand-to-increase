Steel reinforcement-bar futures
were little changed amid expectations that seasonal demand will
pick up in the spring, helping traders reduce inventory after
prices declined in the past four weeks.  Rebar for delivery in October on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was at 3,833  yuan  ($616) a metric ton at 10:15 a.m.
local time, trading between a gain of 0.4 percent and loss of
0.3 percent. The contract dropped to a three-month low of 3,741
yuan a ton on March 14 and has declined 3.9 percent this year.  The  average spot price  of rebar gained yesterday for the
first time since Feb. 20, advancing 1.1 percent to 3,694 yuan a
ton, according to data from Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  “The spot price has become more resilient, showing early
signs of a pick-up in demand that will help destock high
inventory and support futures,” Wu Zhili, analyst at Shenhua
Futures Co. said in a report today.  Raw-material  iron ore  for immediate delivery was unchanged
at $134.60 a ton yesterday, according to data compiled by The
Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
