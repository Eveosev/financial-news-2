U.K. stocks  declined for a third
day, for the longest streak of losses this year, as Cypriot
lawmakers wrangled over a bank-deposit levy.  Rio Tinto  Group dropped the most in 16 months as the
world’s second-biggest mining company forecast a decline in iron
ore prices because of new supplies.  Weir (WEIR)  Group Plc slid the most
in 10 months after Berenberg Bank downgraded the shares.  J
Sainsbury Plc (SBRY)  rose to a two-year high after posting sales growth
that was stronger than estimated.  The FTSE 100 fell 16.60 points, or 0.3 percent, to 6,441.32
at the close in London. The FTSE 100 has still gained 9.2
percent so far this year as U.S. lawmakers agreed on a
compromise budget. The broader FTSE All-Share Index dropped 0.3
percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index climbed 0.9 percent.  “The situation in Cyprus remains fluid and uncertain,”
said Guy Foster, head of portfolio strategy at Brewin Dolphin
Ltd. in  London . There is “a confusion about what form the tax
will take,” he added.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies on the
FTSE 100 was 2.6 percent higher than the average of the last 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Cypriot parliament in Nicosia began a debate on a
rescue package that forces bank depositors to share the cost of
the latest euro-zone bailout.  Deposit Levy  Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades on March 16 agreed to
demands by the currency bloc’s finance ministers to raise 5.8
billion euros ($7.5 billion) by imposing a charge on every bank
account in Cyprus. A vote has been postponed twice over the last
two days amid opposition in Cyprus to the proposal.  Anastasiades said today in an interview on  Sweden ’s TV4
channel the country’s parliament may reject the deal.  In the U.S., housing starts increased to a 917,000 annual
rate in February from a revised 910,000 the previous month,
according to a Commerce Department release. Economists in a
Bloomberg survey had predicted a 915,000 pace. Building permits,
a proxy for future construction, advanced 4.6 percent to
946,000, the strongest since June 2008.  Rio Tinto slid 5.2 percent to 3,107 pence, the biggest drop
since November 2011. Greg Lilleyman, president of Rio Tinto’s
operations in  Australia ’s Pilbara mining region, said he expects
“downward pressure” on iron-ore prices in the second half of
the year.  Separately, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. lowered its iron-ore
price forecast for the next three years. The brokerage
downgraded the shares of Rio Tinto and  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  BHP,
the biggest mining company, fell 3.5 percent to 1,981.5 pence.  A  gauge of mining companies  in the FTSE 350 Index declined
the most in almost nine months.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  lost 6.3 percent
to 473.9 pence.  Weir, Sainsbury  Weir retreated 4.4 percent to 2,325 pence, the biggest drop
since May, after Berenberg lowered its recommendation on the
shares to hold from buy.  There isn’t a “significant upside” to Weir’s share price,
given its performance so far this year, Berenberg analysts
Alexander Virgo and Benjamin Glaeser wrote in a note.  Sainsbury advanced 1.7 percent to 371.4 pence, the highest
price since March 2011. The U.K.’s third-largest supermarket
chain said same-store sales climbed 3.6 percent in the 10 weeks
ended March 16. The revenue, which excluded fuel sales, beat the
2 percent median estimate of analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  added 1.4 percent to 187.6 pence, its
highest price in seven months. Jefferies Group LLC increased its
share-price estimate to 174 pence from 155 pence. A merger
between Vodafone and Verizon Communications Inc. is a possible
outcome of talks between the two, analysts led by Jerry Dellis
wrote in a note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
