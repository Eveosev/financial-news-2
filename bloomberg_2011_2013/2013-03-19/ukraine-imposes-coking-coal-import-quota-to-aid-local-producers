Ukraine imposed a quota on imports
of coking coal, the variety of the commodity used in
steelmaking, in an effort to support local producers, Energy
Minister Eduard Stavytskyi said.  Inbound shipments climbed to 13.5 million metric tons in
2012 from 11.5 million tons in the prior year and 8 million tons
in 2009, he told reporters yesterday.  The government approved the limit on March 13, Kommersant-
Ukraine reported, citing Serhiy Prytomanov, head of the national
federation of steelmakers. The quota was fixed at 10.2 million
tons for this year and will increase costs for producing steel,
the newspaper cited him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
