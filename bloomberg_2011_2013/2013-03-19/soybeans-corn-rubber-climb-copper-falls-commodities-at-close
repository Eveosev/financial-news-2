parliament defeated a measure imposing taxes on  bank deposits ,
bolstering concern that  Europe ’s debt crisis will deepen. WTI’s
discount to Brent crude traded in  London  narrowed to less than
$15 a barrel.  Futures dropped 1.7 percent, trimming the spread with Brent
oil, after Cypriot President Nicos Anastasiades failed to gain
