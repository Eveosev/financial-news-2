Japanese shares gained, with the
 Topix Index (TPX)  rebounding from the biggest drop in 10 months on
speculation yesterday’s decline was excessive. Exporters and
shippers climbed after the yen weakened.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s biggest carmaker, rose 1.9
percent.  Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. (9107) ,  Japan ’s third-largest
shipping company by market value, rose 3.2 percent, paring
yesterday’s 4.8 percent drop.  Daiei Inc. (8263)  tumbled 5.7 percent
after surging 34 percent yesterday on a report retailer Aeon Co.
may buy a stake in the department-store operator.  The Topix gained 1.7 percent to 1,045.89 at the close in
 Tokyo  after yesterday dropping the most since May as a plan to
tax Cyprus deposit holders to fund a bailout sparked concern of
bank runs in the euro zone. The  Nikkei 225  Stock Average rose 2
percent to 12,468.23. Volume was 36 percent below the 30-day
average as Haruhi Kuroda prepares to replace Bank of Japan
Governor Masaaki Shirakawa tomorrow.  “There was general panic in response to the Cypriot deal
yesterday but now, after some reassessment, markets are
realizing it’s a special case and so the risk of contagion is
low,” said Nader Naeimi, Sydney-based head of dynamic  asset
allocation  at AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages $126
billion and is overweight on Japan equities. “While the BOJ
leadership change has been priced into stocks in the short-term,
there’s much better to come if the push to end deflation gathers
momentum.”  Topix Rally  The Topix rallied 45 percent from Nov. 14, when elections
were announced that brought Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to power
on a platform of increased stimulus and monetary easing from the
central bank. The gauge is trading at 1.2 times book value,
compared with 2.2 times for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and
1.6 for the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  Futures on the  S&P 500  climbed 0.1 percent today. The
measure lost 0.6 percent yesterday after Europe’s finance
ministers told Cyprus to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion)
from  bank deposits  to unlock emergency rescue loans. CNBC
reported today the nation’s parliament won’t approve the levy.  A change of leadership at the  Bank of Japan (8301)  takes effect
tomorrow amid expectations for further policy easing. Incoming
Governor Haruhiko Kuroda has pledged to do whatever is needed to
end 15 years of deflation, and expressed confidence a 2 percent
inflation target is achievable.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. boosted its 12-month target for
the Topix to 1,250, the investment bank last raised its outlook
for the index to 1,100 in January.  Yen Weakens  The yen declined versus all 16 major peers today, falling
to 95.75 against the dollar from as strong as 93.57 yesterday.  Toyota rose 1.9 percent to 4,940 yen, the biggest boost to
the Topix. Honda Motor Co., which gets most of its revenue
outside of Japan, gained 2.4 percent to 3,780 yen. Sony Corp.,
the nation’s No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, jumped 6.8
percent, reversing all of yesterday’s decline.  Shipping companies  led the advance on the Topix today,
gaining the most among the gauge’s 33 industry groups and
reversing yesterday’s decline.  Kawasaki Kisen increased 3.2 percent.  Nippon Yusen (9101)  K.K.,
Japan’s biggest shipping line, jumped 4.3 percent after dropping
4.2 percent yesterday. Daiichi Chuo K.K., which delivers crude
oil to Japan, surged 19 percent to lead gains in the sector.  Shipping Rates  Charter rates for the largest  oil tankers  on the benchmark
Saudi Arabia-to-Japan voyage rose 1.4 percent to 34.81 industry-
standard Worldscale points, data from the London-based Baltic
Exchange showed yesterday. The  Baltic Dry Index (BDIY) ,  a measure of
commodity shipping costs, gained for 14 straight days through
yesterday to reach its highest this year.  Taiyo Yuden Co. surged 8.2 percent to 1,236 yen, its
highest since March 2011 and the biggest gain today on the
Nikkei 225. CLSA Asia Pacific Markets boosted its rating on the
component-maker’s shares, following upgrades from Mizuho
Financial Group Inc. and Jefferies Group LLC this month after
the company forecast a return to profit.  Among shares that fell, Daiei slumped 5.7 percent after it
rose by its daily trading limit yesterday, surging the most
since 2003. Aeon is considering buying about 10 billion yen, or
29 percent, of the department-store operator, the Yomiuri
newspaper said yesterday. Daiei denied the report.  The  Nikkei Stock Average Volatility Index (VNKY)  fell 7.4 percent
to 24.19 today, indicating traders expect a swing of about 6.9
percent on the benchmark gauge over the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
