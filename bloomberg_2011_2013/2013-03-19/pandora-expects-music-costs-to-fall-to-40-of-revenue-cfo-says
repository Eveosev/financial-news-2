Pandora Media Inc. (P) , grappling with
rising music costs, expects the royalties it pays to artists and
record labels to decline to 40 percent of revenue from about 60
percent now, Chief Financial Officer Mike Herring said.  The company, the biggest Internet radio provider, expects
to reach that  target  over the next few years, Herring said today
at an investor conference sponsored by  Roth Capital Partners  in
Dana Point, California.  The company is tackling royalty rates and seeking to boost
the revenue it gets from advertising. With targeted ads and
interactive features, Pandora is able to levy a premium over
radio spots, Herring said. The company is working to close the
gap between its ad revenue, now at about 1 percent of the radio
industry’s total, and its 8.5 percent listener share, he said.  “It’s a long road,” Herring said.  Pandora, based in Oakland, California,  fell  0.7 percent to
$13.72 at the close in  New York . The stock has climbed 49
percent this year.  On March 7, the company reported better-than-expected
fourth-quarter results and said Chief Executive Officer  Joe Kennedy  would be leaving.  Music costs amounted to 61 percent of the company’s $125.1
million in revenue during the quarter ended Jan. 31, the company
said. That compares with 59 percent a year earlier.  Pandora is gearing up for “a long debate” on setting
royalties for 2016 and beyond, Herring said. A two-year
arbitration process to set new rates begins in January.  To contact the reporter on this story:
