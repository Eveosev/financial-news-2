Morgan Stanley (MS) , owner of the
world’s largest brokerage, is closing its Princeton, New Jersey,
office and will move the location’s 95 employees elsewhere,
according to a person briefed on the matter.  Morgan Stanley filed a  notice  with the New Jersey labor
department this month alerting it of the decision. The New York-
based bank is offering the staff, most of whom work in
technology and data, roles in other locations, said the person, 
who asked not to be named because the moves haven’t been 
publicly announced.  Chief Executive Officer James Gorman, 54, has pledged to
cut $1.6 billion in costs over the next two years as he seeks to
double return on equity even without an improvement in markets.
The firm last year expanded its space in lower Manhattan’s 1  New
York  Plaza to consolidate operations that were previously spread
over  Brooklyn , Manhattan and Jersey City, New Jersey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
