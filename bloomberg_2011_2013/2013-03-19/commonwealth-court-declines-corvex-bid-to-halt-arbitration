CommonWealth REIT said a state
court in  Maryland  denied a bid by investors Corvex Management LP
and Related Cos. to halt the arbitration of a governance dispute
with the real-estate company.  Corvex and Related “failed to provide sufficient facts”
to justify a halt to arbitration, according to a copy of an
order by Judge Audrey J.S. Carrion in Baltimore that was  filed 
by CommonWealth today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission.  Keith Meister’s Corvex and Related, led by Chief Executive
Officer Jeff Blau, are trying to oust CommonWealth’s board and
have said they were prepared to buy the Newton, Massachusetts-
based company, which they claim is undervalued because of a
“misalignment of incentives” between the REIT and its external
management.  The investors sued in state court in Maryland last week to
void amendments to CommonWealth’s bylaws that make it harder for
investors to replace board members, after failing to stop an
equity offering in federal court in  Boston  this month.  Lawyers for the plaintiffs told Carrion yesterday that they
didn’t want to be forced into arbitration, a process that she
may yet rule inappropriate. The Corvex and Related suit includes
a request to invalidate arbitration provisions of the
CommonWealth bylaws. Carrion hasn’t yet ruled on those.  Joanna Rose , a spokeswoman for the investors, said today in
an e-mailed statement that they are “confident” the court will
find the arbitration bylaws unenforceable.  ‘Self-Interested Conduct’  Related and Meister accused CommonWealth in their complaint
of breaching its fiduciary duty by “self-interested conduct
that has sacrificed and continues to sacrifice CommonWealth
shareholder value” for the benefit of the company’s trustees
and external manager, Reit Management & Research LLC.  CommonWealth’s five-member board of trustees includes
President Adam Portnoy and his father, Barry Portnoy, a company
founder. They also own Reit Management & Research.  The Maryland complaint accuses the Portnoys and other
trustees of making deals that favor the REIT’s management
company at the expense of shareholders.  Corvex faced a deadline March 18 to appoint an arbitrator
to represent its interests, Adam Offenhartz, an attorney for the
plaintiffs, said at a hearing yesterday.  Three Arbitrators  That arbitrator and one appointed by CommonWealth would
have 15 days to pick a third person for a tribunal that would
consider issues raised by Corvex and Related in its suit,
according to Offenhartz.  CommonWealth’s offering of 34.5 million shares was
completed March 5. Corvex and Related filed documents with the
SEC on March 13 asking shareholders to consent to the removal of
 CommonWealth REIT (CWH) ’s board.  Corvex and Related own a  stake  of about 8.6 percent of
CommonWealth, according to a March 13 regulatory filing. The
companies owned 9.8 percent of the outstanding shares prior to
the equity offering.  The case is Corvex v. CommonWealth REIT, 24C13001111,
Circuit Court of Maryland, Baltimore City.  To contact the reporter on this story:
