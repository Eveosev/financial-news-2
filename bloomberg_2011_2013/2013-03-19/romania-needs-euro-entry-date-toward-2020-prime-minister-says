Romania , the European Union’s
second-poorest member, needs to target euro adoption “toward”
2020, Prime Minister Victor Ponta said.  Joining the currency area in 2015 is “out of the
question” as the country doesn’t yet meet the criteria, Ponta
said in an interview broadcast today by the Bucharest-based
 Adevarul newspaper  on its website. Romania will decide on a new
euro-adoption target date in the first half of this year,
central bank Governor Mugur Isarescu said Feb. 7.  “We must be very careful,” Ponta said. “Beyond meeting
the convergence criteria, we have to see what’s the average
income, what’s citizens’ purchasing power and what are the
prices. Otherwise it would be a disaster as euro members are
already weakened.”  Europe ’s sovereign-debt crisis prompted former communist EU
members including  Poland ,  Hungary  and the Czech Republic to
postpone plans to join the currency union as they work toward
meeting requirements on the budget, inflation, public debt and
interest rates.  Romania narrowed its budget deficit to within the EU limit
of 3 percent of gross domestic product last year and may exit
the trading bloc’s excessive-deficit procedure, Minister
Delegate for Budget Liviu Voinea said on March 14. The country
has the fourth-lowest public debt in the 27-nation EU at 38
percent of GDP. Its inflation rate declined to 5.7 percent in
February.  The leu weakened 0.1 percent to 4.4131 per euro at 4:54
