Chile ’s government will carry out a
record cloud-seeding program in 2013 to alleviate a fourth year
of drought that’s hurting the country’s fruit and wine
industries.  Chile is planning to start cloud seeding in the
Metropolitan and Maule regions after a similar program in the
O’Higgins and Valparaiso regions helped reduce a shortage in
rainfall by 10 percent, Agriculture Minister Luis Mayol said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The government pumped 72 billion pesos ($152 million) last
year into its irrigation  program  that includes building
artificial dams and cloud seeding, Mayol said. Countries from
 China  to the  Philippines  have widened their use of cloud
seeding, where planes release silver iodide or carbon dioxide
into cumulus clouds to provoke rain.  Chile relies on rain and ice-melt from the Andes for its
fruit and wine industry located in the country’s central region.
The South American country is the world’s largest exporter of
table grapes and is ranked second in kiwis and avocados,
according to Chile’s Fruit Chamber, known as Fedefruta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
