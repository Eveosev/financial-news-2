  Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L) , Lithuania’s
state-controlled energy terminal operator, hired Latvian
construction company AS BMGS to engineer and build port
infrastructure for a new natural-gas terminal on the Baltic Sea.  BMGS agreed to complete the work by Oct. 1, 2014 for a
maximum price of 27.2 million euros ($35.2 million) plus value-
added tax, Klaipedos Nafta said in a  statement  on the Nasdaq OMX
Vilnius exchange. The contract was signed yesterday.  Involvement of a company from Latvia boosts chances that
the Baltic neighbor, which has vied with Lithuania and  Estonia 
to host a regional gas terminal, will collaborate in the
Lithuanian project, Rokas Masiulis, chief executive officer of
the Klaipeda-based terminal operator, said earlier this month.  Lithuania is building the floating liquefied natural-gas
terminal to diversify its gas imports and reduce reliance on
 Russia ’s OAO Gazprom. The outcome of a separate tender to build
a 20-kilometer (21.8-mile) pipeline linking the terminal to
Lithuania’s gas grid is  under review  by a court in Klaipeda.  Klaipedos Nafta last year agreed with Oslo-based Hoegh LNG
to lease a terminal that Hoegh is now building for delivery in
late 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
