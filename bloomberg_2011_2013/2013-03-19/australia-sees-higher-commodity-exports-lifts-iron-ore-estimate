Australia , the worldâ€™s biggest
shipper of iron ore, expects to earn more from the export of
minerals and energy resources next fiscal year after raising its
price forecast for the steelmaking raw material.  The value of exports may total A$205 billion ($213 billion)
in the year ending June 30, 2014, the Canberra-based  Bureau of
Resources  and Energy Economics said in a report today. Export
earnings may be A$186 billion in the year ending June 30, it
said. The bureau expects iron ore prices to average $119 a ton
in 2013, compared with a December estimate of $106 a ton.  Iron ore has dropped 7.3 percent in 2013 as industrial
output in  China , the largest buyer, had the weakest start to a
year since 2009 and concern rose that curbs on construction in
the country will reduce demand for the steelmaking material.
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its estimate for iron ore yesterday
on expectations demand will moderate and steel production will
slow in China, joining analysts from Morgan Stanley to Deutsche
Bank AG to Credit Suisse Group AG in forecasting lower prices.  Iron ore with 62 percent content delivered to the Chinese
port of Tianjin slipped 0.2 percent to $134.40 a dry ton
yesterday, according to the Steel Index Ltd. Swaps were trading
at $132 a ton for April, $127.50 for the second quarter and
$121.25 for the third, according to SSY Futures Ltd., a broker.  To contact the reporter for this story:
