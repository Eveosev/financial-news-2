Philippine bonds rose, with the 25-
year yield dropping to the lowest in at least a decade, amid
speculation the central bank will add to this year’s two
reductions in the rate paid on special deposit accounts.  The monetary authority will probably reduce the rate by
another 50 basis points,  Trinh Nguyen , a Hong Kong-based
economist at HSBC Holdings Plc, said at a briefing in  Manila 
today. The rate was last lowered on March 14 to 2.5 percent from
3 percent to deter speculation in the peso, which has
strengthened 6.8 percent in the past year. Only South Korea’s
won gained more among Asia’s 11 most-traded currencies.  “The Philippine central bank is not expected to give too
much for idle funds as it wants to deter speculation,”  Vishnu Varathan , an economist at Mizuho Corporate Bank Ltd., said in
 Singapore . “This will induce a substitution effect where some
of the funds from the special deposit accounts will go into
bonds.”  The yield on the 6.125 percent 25-year bonds dropped eight
basis points, or 0.08 percentage point, to 3.99 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services. That is the lowest
level for a benchmark 25-year note since Bloomberg started
compiling the data in November 2000.  The nation sold 25 billion pesos ($614 million) of 2033
notes to yield 3.52 percent, the lowest on record, Philippines
Deputy Treasurer Eduardo Mendiola said today.  The peso appreciated 0.1 percent to close at 40.690 per
dollar in Manila, Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed. One-month
implied volatility in the peso, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell six basis points to
3.67 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
