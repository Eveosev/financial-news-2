Bharti Airtel Ltd. (BHARTI) ,  India ’s biggest
wireless company, plunged the most in seven months after a court
ordered billionaire Chairman  Sunil Mittal  to appear in court in
a case regarding the purchase of airwaves.  Shares fell 4.6 percent to 293.40 rupees in Mumbai, the
most since Aug. 9. Bharti has been charged with purchasing
second generation spectrum in excess of the government’s 4.4
megahertz limit, said Judge O. P. Saini at the court in New
Delhi, where the company is based.  “We will fight this charge sheet,” Bharti said in an e-
mailed statement. The mobile-phone carrier said the charge was
“an attempt to tarnish” its reputation.  If the charges against Bharti are proven, the government
may take away the excess airwaves, according to Harit Shah,
analyst at Mumbai-based Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities. In a
separate case, the company, which has seen its  debt  increase
more than sixfold since 2010, has also been asked to pay a fine
of 3.5 billion rupees ($64 million) for violating its third-
generation phone services license agreement. Bharti has
challenged the order in court.  “This will be a disaster, not just for Bharti, but for the
industry and the country,” said Shah, who recommends investors
 sell  the stock. “Bharti has a lot of expenses coming their way
and being stripped of this excess spectrum and stuck with a fine
won’t help their case.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
