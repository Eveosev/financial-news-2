Carnival Corp. (CCL)  canceled 10 more
sailings of its Carnival Triumph cruise ship as it makes repairs
on the vessel that suffered a crippling engine fire off the
coast of  Mexico  in February.  Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator, is making
“significant” investments in the ship’s fire prevention and
detection systems as well as its ability to offer hotel services
while running on backup power, the company said today in an e-
mailed statement. The Triumph’s 3,100-passengers were left with
limited food and non-flushing toilets after the fire knocked out
power to the ship, which had to be towed to shore.  The Triumph will return to service on June 3. Two voyages
on the Carnival Sunshine, another ship now in dry dock, were
also canceled, the Miami-based company said. Guests on the
affected voyages will receive a full refund and a 25 percent
discount on a future cruise.  The company’s staff has been working “virtually around the
clock” to update the vessels, Gerry Cahill, president and chief
executive officer of Carnival Cruise Line, said in the
statement. The company will apply lessons learned from the
Triumph incident to all of its ships, he said.  Three other Carnival vessels experienced problems last
week, and the company cut its annual earnings forecast amid
price discounting.  Carnival fell 2.1 percent to $33.21 at the close of  New
York  trading. The stock has declined 9.7 percent this year,
compared with an 8.6 percent gain for the Standard & Poor’s 500
Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
