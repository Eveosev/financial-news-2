Wigan’s Callum McManaman won’t face
punishment from  England ’s Football Association for a high tackle
that injured Newcastle’s Massadio Haidara in a soccer match last
weekend.  McManaman won’t be charged for the challenge because a
match official saw the incident in the March 17 game, the F.A.
said today in a  statement  on its website. Haidara was forced to
leave the match after McManaman’s foot missed the ball and hit
him near the knee.  “In the case of McManaman, it has been confirmed that at
least one of the match officials saw the coming together, though
not the full extent of the challenge,” the F.A. said. “In
these circumstances retrospective action cannot be taken.”  The F.A. rules allow players to be punished retrospectively
for incidents that haven’t been seen by on-field officials.  Newcastle managing director Derek Llambias said the club
was disappointed by the F.A. decision.  “It is clear from this decision that the current
disciplinary procedures are not fit for purpose,” Llambias said
in a statement on the team’s website. “Newcastle United, along
with other clubs, have had players suspended for incidents
reviewed after the game. Whilst not trivialising these
incidents, they were not, in our opinion, of the seriousness of
Callum McManaman’s tackle on Haidara.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
