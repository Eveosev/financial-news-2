Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) ’s Galaxy
S4, a bigger and faster smartphone unveiled last week, costs
$244 to make, according to data from market researcher IHS
iSuppli.  A larger and more-advanced display, faster chip and more
computer memory drove the cost of building the entry-level 16 GB
Galaxy S4 15 percent higher than its predecessor, Galaxy S3, the
El Segundo, California researcher said in a statement today.  The handset, which has a 5-inch screen and 13-megapixel
camera, is among three high-end smartphones Samsung is releasing
this year after being overtaken in the U.S. by  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s
iPhone 5 in the fourth quarter. The materials and manufacturing
cost of the iPhone 5 is $207, iSuppli said in September, just
after it debuted.  “Although its hardware is not radically different from the
Galaxy S3 introduced in April of 2012, the Samsung Galaxy S4
includes some critical component updates that enhance its
functionality,” Vincent Leung, senior analyst for cost
benchmarking at IHS iSuppli, wrote in the statement.  The estimates are based on a “virtual teardown” and may
be amended after a physical examination of the device and its
components, the researcher said. The new model will be available
in the U.S. beginning April 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
