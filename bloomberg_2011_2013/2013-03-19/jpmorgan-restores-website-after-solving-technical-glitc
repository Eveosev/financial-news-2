JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , the largest
U.S. bank, has restored its consumer website after a technical
glitch yesterday left some customers unable to access their
balances and full transaction histories.  “We have a technology problem regarding customers’ balance
information that we’ve resolved,” the bank today said in an e-
mailed statement.  The cause was an internal technical issue unrelated to
cyberattacks that left Chase.com customers unable to access
their accounts for several hours on March 12, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
