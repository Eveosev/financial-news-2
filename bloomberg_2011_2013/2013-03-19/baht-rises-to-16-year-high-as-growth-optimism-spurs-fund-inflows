Thailand ’s baht rose to its
strongest level since July 1997 amid optimism the nation’s
improving economy will draw more funds from abroad.  The currency gained the most in two months as the MSCI Asia
Pacific Index of shares rebounded from its biggest loss since
July. Appreciation was being spurred by a Fitch Ratings upgrade
of the nation’s debt rating this month and because of upward
revisions of economic forecasts, Bank of Thailand Governor
Prasarn Trairatvorakul said March 13, adding that the monetary
authority was not concerned about the strengthening.  “The central bank seems to be tolerant of the gains, which
also makes it easier for investors to put money into Thailand,”
 Yuji Kameoka , chief currency strategist at Daiwa Securities Co.,
said in  Tokyo . “The nation’s economic performance is relatively
strong, even among Asian nations, and that tends to attract fund
inflows.”  The baht climbed 0.5 percent to 29.39 per dollar as of 9:08
a.m. in Bangkok and earlier touched a high of 29.38, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. This comes as global funds  bought 
$2.1 billion more  government bonds  than they sold this month
through yesterday, adding to net purchases of $2.7 billion in
February and $3.7 billion in January, Thai Bond Market
Association data show.  Fitch raised its rating on Thailand by one level to BBB+ on
March 8, three levels above junk, citing a resilient economy and
a more stable political environment.  The central bank raised its 2013 growth forecast in January
to 4.9 percent from an October estimate of 4.6 percent. Deputy
Governor Pongpen Ruengvirayudh said this month that the bank’s
prediction will “most likely” be revised upwards to more than
5 percent.  Gross domestic product  expanded 6.4 percent last
year.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, dropped 11 basis
points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 4.79 percent.  Government bonds held steady, with the 10-year yield near
this month’s low. The yield on Thailand’s 3.625 percent notes
due June 2023 was little changed at this month’s low of 3.59
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
