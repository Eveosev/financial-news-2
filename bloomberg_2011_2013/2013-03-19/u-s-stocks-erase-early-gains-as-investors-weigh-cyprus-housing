U.S. stocks erased early gains as
investors weighed growth in new-home construction with concern
about a plan to impose a levy on bank deposits in Cyprus to help
fund the nation’s bailout.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was little changed at
1,552.48 at 10:32 a.m. in  New York  after climbing as much as 0.3
percent earlier.  Banks in Cyprus and stock exchange will remain closed at
least until March 21 amid speculation lawmakers may postpone the
vote on the bank levy that’s planned for later today. The 5.8
billion-euro ($7.5 billion) raid on bank accounts, intended to
cut the cost of a rescue package to 10 billion euros, sparked
outrage when Cypriots woke March 16 after marathon talks in
Brussels to find bank transfers blocked.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
