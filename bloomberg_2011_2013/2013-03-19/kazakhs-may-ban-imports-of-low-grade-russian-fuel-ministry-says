Kazakhstan  may order a ban on
shipments of Russian gasoline as the world’s biggest energy
exporter sends lower-quality fuel to its southern neighbor, the
central Asian country’s Oil and Gas Ministry said.  Kazakhstan, a member of the customs union with  Russia  and
Belarus, will compensate the fuel imports with a comparable
supply of crude oil to Russia, allowing it to collect an export
duty after it’s resold elsewhere,  said  Kuandyk Kulmurzin, head
of the ministry’s oil industry department, according to an
interview posted on the Kazakh prime minister’s website today.  “We need to minimize Russian fuel imports to decrease oil
supplies to the country,” he said.  Russia has banned the Euro-2 gasoline grade starting on
Jan. 1, resulting in the export of low-quality fuel to central
Asian countries, including Kazakhstan, hurting its refineries,
Kulmurzin said.  Kazakhstan also plans to send as much as 1.5 million tons
of crude oil to PetroChina’s Dushanzi refinery in Xinjiang,
 China , under a so-called tolling arrangement, Kulmurzin said. In
a tolling arrangement, a company provides the feedstock and
collects the finished product, paying a fee for processing.  -- Editors: Paul Abelsky,  Jeffrey Donovan   To contact the reporter on this story:
