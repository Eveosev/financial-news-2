The proposed bank-account levy in
Cyprus won’t be imposed in other euro-area countries, Dutch
Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said.  “It won’t happen in other countries because their banking
industries aren’t as unbalanced as in Cyprus,” Dijsselbloem
told Dutch lawmakers in The Hague today, referring to the size
of the financial sector compared with gross domestic product.  Euro-area finance ministers last week agreed to a tax on
Cypriot bank deposits as officials unveiled a 10 billion-euro
($13 billion) rescue for the country’s government and banks. The
levy is intended to raise 5.8 billion euros.  “In Cyprus, the government isn’t even able to control it’s
own deposit insurance plan,” Dijsselbloem said, adding that
bank shareholders and junior bondholders will “lose
everything” under the bailout.  To contact the reporter on this story:
