Cap SA (CAP) ,  Chile ’s largest iron-ore
producer, rose the most in six weeks after the stock yesterday
fell to a three-month low.  Cap advanced 1.3 percent to 15,662 pesos at 1:19 p.m. in
Santiago after earlier advancing 2.3 percent, the biggest
intraday gain since Feb. 1. The stock was the second-most
actively traded on the Santiago exchange today, with  volume  more
than twice the average of the last three months.  The shares had fallen for six straight days, a cumulative
plunge of 8.1 percent, as analysts including Morgan Stanley and
Deutsche Bank AG cut their ore-price forecasts. In China, iron
ore prices have slumped 15 percent after reaching their 2013
high on Feb. 20, according to data compiled by The Steel Index
Ltd.  “The punishment to Cap’s shares may have been a bit
excessive,” Felipe Ruiz, an analyst at BCI, said in a phone
interview today from Santiago.  Iron-ore sales accounted for 50 percent of Cap’s revenue in
2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. BCI has a neutral
 recommendation  and a target price of 18,050 pesos per Cap share
by year end, Ruiz said. That is 17 percent above yesterday’s
close.  To contact the reporter on this story:
