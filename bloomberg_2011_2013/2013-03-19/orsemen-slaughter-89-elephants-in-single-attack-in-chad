A group of about 50 horsemen
speaking Arabic killed at least 89 elephants in an attack in
 Chad  last week in the worst poaching incident in the region
since February last year, the World Wildlife Fund said.  The slaughtered elephants included 33 pregnant females and
15 calves, the WWF says in an e-mailed statement today, citing
Chadian government officials, who confirmed the details of the
attack.  “In all likelihood, this is the same group of Sudanese
poachers who killed 300 elephants in northern Cameroon in
February, 2012,” Bas Huijbregts, Head of the Central  Africa 
branch of the WWF’s campaign against wildlife trade, said in the
statement.  Elephants throughout Africa are under threat from poachers
who harvest the animals’ ivory for sale to buyers in countries
including China and  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
