The  New York Giants  received one
extra pick in the 2013 National Football League draft as
compensation for last year’s free-agent losses and will now have
the next-to-last of the 254 draft selections.  The NFL yesterday awarded 32 compensatory picks to 16
teams, with the  Baltimore Ravens  and  Atlanta Falcons  each
getting the maximum four, and the  Tennessee Titans  and  San
Francisco  49ers both getting three. The highest compensatory
pick went to the Houston Texans, who got an extra third-round
selection, the 95th overall in April’s draft.  NFL rules state that teams losing “more or better”
players in free agency than they acquire in the previous year
are eligible to receive compensatory draft picks. The
compensatory picks supplement the 222 regular selections over
the seven rounds of the draft, to be held April 25-27 in New
York.  The value of compensatory free agents is determined by a
formula based on salary, playing time and postseason honors that
was developed by the NFL Management Council. Not all free agents
lost or signed by a club are covered by the formula.  The Giants last year lost free agents  Mario Manningham ,
Aaron Ross and Dave Tollefson while signing Martellus Bennett,
Sean Locklear and Shaun Rogers. Under the NFL’s formula, the
compensatory free agents they lost were ranked slightly higher
than the ones they signed. As a result, they got the 253rd
overall pick, one spot ahead of the  Indianapolis Colts , who will
have the final selection in the draft.  To contact the reporter on this story:
