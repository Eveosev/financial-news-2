Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc 
director Joseph Machale will step down, becoming the final board
member appointed under former Chief Executive Officer  Fred Goodwin  to depart, according to person briefed on the move.  Machale, a non-executive director, has served on the board
for about nine years, said the person, who declined to be
identified because the move hasn’t been announced publicly. The
lender hasn’t decided if he will be replaced, the person added.  RBS received a 45.5 billion-pound ($69 billion) government
bailout in 2008 and 2009, the biggest bank rescue in the world,
following its purchase of Amsterdam-based ABN Amro Holding NV’s
investment banking and Asian assets three months before the
credit crisis started.  The government replaced Goodwin as CEO with Stephen Hester
and removed Chairman Tom McKillop and appointed  Philip Hampton 
in his place. In Feburary 2009, seven non-executive directors
stepped down as the government overhauled the board.  Sky News  reported the move earlier today. Officials at the
Edinburgh-based lender declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
