Russia plans to grant visa-free
entry to citizens of all countries who come to the country for
business, sports or cultural events for less than 10 days, RIA
Novosti reported, citing Culture Minister Vladimir Medinsky.  The government is currently reviewing a bill that would
extend its current program to all countries, rather than just
the 26 it deems “safe,” the state-run news service cited
Medinsky as saying today.  The countries already with visa-free access include  Brazil ,
Turkey, Argentina, Bosnia,  Serbia , Colombia, Israel and
Thailand, according to the Foreign Ministry’s website. Russia
already allows citizens of all countries to stay as long as 48
hours without a visa if they arrive by cruise ship.  To contact the reporter on this story:
