Euro-area  construction output  fell
the most in four months in January as slumping activity in
 France  and  Spain  offset a gain in Germany.  Construction in the 17-nation euro area decreased 1.4
percent from December, when it rose 0.3 percent, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. The December
figure had earlier been estimated as a 1.7 percent drop. From a
year earlier, January  construction  fell 7.3 percent.  France, the euro area’s second-largest economy, showed a 4
percent drop in construction in the latest month, while Spain
reported a 3.1 percent decrease, according to today’s report. In
Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, construction rebounded 3
percent in January after a 1.1 percent drop in the prior month.
January output in the Netherlands decreased 2.8 percent.  In the 27-nation EU, construction dropped 1.3 percent from
December, when it declined 0.6 percent, according to today’s
report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
