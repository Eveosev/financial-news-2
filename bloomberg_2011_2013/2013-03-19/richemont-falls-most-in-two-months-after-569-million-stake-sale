Cie. Financiere Richemont SA (CFR) , the
owner of the Cartier brand, fell the most in almost two months
in Zurich trading after a shareholder sold about 7 million
shares for 539 million Swiss francs ($569 million).  The  shares  declined as much as 3.6 percent, the biggest
intraday decline since Jan. 21. The stake was sold at 77 Swiss
francs a share, according to two people familiar with the
transaction. The stock traded 3.5 percent lower at 76.75 francs
at 10:46 a.m local time.  “It’s the reason the share came down,” Rene Weber, an
analyst at Bank Vontobel, said by phone from Zurich. Uncertainty
over the identity of the seller could also be weighing on the
stock, he said.  Richemont shares have  quadrupled  in the past four years and
touched a record in January as earnings growth was fueled by
Chinese customers buying more jewelry and watches. While the
stock is up 32 percent in the past year, analysts expect profit
in the 12 months through March 2014 to rise 12 percent, less
than half the pace they forecast for this fiscal year.  Alan Grieve, a spokesman for Geneva-based Richemont, said
the company hasn’t been informed of any “significant
transfers” of shares.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which is managing the placement,
had originally set a price range of 76.30 francs to 77.50 francs
a share, according to the terms obtained by Bloomberg News.  Seven  investors  have reported stakes of more than 7 million
shares, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Waddell & Reed
Financial Inc. (WDR)  cut its holdings by 5.8 million shares to 7.2
million shares, according to year-end 2012 filings.  Chairman Johann Rupert owns 522 million Class B shares,
giving him 50 percent of the company’s voting rights, according
to the company’s 2012 annual report. The Class A shares are
traded, while Class B aren’t listed, according to Grieve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
