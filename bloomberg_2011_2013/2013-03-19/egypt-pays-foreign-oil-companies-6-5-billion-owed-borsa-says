Egypt ’s government paid foreign
energy companies $6.5 billion in overdue payments owed this
year, Al Borsa reported, citing Oil Minister Osama Kamal.  The North African country still owes international oil
companies at least $200 million, Kamal said, according to the
Cairo-based financial newspaper. The report didn’t identify any
of the companies involved, nor did it quantify any amounts owed
from previous years. The newspaper also didn’t specify whether
Kamal was referring to the government’s fiscal year, which runs
from July 1 to June 30, or the calendar year.  Kamal said Egypt paid the equivalent of $1 billion of the
total amount in Egyptian pounds because of its shortage of
foreign currency, Al Borsa reported.  El-Watan newspaper reported on Feb. 19 that Egypt owed
foreign oil companies about $9 billion, citing Industry and
Trade Minister Hatem Saleh. Egypt’s foreign currency reserves
have tumbled more than 60 percent from December 2010 to about
$13.5 billion.  Hamdi Abdel Aziz, a spokesman for the Oil Ministry, and
Mahmoud Nazim, an undersecretary at the ministry, couldn’t be
reached on their mobile telephones for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
