Bank of America Corp. (BAC) ’s head of
Australian equities in Sydney, Matthew Unsworth, has left the
second-largest U.S. lender and won’t be replaced, according to a
person familiar with the matter.  Australian-based staff in equities trading, sales and risk
will now report to  Hong Kong , according to the person, who asked
not to be identified because the information is private.
Unsworth didn’t immediately respond to a voice-mail message left
on his mobile phone seeking comment.  Trading volume  on the Australian stock market fell 6.9
percent last year after a 54 percent reduction in the previous
12 months. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank ranked
eighth for Australian and New Zealand equity and rights
offerings last year, down two places from 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Chief Executive Officer  Brian T. Moynihan 
has sold more than $60 billion in assets to boost capital and
targeted $8 billion in  annual expense  savings by 2015 at the
firm. The lender, which also operates under the name Bank of
America Merrill Lynch, reduced its staff by 14,601 employees
last year to about 267,000.  Shares in the bank rose 109 percent last year in  New York 
trading.  The Wall Street Journal reported Unsworth’s departure
earlier today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
