Outgoing  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor
Masaaki Shirakawa today concluded what he called an “extreme
time” in office with a warning for his successor that
increasing the supply of money alone won’t end deflation.  “There is no link between the monetary base and growth in
consumer prices,” Shirakawa said in his final press conference
in Tokyo. “Monetary policy of course has a role, but it’s
necessary for a wide range of institutions to make efforts to
boost competitiveness and growth potential.”  Incoming Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said last week he wants
to look at additional stimulus “soon,” and academic Kikuo Iwata, taking one of the two deputy positions, has pushed for
expanding the supply of money in the economy.  Shirakawa said weakness in the yen -- which has fallen more
than 16 percent against the dollar since mid-November in
anticipation of greater monetary stimulus -- doesn’t mean the
economy has strengthened. He signaled that any attempt to remove
the BOJ’s independence may damage trust in the currency.  The former University of Chicago student came under
escalating political pressure during his tenure to halt declines
in consumer prices.  When asked by a reporter if he would like to come back in
another life as a central bank governor, Shirakawa said he “is
not thinking that way.” A bird-watching fan, the outgoing
governor said he looked forward to enjoying his hobbies.  “I will be absolutely free from tomorrow,” he said. “If
I were to describe my time in a few words, I would say it was an
extreme five years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
