Brazil ’s swap rates fell for a
fourth straight day as a report showing slower-than-forecast
inflation spurred speculation the central bank may refrain from
raising borrowing costs this year.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 dropped two
basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 8.55 percent at 10:53
a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real appreciated 0.1 percent to 1.9809
per U.S. dollar.  Today’s below-forecast inflation reports and concern about
the global economy “should influence the yield curve,” Octavio de Barros, the chief economist at Banco Bradesco SA, wrote in a
research note.  Producer, construction and consumer prices, as measured by
the IGP-M index, rose 0.24 percent from Feb. 21 through March
10, the Getulio Vargas Foundation reported today. The figure was
less than the 0.25 percent median forecast of 15 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Minutes of the central bank’s March 5-6 meeting, published
last week, indicated that an increase in the 7.25 percent target
lending  rate  wasn’t imminent as policy makers said that “a
cautious management of monetary policy” was needed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
