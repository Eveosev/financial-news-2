run at the end of the first quarter and built a 15-point lead at
53-38 with four minutes left before halftime.  The Heat scored the first eight points of the third period
to take a brief lead, only to have the Celtics respond and take
a four-point lead after three quarters,  Boston opened the final period with a 14-5 run to rebuild a
13-point lead. Miami responded with an 18-4 run to regain the
lead. With the score tied 103-103, James hit a long jumper with
10.5 seconds remaining for the decisive points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
