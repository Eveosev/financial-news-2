Juerg Buergin, a former executive
director of operations at  UBS AG (UBSN)  in Singapore, was deceived by
an underaged prostitute and her pimp into believing she was 18,
according to his lawyer.  The girl, now 20, wasn’t a victim and should testify
publicly, Buergin’s lawyer Selva Naidu told a Singapore
subordinate court today on the first day of the Swiss national’s
trial. Judge Eddy Tham agreed with prosecutors that she give
evidence privately.  Buergin, 41, is the first of 51 men charged by police for
having paid sex with the girl to stand trial. At least 18 men,
including a member of the Shaw family that built an Asian movie
production and real estate empire, have been sentenced to jail
after admitting to paying for sex with a minor.  Buergin, married with two children, allegedly committed the
offenses at the Shangri-La Hotel in September 2010 and the
Mandarin Oriental Hotel in January 2011. The maximum penalty for
paid sex in  Singapore  with someone under 18 is a seven-year jail
term and an unspecified fine.  The criminal case is Public Prosecutor v Buergin Juerg.
