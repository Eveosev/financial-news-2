Daihatsu Motor Co. (7262) , the minicar-
making unit of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , named Masanori Mitsui as its
next president, making him the company’s first non-Toyota chief
in more than two decades.  Mitsui, 62, currently an executive vice president, will
replace Koichi Ina on June 27, Daihatsu said in a statement
today. The last time the  Osaka , Japan-based automaker wasn’t
headed by an ex-Toyota official was in 1992, according to Makoto
Zenno, a Daihatsu spokesman.  While relinquishing the presidency, the parent company will
take control of Daihatsu’s board, with 7 out of 11 board members
coming from Toyota, according to Zenno. Toyota spokeswoman Shino Yamada said the automaker isn’t in a position to comment on the
appointments because Daihatsu is a separate company.  Daihatsu fell 1.4 percent to 1,931 yen at the close in
Tokyo trading. The benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average advanced 2
percent.  Ina will succeed Katsuhiko Okumura as chairman, with
Okumura becoming an adviser, according to Daihatsu.  To contact the reporter on this story:
