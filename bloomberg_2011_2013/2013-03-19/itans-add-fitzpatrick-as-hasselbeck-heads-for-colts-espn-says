Former Buffalo Bills starting
quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick agreed to a two-year contract with
the  Tennessee  Titans,  ESPN reported , citing an unidentified
person familiar with the situation.  Fitzpatrick, a 30-year-old Harvard University graduate, was
released last week after starting all but four games for the
Bills over the past three seasons and throwing 71 touchdown
passes and 54 interceptions. Heâ€™ll compete for playing time in
Tennessee with Jake Locker, the eighth overall pick in the 2011
National Football League draft, ESPN said.  The Titans yesterday released veteran backup quarterback
Matt Hasselbeck, who plans to sign with the Indianapolis Colts
as a backup to starter Andrew Luck, according to ESPN.  The New York Jets signed free-agent linebacker Antwan Barnes, who had a career-high 11 sacks for the San Diego
Chargers during the 2011 season. Barnes, a fourth-round pick of
the Baltimore Ravens in 2007, had three sacks last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
