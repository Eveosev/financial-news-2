Egyptian authorities arrested a
cousin of the late Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi in Cairo after
a standoff in which he fired on security forces, police said.  Ahmed Qaddaf al-Dam barricaded himself inside his home in
the upscale Zamalek district in the Egyptian capital as
authorities came to execute an arrest order issued by Interpol,
Cairo police Major Ahmed Fawzi said by phone. Libyan officials
also tried to get Qaddaf al-Dam to surrender, Fawzi said.  The arrest comes as Libyan authorities were criticized in
 Egypt  for the detention of dozens of Coptic Christians detained
for allegedly trying to spread Christianity in the north African
nation. Protesters massed outside the Libyan embassy in Cairo
last week following the death in custody of one of the
Christians in Libya, prompting the mission to temporarily
suspend work.  Qaddaf al-Dam is wanted for his alleged links to Qaddafi,
who was ousted and killed following the 2011 uprising that has
left the oil-rich north African nation mired in a cycle of
violence and political disarray. Also taken into custody was
former Libyan ambassador to Egypt Ali Nariya, Fawzi said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
