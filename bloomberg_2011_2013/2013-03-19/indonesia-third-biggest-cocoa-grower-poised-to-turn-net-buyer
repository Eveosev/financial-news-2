Cocoa imports by  Indonesia  may more
than double next year, transforming the third-largest grower
into a net buyer, as companies process more beans for chocolate,
said the Indonesian Cocoa Association. Futures climbed for the
first time in five days.  Purchases will probably rise to 100,000 metric tons from
40,000 tons this year, said Chairman Zulhefi Sikumbang. Grinding
capacity will gain to 550,000 tons in 2014 from below 500,000
tons now as the harvest stays at 450,000 tons, he said in an
interview. Exports will drop 26 percent this year to 100,000
tons, the lowest in more than a decade, the group said Jan. 23.  Declining supplies from Indonesia may curb the 6.6 percent
drop in bean prices in New York this year. Global demand is set
to outstrip supply through 2014-2015 as pests, disease and aging
plantations curb production, says the International Cocoa
Organization. The market may have a shortage of 58,000 tons this
season through September, says Rabobank International.  “This development will be price supportive in so far as it
leads to a global shortage of beans to traditional importers in
 Europe  and North America; but also as emerging demand from
Southeast Asia grows,” said  Abah Ofon , a Singapore-based
analyst at Standard Chartered Plc. “I think it will
fundamentally change the shape of the industry.”  Cocoa for May delivery climbed as much as 1.5 percent to
$2,119 a ton on ICE Futures U.S., the biggest intraday jump in a
week, before trading at $2,096 at 9:41 a.m. in London.  African Beans  Investors are building new plants and improving facilities,
Sikumbang said at an ICCO meeting in Bali, Indonesia yesterday.
Capacity expanded after the government taxed bean exports in
2010. Rates range from zero if the average price in New York is
below $2,000 a ton to 15 percent if it’s above $3,500. The duty
is 5 percent this month.  Producing nations from Ivory Coast to Indonesia will
process about 50 percent of all beans within three years as they
seek to extract more value, the ICCO estimated last year.
Grinders in Indonesia imported about 30,000 tons of beans from
West Africa last year, and purchases are expected from Papua New
Guinea this year and next, Sikumbang said.  Exports from Indonesia have fallen. They dropped to 136,000
tons in 2012 from 439,305 tons three years earlier, association
data show. The  harvest  starting April will probably be little
changed at 475,000 tons, according to the median of five
industry estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Production may not
increase because trees are aging, said Sikumbang.  Rubber, Palm   “Half of them are more than 20 years old and farmers are
shifting to more profitable crops such as oil palm and rubber,”
he said. Indonesia has about 1.5 million hectares (3.7 million
acres) of plantations, the association says.  The government is trying to boost output by grafting,
dispensing new seeds and helping farmers care for their trees.  “Everybody has already sort of positioned themselves to
realize that Indonesia isn’t going to be a major supplier of
beans on the market anymore,” said Keith Flury, a commodity
analyst at Rabobank in  London . “Western African bean exports
are even more important globally because now much of the bean
availability is concentrated there.”  Ivory Coast is the world’s biggest producer, followed by
Ghana and Indonesia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
