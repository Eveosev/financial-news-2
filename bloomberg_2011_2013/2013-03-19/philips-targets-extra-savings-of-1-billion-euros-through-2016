Royal Philips Electronics (PHIA)  NV said
it sees opportunities for additional cost savings of 1 billion
euros ($1.29 billion) between 2014 and 2016 by simplifying the
process of making products.  The “end-to-end” approach to product-creation
restructures the purchasing value chain and reduces costs of
procurement and research and development by working with one
integrated team, Chief Financial Officer Ron Wirahadiraksa said
today in a presentation in  Boston  for analysts and investors.  “This is a promising and exciting area” and the measures
could improve margins, Chief Executive Officer Frans van Houten
said.  The additional savings target follows a companywide
overhaul initiated in October 2011 that is designed to save 1.1
billion euros by 2014 and includes 6,700 job cuts. This previous
program involves reducing management layers and improving IT
systems to speed decision-making.  Philips shares rose 3.3 percent to 23.77 euros at 4:14 p.m.
in Amsterdam trading.  The restructuring efforts are bearing fruit for Amsterdam-
based Philips, which competes with  Siemens AG (SIE)  and  General
Electric (GE)  Co. in health-care equipment and lighting. In January,
Philips reported a rise in fourth-quarter earnings before
interest, taxes, amortization and one-time items of 50 percent
to 875 million euros, beating analysts’ average estimate of 866
million euros, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Sales gained 6.7 percent to 7.16 billion euros. Health-care
revenue rose 7.1 percent, while lighting sales advanced 9.2
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
