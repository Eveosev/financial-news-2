The U.S. two-year interest-rate
swap spread, a measure of debt market stress, surged to the
highest level in six months as European policy makers struggle
to forge a bailout plan for Cyprus.  The gauge, which widens when investors seek the perceived
safety of  government securities  and narrows when they favor
assets such as company debentures, increased 2.9 basis points to
17.97 basis points as of 3:43 p.m. in New York. That’s the
highest level on an intra-day basis since Sept. 4.  Cyprus’s parliament today rejected an unprecedented levy on
 bank deposits  after a deal hammered out by euro-area finance
chiefs sought to raise 5.8 billion euros ($7.5 billion) by
drawing funds from accounts in the country in return for 10
billion euros in international aid.  “You’ve got the beginnings of an indicator of bank
stress,”  Jim Vogel , an interest-rate strategist at FTN
Financial in Memphis, Tennessee, said in a telephone interview.
Investors may “back away from risk commitments” given the
uncertain outcome of Cyprus’s potential bank-deposit levy, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
