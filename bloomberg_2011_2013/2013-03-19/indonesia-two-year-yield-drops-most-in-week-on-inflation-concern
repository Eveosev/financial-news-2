Indonesia ’s two-year bonds rallied,
with their yield dropping the most in a week, on speculation
investors prefer shorter-dated notes to guard against inflation.  Consumer prices  will probably gain 5.13 percent this year,
compared with 4.28 percent last year, according to the median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 20 analysts. Prices rose at
the fastest pace since June 2011 in February. Cooling investment
growth and continuing burden of energy subsidies are among
emerging sources of pressure on the nation’s economic outlook,
with fuel-subsidy reform as one of the appropriate policy
responses, World Bank said in a statement yesterday.  “Investors are probably shifting from long-term notes to
the shorter ones on expectations of faster inflation,” said
Dian Ayu Yustina, a fixed-income analyst at PT Bank Danamon
Indonesia in Jakarta. “This uncertainty regarding the fuel-
subsidy adjustment is adding to the concern.”  The yield on the government’s 11 percent bonds maturing in
October 2014 dropped three basis points, or 0.03 percentage
point, to 4.31 percent as of 3:03 p.m. in Jakarta, the most
since March 11, prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association
show. The yield on securities due May 2023 was little changed.
The gap between the yield on the two- and 10-year notes widened
to 115 basis points, the most since June.  Indonesia has no plans to increase subsidized-fuel costs in
April, Julian Aldrin Pasha, spokesman to President Susilo
Bambang Yudhoyono, said in Jakarta today. Finance Minister  Agus
Martowardojo  said March 14 the government may impose limits on
sales, and increasing prices will be the last option.  The rupiah was steady at 9,713 per dollar, prices from
local banks show. It traded at a 0.3 percent premium to the one-
month non-deliverable forwards, which advanced 0.1 percent to
9,741, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  A daily  fixing  used to settle the derivatives was set at
9,705 per dollar by the Association of Banks in  Singapore ,
compared with 9,718 yesterday.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, rose 18 basis points
to 6.03 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
