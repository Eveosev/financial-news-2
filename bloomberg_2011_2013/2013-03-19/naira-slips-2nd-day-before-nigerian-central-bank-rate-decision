Nigeria ’s naira weakened a second
day against the dollar as reduced demand for the West African
nation’s bonds put pressure on the currency before a central
bank meeting where the key rate will probably be maintained.  The currency of  Africa ’s biggest oil producer fell as much
as 0.1 percent and traded at 158.71 per dollar by 11:15 a.m. in
Lagos, the commercial capital, bringing its depreciation this
year to 1.6 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Since reaching a record low on Feb. 20, the yield on the 2022
bond has increased 120 basis points to 11.62 percent, according
to yesterday’s prices compiled by Bloomberg.  “With a continued selloff in local bonds in recent weeks,
arising in part from reduced foreign interest in the local  bond
market , the naira may experience more volatility than usual in
the short term,” Ridle Markus and  Dumisani Ngwenya , analysts at
 Absa Capital  in Johannesburg, wrote in an e-mailed note today.
The trend “is unlikely to be sustained amid the improved
inflation backdrop.”  The Central Bank of Nigeria’s Monetary Policy Committee
today will announce its decision on the benchmark  interest rate ,
which was held at a record 12 percent for eight consecutive
meetings. Ten out of 11 economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect
the rate to be maintained, while one predicted a 50 basis-point
cut.  “Should the CBN keep rates on hold today, as we expect, we
believe expectations for a rate cut in the second half will
increase, while the naira may benefit from the continued tight
monetary policy stance,” Markus and Ngwenya said.  Inflation Target  Inflation accelerated to 9.5 percent in February from 9
percent a month earlier, the statistics agency said on March 17.
Central bank Governor Lamido Sanusi said on Jan. 25 it will be
“very difficult” to keep the rate in the regulator’s target of
less than 10 percent for the rest of the year.  The central bank sold $300 million to lenders yesterday,
higher than the $180 million sold a week ago and the most at a
 single sale  since Dec. 19, it said in an e-mailed statement. The
Abuja-based regulator uses the twice-a-week auctions to
stabilize the naira as the cost of importing refined fuel, which
accounts for 70 percent of the local gasoline market, boosts
dollar demand and puts pressure on the currency. The bank cut
total sales by 6 percent last week to $360 million.  Yields on Nigeria’s $500 million of Eurobonds due January
2021 climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to
4.341 percent.  Ghana ’s cedi weakened for a sixth day, slipping less than
0.1 percent to 1.9355 per dollar in Accra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
