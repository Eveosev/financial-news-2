Chile’s peso weakened for a fifth
straight day in the longest stretch of losses this month as
concern turmoil in Cyprus may deepen  Europe ’s financial crisis
led to strength in the U.S. currency as a refuge.  The peso declined 0.1 percent to 472.45 per  U.S. dollar  at
12:02 p.m. in Santiago. The currency has  weakened  from a one-
month high of 470.89 reached March 12 while staying in a range
of 470 to 475 per dollar this month.  “The dollar’s rising very slightly,” said Ronald Volpi,
the head of spot currency trading at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA. “We’re still stuck in this range.”  A plan to cut the cost of a rescue package for Cyprus’s
economy by raiding bank accounts sparked outrage, leading to
speculation the country’s lawmakers may strike the measure down.
The fight over the bailout risks triggering more turmoil in the
euro area financial crisis that started in 2009.  Volatility in the peso extended its decline. Ninety-day
volatility, a gauge of the magnitude of the currency’s average
daily fluctuations over the past three months, dropped to the
lowest since 2006. The peso has bounced between 469 and 476 per
dollar since Jan. 3.  “I have never seen a market in the same range for so
long,” said Alejandro Araya of Banco Santander  Chile  in
Santiago, who has traded the currency for 20 years. “It can’t
continue.”  The peso reached the strongest level in two decades against
a group of 20 major trading partners in February, according to
central bank data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
