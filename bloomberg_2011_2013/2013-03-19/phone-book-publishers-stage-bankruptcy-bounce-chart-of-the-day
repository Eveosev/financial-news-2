Bankruptcy filings by two of the
largest U.S. telephone-directory publishers led to an atypical
performance for their shares: they rose.  Dex One Corp. (DEXO)  and  SuperMedia Inc. (SPMD)  submitted Chapter 11
petitions yesterday in order to carry out a merger, which the
companies approved in August. They sought court protection three
years after emerging from earlier reorganizations.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows how far their shares have
plunged since Dex One, based in Cary,  North Carolina , started
trading on Feb. 1, 2010. SuperMedia, based in Dallas, made its
market debut about four weeks earlier.  Dex One, formerly R.H. Donnelley Corp., peaked during its
first month of trading and then plummeted as much as 99 percent.
SuperMedia, which Verizon Communications Inc. spun off as Idearc
Inc. in 2006, set its high in April 2010 and later lost as much
as 98 percent.  Revenue at both companies has fallen since the second
quarter of 2011 as consumers increasingly shun printed phone
directories and use online listings. Dex One’s fourth-quarter
results, released yesterday, showed a seventh straight quarter-
to-quarter decline in sales. SuperMedia is due to release last
quarter’s results on March 21.  Dex One and SuperMedia each rose 11 percent in the wake of
their bankruptcy filings yesterday. The companies expect to
conclude their deal and emerge from court protection within 60
days, they said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
