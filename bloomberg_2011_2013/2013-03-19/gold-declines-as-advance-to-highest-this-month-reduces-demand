Gold climbed to the highest in
three weeks as concern that Europe’s debt crisis may intensify
boosted the appeal of the precious metal as a haven. Palladium
slumped the most in more than four months.  Lawmakers in Cyprus today voted to shoot down an
unprecedented levy on  bank deposits , a key demand of European
officials in return for funds to prevent a financial collapse.
The  Federal Reserve  begins a two-day policy meeting today. Gold
climbed to a record $1,923.70 an ounce in September 2011 amid
Europe’s fiscal woes and as the U.S. central bank expanded its
balance sheet in a bid to revive growth.  “Cyprus has become a big issue, and investors are worried
about the repercussions,”  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior market
strategist at Archer Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in
a telephone interview. “People want to know when the Fed plans
to end the easing.”  Gold futures for April delivery rose 0.4 percent to settle
at $1,611.30 at 1:36 p.m. on the Comex in New York, after
touching $1,615, the highest for a most-active contract since
Feb. 26.  Prices have slumped 3.8 percent this year as signs of
recovery in the U.S. spurred speculation that the Fed will cut
stimulus measures. Minutes of the previous Fed meeting released
on Feb. 20 showed some policy makers said the central bank
should be ready to vary the pace of its monthly $85 billion in
bond purchases, while Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  defended the
program during congressional testimony last month.  Holdings in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest  exchange-
traded-fund  backed by the metal, fell to 1,219.5 metric tons
yesterday, the lowest since July 2011.  Global Turmoil  Global economic turmoil may last “at least two more
years,” and liquidity injections by industrialized countries
have only bought time, not solved problems,  Kaushik Basu , the
chief economist at the  World Bank , said today in Washington.
While Cyprus accounts for less than half a percent of the euro
economy, the fight over the bank tax risks triggering new tumult
in the financial crisis that began in 2009 in Greece.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , palladium futures for
June delivery slumped 3.9 percent to $735.20 an ounce, the
biggest drop since Oct. 23. Platinum futures for April delivery
fell 1.5 percent to $1,555.40 an ounce, after touching
$1,549.80, the lowest since Jan. 4.  Silver futures for May delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$28.843 an ounce on the Comex.  In the  spot market , an ounce of platinum bought as little
as  0.961 ounce  of gold, the least since Jan. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
