Canadian  wholesale sales  rose in
January led by computers, government figures showed.  Wholesale sales rose 0.3 percent to C$49 billion ($47.9
billion), Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa, in line with
the median estimate for a 0.4 percent gain in a Bloomberg  survey 
with 18 responses.  Wholesale sales have stalled after reaching a record C$50
billion in May. Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney  softened his
language about raising the central bank’s  policy interest rate 
this month because of “material excess capacity” in the
economy, as the  inflation rate  hovers at a three-year low.  Computer and communications equipment sales rose 8 percent
to C$3.52 billion in January. The biggest gain since April 2008
was led by the introduction of new products at the end of last
year, Statistics Canada said.  Four of seven major categories tracked by the agency rose
in January, representing two-thirds of sales, Statistics Canada
said. Motor vehicle and parts sales fell 2.8 percent to C$8.07
billion.  The volume of wholesale sales, which removes the impact of
price changes, rose 0.5 percent.  Statistics Canada  today also revised its estimate of
December’s wholesale sales decline to 1.1 percent from 0.9
percent reported earlier.  Inventories increased 1.2 percent to C$61.5 billion in
January.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
