German 10-year government bonds
climbed for a fourth day as Cypriot lawmakers began to debate a
proposed levy on  bank deposits , amid concern they will reject
the measure that’s needed to unlock an international bailout.  Benchmark 10-year bund yields dropped to an 11-week low
after Cyprus’s President Nicos Anastasiades said the nation’s
parliament is likely to vote against the plan, prompting
investors to seek the safety of  Europe ’s highest-rated fixed-
income assets. The country’s finance minister submitted his
resignation, Market News reported. Greek and Cypriot bonds
tumbled, and Spanish securities also fell as investors sold the
debt of so-called peripheral nations.  “The Cypriot parliament is meeting to attempt to vote on
the package but it seems from what is coming out of Cyprus that
it’s not likely to get through,” said Owen Callan, an analyst
at  Danske Bank A/S (DANSKE)  in Dublin. “We are in a risk-off mode and
bunds are going higher. There are suggestions that the finance
minister has tendered his resignation but it hasn’t been
accepted. No one is really sure what the route out of this is at
this juncture.”  German 10-year bund yields fell six basis points, or 0.06
percentage point, to 1.35 percent at 5 p.m. London time, after
reaching 1.34 percent, the lowest since Jan. 2. The 1.5 percent
security due February 2023 rose 0.565, or 5.65 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,286) face amount, to 101.415.  The two-year note yield slid two basis points to 0.002
percent after dropping to minus 0.006 percent, also the lowest
since Jan. 2.  Emergency Loans  Defense Minister Fotis Fotiou told Greek Skai TV the
Cypriot government is working on different scenarios to raise
the 5.8 billion euros set as a condition for a bailout,
including a backup plan if the vote isn’t passed.  The debate was televised on state-run RIK TV, which
reported that a vote on the bill will immediately follow at
around 8 p.m. local time.  Finance chiefs from the euro region told Cyprus yesterday
that it must raise money from bank depositors to unlock
emergency loans, while suggesting it could spare small-scale
savers. The island nation’s banks and stock exchange will remain
closed at least until March 21.  The “feeling I’m having is that the house is going to
reject it because they feel and think it isn’t just and that
it’s against the interest of Cyprus, at large,” Anastasiades
told  Sweden ’s TV4 channel in an interview today when asked about
the proposed bank tax.  Cyprus Bonds  Cyprus’s  government bonds  slumped, pushing the yield on the
4.625 percent security due February 2020 up 211 basis points to
12.34 percent. That’s the highest since Jan. 17, based on
closing-market data compiled by Bloomberg. The bid price for the
securities was 65.563, while the offer price was 68.985.  The yield on Cypriot notes due in November 2015 surged 567
basis points to 19.07 percent.  Greek bonds fell for a seventh day, the longest streak
since Nov. 2, pushing the 10-year yield up as much as 85 basis
points to 12.12 percent, the  highest level  since Dec. 20.  Bunds outperformed all their euro-area peers amid
speculation the Cypriot bailout model may be applied to other
euro-area nations requesting aid.  Spanish Yields  “Decisions like this, much like the decision to haircut
Greek debt in October 2011, actually benefits some countries,”
said former Cypriot central bank governor Athanasios Orphanides
in an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Surveillance” with
 Tom Keene . “A decision like this reduces the financing costs
for the German government so the German government can now
borrow at negative rates as a result, while it inflicts pain on
other countries.”  Spain’s 10-year yields rose eight basis points to 5.04
percent. The securities have fallen for five days, the longest
run since July. The yield reached 5.08 percent yesterday, the
most since March 5.  The rate on  similar-maturity  Italian bonds climbed nine
basis points to 4.73 percent.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today, followed by those of Finland and  Germany ,
according to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between
two- and 10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  The Netherlands sold 6.52 billion euros of new 10-year
bonds at an average yield of 1.83 percent. Greece and  Spain 
auctioned bills.  Germany plans to sell an additional 4 billion euros of
benchmark 10-year bunds tomorrow. Europe’s largest economy last
sold 10-year debt at an average yield of 1.66 percent on Feb.
20. That compares with a record-low auction yield of 1.31
percent set on July 11.  Portugal  is scheduled to sell bills.  Germany’s bonds handed investors a return of 0.3 percent
this month through yesterday, according to indexes compiled by
Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies. Italian bonds gained 0.6 percent, while Spanish
securities returned 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
