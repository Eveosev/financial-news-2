Belgian  consumer confidence  fell to
a three-month low in March as concerns about unemployment
reached the highest level in more than three years amid a
worsening economic outlook.  The consumer sentiment indicator for Belgium, the euro
area’s sixth-largest economy, declined to minus 24 this month
from minus 17 in February, the Brussels-based  National Bank of
Belgium  said today in an e-mailed statement. That’s the lowest
reading since December.  “The fall in  consumer confidence  is almost exclusively due
to the significantly worse macroeconomic outlook,” the central
bank said in the statement. “Thus, expectations as regards the
economic situation have become very gloomy again. Moreover,
pessimism about unemployment has risen to its highest level for
three years,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
