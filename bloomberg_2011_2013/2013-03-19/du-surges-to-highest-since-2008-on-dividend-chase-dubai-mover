Du rallied to the highest level in
more than four years as investors seek to take advantage of the
United Arab Emirates phone operator’s bigger dividend payout.  Shares of the company formally known as  Emirates Integrated
Telecommunications Co. (DU)  rose 3 percent to 4.85 dirhams, the
strongest intraday level since October 2008, at 12:27 p.m. in
Dubai. The stock was the  second-most traded  by value on the
benchmark  DFM General Index (DFMGI) , which gained 0.9 percent.  Du is set to pay a 2012 cash dividend of 30 fils a share,
double its payout a year earlier, to shareholders of record by
March 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. U.A.E. phone
companies are benefiting from a recovery in Dubai, whose economy
probably expanded 5 percent in 2012, the fastest pace since
2007, according to government estimates. Du’s fourth-quarter net
income more than doubled, beating estimates.  “Investors are chasing phone companies that have a strong
track record in issuing sustainable dividends,” said Nabil Farhat, partner at Abu Dhabi-based Al Fajer Securities.  Du’s stock has rallied 39 percent this year after its
market share increased to about 49 percent. That’s more than
double the advance for the benchmark gauge in the same period,
while shares of Abu Dhabi-based competitor  Emirates
Telecommunications Corp. (ETISALAT)  added 14 percent.  Five  analysts  recommend investors buy Du shares, while five
have a hold rating on the stock and one says sell, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
