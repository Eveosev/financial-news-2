China Minsheng Banking Corp. (1988) ’s  Hong
Kong branch  plans to triple its assets over the next three years
as it branches out from trade finance to merger advisory
services and wealth management.  Total assets at the unit, which began operations a year
ago, will grow to more than HK$100 billion ($13 billion) in
three years, including off-balance-sheet items, Lin Zhihong, the
Beijing-based lender’s chief executive officer for Hong Kong,
said in an interview March 15. The figure stood at HK$33.2
billion at the end of last year.  Mainland China’s first privately owned lender joins larger
rivals in establishing a presence in Hong Kong as Chinese
companies step up international trade and seek acquisitions
overseas. With a team of bankers hired from Piper Jaffray Cos.
the bank will target the entrepreneurs starting to follow bigger
state-owned enterprises in buying assets abroad, Lin said.  “Trade financing is our bread and butter,” Lin said.
“Next we will focus on helping Chinese private businesses
expand outside China by mergers and acquisitions. Private
banking and asset management is our third step.”  Shares of Minsheng rose 1.4 percent to HK$10.26 as of 9:37
a.m. in Hong Kong trading, widening their gain this year to 14.3
percent. That compared with a decline of less than 0.1 percent
in the city’s benchmark Hang Seng Index today.  Small Businesses  Minsheng’s 2.59 trillion  yuan  ($417 billion) of assets
included 250.7 billion yuan of loans to  small and micro
enterprises  at the end of the first half of 2012, or 19 percent
of the bank’s total lending. Minsheng “will be selective” in
pursuing business from “blue-chip” companies, Lin said.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  (Asia) Ltd., the Hong
Kong unit of the world’s largest lender by market value, already
had more than four times Minsheng’s targeted assets at the end
of June, with HK$424.8 billion.  BOC Hong Kong Holdings Ltd. (2388) , the
largest Hong Kong unit of a mainland lender, had HK$1.68
trillion.  Minsheng’s investment banking unit in the city may receive
approval this year from the China Banking Regulatory Commission
and regulators in Hong Kong, Lin said. The division recruited a
team of 20 people from  Piper Jaffray  in Hong Kong, boosting the
total number of Hong Kong staff at Minsheng to about 120,
according to Lin, who plans to increase staff to 500 in the next
three years.  Chinese companies announced $82.6 billion of cross-border
acquisitions last year, compared with $90 billion in 2011, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The National Development and Reform
Commission, China’s economic planning agency, this month set a
target of 8 percent growth in trade for 2013. Exports advanced
7.9 percent in 2012 and imports rose 4.3 percent.  Private Banking  Minsheng’s private banking unit in Hong Kong may get the
needed licenses “soon,” and will target customers with assets
of HK$10 million or more, said Lin.  China, which has the second-highest number of high net
worth individuals in the Asia-Pacific region, saw its population
with investable assets of $1 million or more climb 5.2 percent
to 562,000 in 2011, RBC Wealth Management and Capgemini SA said
in a September report. China’s rich had $2.71 trillion of
investable wealth in 2011, accounting for 25 percent of the
region’s total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
