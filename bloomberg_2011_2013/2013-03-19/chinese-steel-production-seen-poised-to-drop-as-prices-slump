Steel production in China is poised
to decline after prices slumped for a fourth week, according to
Commodore Research & Consultancy.  Hot rolled coil fell 4 percent from the previous week, the
most since September,  Jeffrey Landsberg , managing director at
the New York-based researcher, said in an e-mailed report today.
Inventories of flat and construction steel products in China
gained 10 percent in the last week to approximately 21.6 million
metric tons, he said.  “We believe that Chinese steel mills are poised to
temporarily reduce production in order to stimulate steel
prices,” Landsberg said in the report. “It seems clear that
production is outpacing demand.”  The Asian nation is the world’s biggest importer of  iron
ore , a steelmaking raw material.  To contact the reporter on this story:
