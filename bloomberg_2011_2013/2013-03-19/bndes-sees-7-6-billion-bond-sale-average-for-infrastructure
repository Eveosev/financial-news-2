Brazil’s state  development bank 
projects that companies will sell an average of 15 billion reais
($7.6 billion) of bonds a year through 2016 to finance
infrastructure projects from highways to hydroelectric dams.  Government officials visited investors in New York and
London last month to drum up financing for $235 billion of
infrastructure contracts. Infrastructure projects have raised
$260 million in tax-exempt bonds since October, according to
regulatory filings.  “Here in Brazil, where infrastructure bottlenecks exist,
projects represent an attractive return on investments for
sponsors,” Nelson Siffert, executive director for
infrastructure at the development bank, known BNDES, said in an
interview at the bank’s office in  Rio de Janeiro .  Brazil will offer rates of return of more than 10 percent
for infrastructure projects ranging from building railroads to
operating airports, Finance Minister  Guido Mantega  told
investors in New York on Feb. 26.  To contact the reporters on this story:
