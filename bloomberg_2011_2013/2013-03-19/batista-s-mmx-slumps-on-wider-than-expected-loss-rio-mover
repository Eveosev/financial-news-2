MMX Mineracao & Metalicos SA (MMXM3) , the
iron-ore producer of Brazilian billionaire  Eike Batista , had it
biggest five-day decline since August after posting a quarterly
loss that was seven times bigger than analysts’ expectations.  MMX, based in  Rio de Janeiro ,  dropped  0.9 percent to 3.16
reais at the close in  Sao Paulo , extending its five-day drop to
16 percent, the most since Aug. 15 on a closing basis. The stock
traded at 1.3 times its three-month average volume.  MMX yesterday reported a fourth-quarter net loss of 348.7
million reais ($175.7 million), more than the 48.7 million reais
adjusted net loss estimated by analysts in a Bloomberg  survey ,
after writing down a canceled project in Chile.  The results are “negative” as they show a deterioration
in the company’s operating figures in relation to the previous
quarter, Banco Santander SA analysts Felipe Reis and Alex Sciacio said in a note to clients today.  “We have a negative read on MMX’s fourth-quarter
results,” the Sao Paulo-based analysts wrote. “We remain on
the sidelines with respect to the stock due to increased risk
perception associated with project execution and funding.”  MMX, which aims to invest about 2 billion reais this year,
expects to finish a review of its projects in 90 days, Chief
Executive Officer  Carlos Gonzalez  said in a conference call with
investors today, adding that 2013 will still be a “difficult”
year for the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
