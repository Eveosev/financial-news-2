Ukraine plans to extend an
agreement with traders to coordinate grain exports in the
marketing year which starts July 1, agriculture researcher
UkrAgroConsult said.  The  Agriculture Ministry  and grain exporters agreed to
monitor outbound shipments and the domestic grain balance for a
one-year period after a 29 percent decline in the wheat harvest
due to drought last year.  A new agreement with traders will give the Agriculture
Ministry “the reins to control the market,” the Kiev-based
researcher UkrAgroConsult said in e-mailed statement today.  The researcher estimates Ukraine’s 2013 grain harvest at 53
million tons or 15 percent more than last year.  The Agriculture Ministry said grain traders also want to
extend the agreement, according to a statement on the
government’s  website .  Volodymyr Klymenko, the head of the Ukrainian Grain
Association, wasn’t immediately avaliable to comment when
contacted by Bloomberg today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
