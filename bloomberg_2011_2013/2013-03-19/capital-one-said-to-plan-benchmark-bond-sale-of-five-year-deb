Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that gets more than half its revenue from credit cards,
sold $850 million of bonds in a two-part offering.  The lender’s $250 million of three-year, floating-rate
notes yield 45 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate and its $600 million of 1.5 percent,
five-year debt has a spread of 82 basis points more than
similar-maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The three-year portion was added after the deal was
marketed earlier today, according to a person familiar with the
transaction, who asked not to be identified citing lack of
authorization to speak publicly. The bonds may be rated A3 by
Moody’s Investors Service, the person said.  Capital One’s $1.3 billion of 6.75 percent notes due
September 2017 traded at 121.1 cents on the dollar to yield 1.83
percent on March 13, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Barclays Plc, Morgan Stanley and  Wells Fargo & Co . managed
the offering for the McLean, Virginia-based bank, Bloomberg data
show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
