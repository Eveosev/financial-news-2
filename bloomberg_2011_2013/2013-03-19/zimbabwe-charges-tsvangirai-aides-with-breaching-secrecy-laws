Zimbabwean prosecutors said four
officials from the Movement for Democratic Change party who work
in Prime Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai ’s office have been charged
with breaching state secrecy laws.  The four were arrested on March 17, a day after the nation
held a referendum on a new constitution. They also stand accused
of impersonating the police and possessing material for criminal
use. If convicted, they face a fine or a 20-year jail term.
Prosecutors have said the four should be denied bail.  “The offense the accused persons are facing are very
serious,” Michael Mugabe, the chief law officer in the
Attorney’s General office, said at a court hearing today in
Harare, the capital. “There is a very strong probability of
abscondment.”  Defense lawyer Alec Muchadehama told Magistrate
Marehwanazvo Gofa the case against his clients was weak and
their detention was unlawful.  Beatrice Mtetwa, a lawyer who was at the scene of the
arrests was also detained. She and the four others were remanded
into custody and will appear in court again tomorrow.  The MDC and President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe African
National Union-Patriotic Front have shared power since 2009
following a disputed election that international observers say
was marred by violence. New elections are due to be held later
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
