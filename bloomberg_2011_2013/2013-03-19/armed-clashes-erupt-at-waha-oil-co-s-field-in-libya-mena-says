Armed clashes took place at an oil
field owned by Libya’s Waha Oil Co. after unidentified gunmen
attacked security forces guarding the facility, Egypt’s state-
run Middle East News reported, citing company officials.  The unrest at the Dahra field occurred as protesters
gathered at the company’s Gialo site to demand jobs at the
facility, the Cairo-based agency, known as Mena, cited the
unidentified officials as saying.  The strike at Gialo resulted in a cut in the country’s
crude output by 120,000 barrels a day, Libya’s Oil Minister
Abdulbari Al-Arusi said yesterday. Waha Oil is owned by the
state-run National Oil Corp. in partnership with  ConocoPhillips (COP) ,
 Hess Corp. (HES)  and  Marathon Oil Corp. (MRO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
