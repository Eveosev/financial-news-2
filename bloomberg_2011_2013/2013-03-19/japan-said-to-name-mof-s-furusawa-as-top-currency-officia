Japan plans to name Finance
Ministry official Mitsuhiro Furusawa as the country’s top
currency bureaucrat, two government officials said.  Furusawa will replace Takehiko Nakao, who is Japan’s
nominee for the presidency of the  Asian Development Bank , as
vice finance minister for international affairs, said the
officials, who asked not to be named because the appointment
hasn’t been made public.  Furusawa, 57, will take up the post as trading partners
from South Korea to Germany have criticized Japan over the yen’s
fall of more than 16 percent against the dollar since mid-
November. Former ADB president  Haruhiko Kuroda , who takes over
as  Bank of Japan (8301)  governor tomorrow, has pledged to provide more
monetary stimulus, which may weaken the yen further.  The Nikkei newspaper reported Furusawa’s appointment on
March 16.  Furusawa, who heads the bureau in charge of bond issuance,
joined the ministry in 1979 after graduating from the University
of Tokyo with a bachelor’s degree in law. He worked at the
 International Monetary Fund  from 2010 and 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
