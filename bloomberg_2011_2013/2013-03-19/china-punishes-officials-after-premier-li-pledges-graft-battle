China   punished  regional officials
for extravagant spending and using government money on personal
meals, the government said, two days after Premier Li Keqiang
said stamping out corruption was a top priority.  The Communist Party’s Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection said the finance bureau chief in Qiongzhong County
was removed from party and administrative posts for spending
state money on meals with personal friends, the official Xinhua
News Agency reported today.  The party secretary of Baihe County got a disciplinary
warning for inappropriate use of a car, Xinhua reported. The
commission announced four other cases in which rules against
extravagance were violated, according to the Chinese-language
report.  The move came two days after China’s new premier promised
to crack down on corruption. The party has also announced an
anti-extravagance campaign, telling officials to avoid lavish
receptions and banquets.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
