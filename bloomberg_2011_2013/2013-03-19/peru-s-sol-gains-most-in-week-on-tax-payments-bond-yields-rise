Peru ’s sol advanced the most in a
week as companies exchanged dollars to pay taxes even as the
central bank intervened to slow the local currency’s gains.  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.5930 per U.S. dollar at the
close of trading, according to prices from Datatec. The central
bank said on its website it bought $20 million of U.S. currency
and paid an average 2.5951 soles per dollar, after purchasing a
similar amount yesterday at 2.5974.  Peruvian companies have until March 21 to make monthly tax
payments and until April 2 to meet their obligations for the
2012 tax year. The euro fell and U.S. Treasuries gained as
Cyprus’s parliament voted down an unprecedented bank-deposit
levy, fueling speculation the nation’s bailout will falter.  “There’s a seasonal increase in dollar sales, though on
this occasion the appreciation has probably been limited by the
external turbulence,” said  Hugo Perea , the chief economist at
 BBVA Banco Continental  in  Lima .  The yield on Peru’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol bond due
August 2020 climbed two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point,
to 3.80 percent at 2:39 p.m. in Lima, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.12 centimo to 125.72 centimos per
sol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
