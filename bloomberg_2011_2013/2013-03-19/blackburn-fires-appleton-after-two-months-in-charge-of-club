Blackburn Rovers , which were
relegated from English soccer’s Premier League last season,
fired coach Michael Appleton after 67 days in charge.  The  37-year-old  left Blackpool to join Rovers on January
11, and was dismissed today along with assistant manager Ashley
Westwood, first team coach Darren Moore and recruiter Luke
Dowling, the Championship side  said today  on its website.  Blackburn is in 18th place in the Championship, behind 
Blackpool although it’s played one fewer match. The team
last won Feb. 9, and since has lost four and drawn three.  Appleton replaced Henning Berg, who was fired Dec. 27 after
57 days as manager.  Steve Kean , who was coach for two seasons,
left in September.  Appleton, a former West Brom player, started the season at
Portsmouth, and then left for Blackpool, where he was coach for
65 days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
