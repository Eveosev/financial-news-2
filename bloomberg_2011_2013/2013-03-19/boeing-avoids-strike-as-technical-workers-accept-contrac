Boeing Co. (BA)  can expect to avoid
strikes through 2016 and benefit from lower pension costs after
technical workers agreed to a new contract that was unchanged
from one they rejected last month.  The vote was 4,244 to 654, according to the  Society of
Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace . The deal
provides for raises of as much as 5 percent a year over a four-
year contract. New workers will be switched to a 401(k)-style
 retirement plan  from a  pension plan .  The group of about 7,400 technical workers, mainly at
Boeing’s Seattle-area manufacturing and development hub, turned
down the same offer by 53 percent of the votes on Feb. 19,
authorizing their union to call a strike at any time. The
professional engineers, another group of workers represented by
the same union, accepted a similar offer that day, weakening the
technical workers’ position.  Boeing’s machinists, who had staged seven walkouts since
their union’s 1935 creation, agreed in December 2011 to extend
their contract through 2016 in a surprise deal struck nine
months before it was set to expire. The only major engineers’
strike was in 2000, when they stopped work for 40 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
