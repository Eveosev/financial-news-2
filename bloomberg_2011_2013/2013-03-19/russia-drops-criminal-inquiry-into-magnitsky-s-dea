Russia  ended its investigation into
Hermitage Capital Management tax and legal adviser Sergei Magnitsky’s death in prison, saying it found no sign he had
suffered physical abuse while he was detained.  Magnitsky was subject to no “special conditions” while in
prison, Russia’s Investigative Committee said on its  website 
today. He died of cardiac failure and there is no evidence of
torture or physical violence against him in prison, it said.  Magnitsky, who died in November 2009 at age 37, was in
pretrial detention after alleging the biggest-known  tax fraud  in
Russia, a theft of $230 million from the national treasury. The
case sparked a diplomatic row, with the U.S. imposing sanctions
on Russian officials accused of playing a role in Magnitsky’s
death and Moscow retaliating by barring American citizens from
adopting Russian orphans.  Russia is “officially defending Sergei Magnitsky’s
torturers and killers,” Hermitage Capital said today in an e-
mailed statement. Magnitsky and Hermitage head  William Browder 
are accused of evading taxes of 522 million rubles ($17
million), the Prosecutor General’s Office said Nov. 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
