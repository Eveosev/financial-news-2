Manulife Financial Corp. (MFC) ’s Canadian
bank withdrew a promotional mortgage rate, under pressure from
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty who is encouraging consumers to
reduce household debt.  “After consulting with the Department of Finance, Manulife
Bank has withdrawn the promotional campaign and reverted to our
previous posted rate,” the Toronto-based insurance company said
in an e-mailed statement today.  Manulife Bank withdrew its rate of 2.89 percent for a five-
year fixed mortgage, posted on March 15. Manulife had cut its
rate from 3.09 percent.  “We don’t want a race to the bottom on mortgage rates by
our financial institutions so I’m pleased at their response,”
Flaherty told reporters in Ottawa. “I had one of my staff call
and indicate my displeasure.”  Earlier this month, Flaherty told  Bank of Montreal 
officials that he didn’t like the lender’s reduction in its
five-year mortgage rate to 2.99 percent.  “I’m kind of shocked,” John Andrew, a real estate
professor at Queen’s University in Kingston, Ontario, said of
the government’s intervention. “It’s a very overt attempt to
manipulate what I see as the competitive free market.”  Manulife also looks “weak” for giving in to the
government pressure, he said. “Manulife looks like the kid who
just had his lunch money stolen.”  Graeme Harris, a spokesman at Manulife, didn’t immediately
return a call seeking comment.  Paul Deegan, a  Bank of Montreal (BMO) 
spokesman, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
