SmarTone Telecommunications
Holdings Ltd. (315) , the wireless carrier controlled by Hong Kong’s
biggest property company, said it’s the provisional winner for
radio spectrum to provide wireless broadband in the city.  SmarTone, controlled by  Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd., (16)  will
pay a utilization fee of HK$640 million ($82.5 million) and must
post a performance bond of HK$100 million for the spectrum,
which it will use for a 15-year term, the company said in a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange today.  The spectrum will allow SmarTone to expand data capacity
and improve peak data speed, the company said.  Four mobile
network  operators successfully bid for a total of 50 MHz of
radio spectrum for a total sum of spectrum utilization fees of
HK$1.54 billion, the city’s government said today in a separate
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
