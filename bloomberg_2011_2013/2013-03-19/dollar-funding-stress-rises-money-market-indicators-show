Money-market forward indicators
showed short-term dollar funding stress increased.  Three-month London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which
represents the rate at which banks say it would cost to borrow
from another,  rose  to 0.2821 percent from 0.2801 percent,
according to the British Bankers’ Association. The Libor-OIS
spread, a gauge of banks reluctance to lend, was little changed
at 14.1 basis points.  The difference between the two-year swap rate and the
comparable-maturity Treasury note yield, known as the swap
spread, widened 1.74 basis points to 16.88 basis points. The
gap, a gauge of investors’ perceptions of U.S. banking sector
credit risk as swap rates are derived from expectations for
dollar Libor, reached 17.25 basis points today, the highest
since Feb. 6.  Overnight index swaps, or OIS, give traders predictions on
where the Fed’s effective funds rate will average for the term
of the swap. The central bank’s target rate is set in a range of
zero to 0.25 percent.  Predictions in the forward market for Libor-OIS, known as
the FRA/OIS spread, rose 5.1 basis points to 21.3 basis points,
according to the second rolling three month contracts.  Swap rates serve as benchmarks for investors in many types
of debt, including mortgage-backed and auto-loan securities.  The seasonally adjusted amount of U.S.  commercial paper 
fell $2.6 billion to $1.018 trillion in the week ended March 13,
according to Federal Reserve data.  Euribor-OIS Spread  The cost for European banks to convert euro-denominated
payment streams into dollars-based funding via the cross
currency swaps market rose. The three-month cross-currency basis
swap was 19.9 basis points below Euribor, from 18.8 below
yesterday.  Foreign-exchange swaps are typically for periods of less
than a year, while cross-currency basis swaps usually range from
one to 30 years. The latter are agreements in which a person
borrows in one currency and simultaneously lends in a different
currency. The trade involves the exchange of two different
floating-rate payments, each denominated in a different currency
and based on a different index.  The Euribor-OIS spread, the difference between the euro
interbank offered rate and overnight indexed swaps, narrowed.
The measure of banks’ reluctance to lend to one another was 12.7
basis points.  Repo Rates  The overnight Treasury general collateral repurchase
agreement rate opened today at 0.18 percent, according to ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker.  The  average rate  for borrowing and lending Treasuries for
one day in the repo market was 0.162 percent yesterday,
according to a GCF repo index provided on a one-day lag by the
Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.  Securities dealers use repos to finance holdings and
increase leverage. Securities that can be borrowed at  interest
rates  close to the Fed’s target rate are called general
collateral. Those in highest demand have lower rates and are
called “special.”  The  average rate  for overnight federal funds, known as the
fed effective rate, was 0.16 percent yesterday. The rate opened
today at 0.16 percent. The effective rate is a volume-weighted
average of trades between major brokers for overnight funds,
reported on a day lag by the  Federal Reserve Bank of New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
