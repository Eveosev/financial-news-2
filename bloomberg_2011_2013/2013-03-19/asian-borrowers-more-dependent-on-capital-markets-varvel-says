Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s Asia head,
Eric Varvel, said companies in the region are boosting reliance
on capital markets for growth rather than syndicated loans.  “The amount of equity in the capital markets sold year-to-
date has pretty much outstripped anything we have seen in the
past,” Varvel, who is also co-chief executive officer of the
investment bank, said in an interview with Bloomberg
Television’s  Susan Li  today. High-yield bond sales have also
climbed to a record as the non-investment grade bond market
“has really developed in a very nice way,” he said.  An increase in investor confidence as the global economy
recovers has pushed up stock benchmarks from the U.S. to Japan,
luring companies to  capital markets . Equity offerings in the
Asia-Pacific region have reached $62.2 billion this year,
surpassing North America’s $56.2 billion and Europe’s $39.8
billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Growth in Asia has resulted in a pick up in mergers and
acquisitions, as well as fund flows into  wealth management 
boosting banks, according to Varvel.  “The amount of net new assets coming into the investment
bank in Asia outstrips anything else we are seeing around the
world,” Varvel said.  While investor confidence has helped lift sentiment, Varvel
said there’s some concern over credit bubbles and an end to the
credit market rally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
