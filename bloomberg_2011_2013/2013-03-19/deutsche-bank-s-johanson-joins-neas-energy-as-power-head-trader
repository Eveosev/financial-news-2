Neas Energy A/S, the Danish energy-
trading company, hired Jesper Johanson from  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  as
head of short-term buying and selling of power.  Johanson, 29, started at Aalborg, Denmark-based Neas Energy
yesterday after leaving Deutsche Bank in  London  last month,
Rasmus Buhl Moeller, a company spokesman, said today by e-mail.
He will help the company expand in European intraday and cross-
border trading, Buhl Moeller said.  Neas hired four power traders and one natural gas trader
last month, seeking growth in markets outside  Denmark  as the
European Commission seeks to boost renewable energy and cross-
border trading. The regulator of the 27-nation bloc is seeks to
create a single regional power and gas market by 2014.  Johanson has also worked at Danske Commodities A/S as head
of power solutions and in short-term trading, Buhl Moeller said.  Neas Energy trades electricity across borders in more than
 20 countries,  including power in  Germany  and the Nordic markets,
and natural gas in Germany and the U.K. It plans to move into
eastern European natural-gas trading, as well as the French
electricity market and the Dutch and Belgian markets, Buhl
Moeller said in September.  To contact the reporter on this story:
