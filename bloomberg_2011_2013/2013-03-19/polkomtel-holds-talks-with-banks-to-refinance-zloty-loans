Polkomtel Sp. z o.o., the mobile
phone company owned by Polish billionaire Zygmunt Solorz-Zak, is
seeking to refinance its zloty loans to cut debt-servicing
costs.  Poland’s second-largest mobile phone company has about 11
billion zloty ($3.43 billion) of outstanding debt it took to
finance its 2011 buyout, including 7.6 billion zloty of loans
denominated in the Polish currency.  “We are in talks with banks as we’re trying to refinance
our zloty debt,” Chief Financial Officer Joanna Nieckarz said
at a press conference today. The Warsaw-based company is
discussing “different scenarios” with banks and expects to
reach an agreement in two to four months.  Polkomtel won’t refinance bonds in the next two years as
the cost of such a move would be “too high,” Nieckarz said.  The operator paid back more than 1 billion zloty of debt
last year, including early repayment of 800 million zloty of
loans in December, Nieckarz said.  “Debt reduction is our priority,” Nieckarz said.  Its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization fell to 2.8 billion zloty in 2012 from 2.83 billion
zloty a year earlier, the company said in a statement. Sales
shrank to 7.13 billion zloty from 7.31 billion zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
