CEZ AS (CEZ)  tumbled to the lowest in
more than seven years as falling electricity prices outweighed
speculation that the biggest Czech utility’s earnings will be
boosted by a new coal-supply contract and an asset sale.  The shares slid 2.1 percent to 564 koruna in  Prague , its
weakest close since August 2005. The stock’s 14-day relative
strength  index  dropped to 27, below the 30 level that signals in
technical analysis the asset may rebound.  Power for next-year delivery in Germany, where CEZ sells
part of its output, fell to a record low as European stocks
retreated on concern the euro area’s debt crisis may get worse.
That overshadowed CEZ’s announcement today that it signed a deal
with Czech Coal to fuel its Pocerady plant, saying the move will
add as much as 2 billion koruna ($100 million) to 2013 operating
profit. CEZ also agreed to sell its Chvaletice coal plant to
Litvinovska Uhelna AS for 4.12 billion koruna.  “The market has so far failed to factor in this positive
news” on the deal with Czech Coal, said  Josef Nemy , an analyst
at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in Prague, in e-mailed comments.  The German power contract dropped 0.3 percent to 40.30
euros a megawatt-hour, the lowest on a closing basis since
Bloomberg began tracking the data in 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
