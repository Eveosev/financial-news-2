Canadian  factory sales  fell in
January, an unexpected decline that was the fourth in five
months, on drops in automobile and aircraft.  Sales fell 0.2 percent to C$48 billion ($46.9 billion),
Statistics Canada said today in Ottawa. None of the 20
economists  surveyed  by Bloomberg forecast a decline, and their
median estimate was for a 0.6 percent gain.  Factory sales have stagnated since the end of 2011 when
they reached about C$50 billion, and the central bank has said
companies need to invest to regain competitiveness hampered by a
strong currency. Finance Minister  Jim Flaherty  has said the
budget he presents March 21 will cut forecasts for revenue and
economic growth.  Motor vehicle sales fell 3.7 percent to C$3.72 billion in
January, bringing the decline over the previous 12 months to
15.5 percent, Statistics Canada said. Aerospace and parts sales
dropped 19.7 percent to C$1.14 billion in the month, still 22.4
percent higher than 12 months earlier.  Petroleum and coal fell 1.8 percent to C$7.05 billion,
while food sales declined 1.3 percent to C$6.68 billion.  Saputo Inc. said March 14 it will close a 100-worker cheese
factory in Warwick, Ontario, in June 2014.  Total factory sales declined 1.6 percent in January from a
year earlier,  Statistics Canada  said.  Sales fell in seven of 21  categories  tracked by Statistics
Canada in January, accounting for 52 percent of production.  Excluding price changes, a better indicator of the
industryâ€™s contribution to economic growth, factory sales fell
0.4 percent.  Unfilled orders rose 5.8 percent to C$69 billion, the
highest since November 2008, on a 10 percent jump in aerospace
backlogs to a record C$39.6 billion.  Inventories rose 1.7 percent to C$65.4 billion, with the
ratio of factory stockpiles to sales rising to 1.36 from 1.34.  New orders rose 5.1 percent to C$51.8 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
