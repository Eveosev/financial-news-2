The Czech koruna snapped two days
of losses after Vice-Governor Mojmir Hampl damped speculation
the central bank will sell the currency.  The koruna strengthened after Hampl said in an interview
with  Bloomberg News  published today that the risk of deflation
in the Czech economy is not high enough to warrant the first
market intervention in a decade. Governor Miroslav Singer said a
week ago the central bank is debating whether to loosen
conditions by selling the koruna in the second half of the year.  “For me personally, a trigger for interventions would be
the moment when I see a highly probable risk of a long-lasting,
devastating deflationary spiral,” Hampl said. “It can’t be
ruled out that this risk will appear in the future, but I don’t
see it materializing for now.”  The Czech currency gained as much as 0.3 percent after
Hampl’s comments and traded 0.1 percent stronger at 25.601 per
euro as of 4:02 p.m. in Prague. It is 4.1 percent weaker than on
Sept. 17, a day before Singer first signaled the possibility of
interventions to counter the nation’s recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
