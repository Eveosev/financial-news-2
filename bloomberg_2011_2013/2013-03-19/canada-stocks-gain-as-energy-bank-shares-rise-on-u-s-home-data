Canadian  stocks  fell for a second
day as commodities producers declined after Cypriot lawmakers
rejected an unprecedented bank levy, sparking concerns Europe’s
debt crisis will worsen.  Pengrowth Energy Corp. (PGF)  lost 1.2 percent as oil retreated
after the euro fell to a three-month low versus the dollar.
Legacy Oil + Gas Inc. slid 5.6 percent after an analyst raised
concerns about its debt. Taseko Mines Ltd. and Teck Resources
Ltd. fell at least 4 percent as copper touched the lowest level
in almost seven months.  Lululemon Athletica Inc. (LLL)  slumped 2.6
percent after it said a shortage of women’s pants will cause
quarterly revenue to miss company forecasts.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 7.89 points,
or 0.1 percent, to 12,773.87 in Toronto, after gaining as much
as 0.4 percent earlier in the day. The S&P/TSX has risen 2.7
percent this year. Trading volume was 5.5 percent below the 30-
day average.  “It’s a knee-jerk reaction, given how small Cyprus is,”
said Anil Tahiliani, a fund manager with McLean & Partners in
Calgary. The firm manages about C$1 billion ($973 million). The
European Union “won’t let Cyprus implode. I think people are
using this as an excuse to take money off the table.”  The island nation’s parliament voted against imposing
losses on depositors, a key demand of European officials in
return for bailout funds. Equities briefly pared losses after
the vote when the European Central Bank said it will provide
liquidity to Cyprus within existing rules.  New Turmoil  While the country accounts for less than half a percent of
the euro economy, the fight over the bank tax risks triggering
new turmoil in the financial crisis that began in 2009 in
Greece.  Canadian stocks rose earlier as data showed U.S. home
 construction  increased by a more-than-estimated 0.8 percent in
February, and building permits climbed to the highest level in
almost five years.  Pengrowth fell 1.2 percent to C$5.60, as oil slid 1.7
percent to settle at $92.16 in New York. The euro declined as
much as 0.9 percent to $1.2844, the lowest since Nov. 22,
reducing the appeal of crude as an investment. Trican Well
Service Ltd. dropped 1.4 percent to C$14.62.  Legacy Oil + Gas tumbled 5.6 percent to C$5.71. Allan Stepa, analyst with Desjardins Securities Inc., said Legacy’s
C$486 million in net debt at the end of 2012 remains a concern.
“The key catalyst for Legacy will be additional measures to
strengthen its balance sheet,” he said in a note to clients
today.  Raw-materials producers contributed most to declines in the
S&P/TSX index, falling 0.3 percent as a group. Taseko Mines
dropped 4 percent to C$2.85 and Teck Resources declined 4.7
percent to C$28.45. Copper futures slid for a third straight
day, losing 0.7 percent to settle at $3.4055 a pound.  Too Sheer  Lululemon erased 2.6 percent to C$65.74, the lowest close
since January. The yoga-wear retailer fell as much as 8.2
percent after saying a shortage of a women’s pants line will
have a “significant” effect on financial results and will lead
to lower-than-forecast first-quarter revenue.  Certain shipments of its black Luon pants are too sheer and
don’t meet the company’s standards, impacting about 17 percent
of all women’s pants in its stores, the company said.  Rona Inc. (RON) , the nation’s largest home-improvement retailer,
advanced 4 percent to C$10.98 after it announced supermarket
executive Robert Sawyer will take over in April as CEO. Sawyer
had been chief operating officer at Metro Inc.  Dundee Industrial Real Estate Investment Trust slipped 1.7
percent to C$10.76 after agreeing to buy C2C Industrial
Properties Inc. in a transaction valued at about C$226 million.
The deal adds a portfolio of more than 2.5 million square feet
of gross leasable area, Dundee said in a statement. C2C soared
26 percent to C$4.68.  To contact the reporter on this story:
