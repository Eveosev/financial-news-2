Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) , the
world’s biggest maker of luxury cars, forecast unchanged 2013
pretax profit as European auto sales drop and BMW increases
spending to bring out 25 new models in the next two years.  “The high returns of the past years can’t be perceived as
the normal state,” Chief Financial Officer Friedrich Eichiner
said today at the Munich-based automaker’s annual press
conference. “We have to deal with high up-front investments in
new technologies to reach our ambitious targets.”  BMW is locked in a tight race with  Volkswagen AG (VOW) ’s Audi for
the global top spot in deliveries, with the BMW brand’s lead
contracting to just 407 vehicles in the first two months. BMW’s
European deliveries dropped 2.8 percent in February as the
region’s car-sales contraction accelerated to 10 percent.  Pretax profit climbed 6 percent to 7.82 billion euros
($10.1 billion) in 2012 as  revenue  rose 12 percent to 76.8
billion euros, the automaker said last week. BMW’s outlook
released today is better than the average analyst forecast of a
1.3 percent profit drop to 7.72 billion euros.  The shares  gained  as much as 1.42 euros, or 2.4 percent, to
71.85 euros on the profit outlook, and were up 1.1 percent as of
12:27 p.m. in  Frankfurt . The stock has dropped 2.6 percent this
year, valuing the company at 45.5 billion euros.  New Models  BMW is bringing out 11 models this year, including the 3-
Series GT and 4-Series coupe, and preparing to roll out its
first electric vehicle, the i3 city car, in pursuit of its third
consecutive year of record sales. Of the 25 new vehicles coming
to market through 2014, 10 of them, such as the X4 sport-utility
vehicle, have no predecessor.  The manufacturer will increase research and development
investments in 2013, Eichiner said, with the percentage of
spending to sales exceeding the targeted range of 5 percent to
5.5 percent. The figure was 5.1 percent in 2012.  BMW joins VW and  Daimler AG (DAI)  in predicting unchanged 2013
profit as the region’s auto market shrinks for a sixth straight
year after dropping to a 17-year low in 2012. All three posted
European sales declines in February, according to data released
today from the ACEA industry group.  “BMW can’t escape the very weak European market and needs
to step up investments as the current models are aging,” said
 Juergen Pieper , a Frankfurt-based analyst with Bankhaus Metzler
who recommends selling the shares.  Slower Growth  BMW’s  sales  globally will probably rise less than 10
percent this year, the automaker said today.  “We’re not going to chase volume at all costs, this is not
our business,” sales chief  Ian Robertson  said in an interview,
adding that he was confident that BMW will “retain the global
premium position on the group level.”  Profitability at  Germany ’s luxury-auto makers is taking a
hit as the BMW, Audi and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz spend money to
stay ahead in design and technology, and  Europe ’s declining auto
market leads to higher discounts.  Earnings before interest and taxes at BMW’s car division
last year declined to 10.9 percent of sales from 11.8 percent in
2011 and lagged behind Audi’s 11 percent margin. Mercedes sank
deeper into third place with an operating margin of 7.1 percent.
BMW’s 2013 return on sales will be in its long-term target range
of 8 percent to 10 percent.  Sales Lead  “An auto margin of 8 percent to 10 percent has always been
ambitious,” Eichiner said. “To still make an 8 percent to 10
percent margin is not a bad forecast.”  BMW solidified its  sales lead  in 2012 with a 12 percent
increase to 1.54 million BMW-brand vehicles on demand for the
new 3-Series sedan, 1-Series compact and X1 and X3 SUVs. Audi’s
deliveries expanded 12 percent to 1.46 million cars, while
Mercedes’s sales rose 4.7 percent to 1.32 million cars.  To secure its grip on the premium segment’s top spot, BMW
last week appointed  Peter Schwarzenbauer , the former Audi sales
chief, to run the Mini, Rolls-Royce and BMW motorcycle brands as
well as after-sales operations. Schwarzenbauer will replace
Harald Krueger, who will become production chief.  The carmaker’s factories are currently running beyond full
capacity to meet customer demand outside Europe, BMW said today.
Mercedes is also expanding production for its compact car
lineup, adding the CLA four-door coupe to complement the new A-
and B-Class vehicles.  “The global financial environment is both uncertain and
volatile,” Chief Executive Officer  Norbert Reithofer  said
today. “Our business performance is exposed to many risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
