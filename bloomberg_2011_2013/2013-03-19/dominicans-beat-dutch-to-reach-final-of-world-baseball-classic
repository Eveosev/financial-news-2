Toronto Blue Jays teammates  Jose Reyes , Edwin Encarnacion and Moises Sierra drove in runs as the
Dominican Republic scored four times in the fifth inning to
defeat the Netherlands 4-1 and reach the final of the World
Baseball Classic.  The Dominicans will face Puerto Rico, which eliminated two-
time defending champion Japan in the other semifinal, for the
title tonight in San Francisco.  Sierra had a run-scoring double and Reyes, a former member
of Major League Baseballâ€™s  New York  Mets, and Encarnacion had
RBI singles in the decisive fifth inning last night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
