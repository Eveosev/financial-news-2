The New York Giants signed former
Carolina Panthers receiver Louis Murphy, adding speed to their
receiving corps.  Murphy, 25, caught 25 passes for 336 yards and one
touchdown for the Panthers last season. He has run the 40-yard
dash in less than 4.4 seconds, the team said on its website.  Giants’ receiver Hakeem Nicks underwent arthroscopic knee
surgery in February, and  Victor Cruz , the team’s reception
leader in 2012, is a restricted free agent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
