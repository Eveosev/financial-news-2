Energy XXI (EXXI)  Bermuda Ltd., the energy
producer that specializes in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, agreed
with  Apache Corp. (APA)  to explore for oil and natural gas off the
coast of Louisiana.  Energy XXI will have a 25 percent working interest in parts
of 135 offshore exploration blocks and 21 non-producing leases,
Stewart Lawrence, a spokesman for the Hamilton, Bermuda-based
company said in an interview today. The company didn’t pay
anything upfront. Lawrence estimated that Energy XXI’s cost will
come to $25 million for seismic testing and $10 million to $15
million apiece for three wells.  Energy XXI has leases in the area, which is in shallow
water southeast of  New Orleans , according to a presentation on
the company’s website.  As part of the agreement, the companies will conduct
seismic tests across 633,000 acres (256,000 hectares) in the
Gulf, including Energy XXI’s existing leases, Lawrence said.  “This joint venture exemplifies our interest in exploring
salt structures where new seismic data, remapping and remodeling
could uncover significant hidden hydrocarbons,” Energy XXI
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Schiller said in a
statement.  Apache, based in Houston, plans to sell $2 billion worth of
assets, and may sell some of its property in the deepwater Gulf
of Mexico.  John Roper , a spokesman for Apache, didn’t immediately
respond to a voice message seeking comment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
