Hydrodec Group Plc (HYR) , a U.K.-based
re-refiner of industrial oils, is nearing an accord to more than
double capacity in the U.S. with a partner.  “This deal is progressing very well and we expect to be in
a position to announce signing of the final agreements within
the next month,” the London-based company said today in a
statement, without identifying the partner. It also reported an
eighth year of sales growth, citing “solid” U.S. performance.  A four-year surge in crude prices has boosted incentives
for companies to recycle waste oils and lubricants that formerly
would have been discarded. Hydrodec is also capitalizing on
environmental rules that restrict disposal of the fluids. Chief
Executive Officer Ian Smale, who spent 30 years at BP Plc before
joining Hydrodec in January 2012, has led its growth as demand
from power utilities expands in North America and  Australia .  The company said in November it was negotiating feedstock
volumes with a potential partner to increase annual capacity in
North America to 65 million liters (17.2 million gallons) from
27 million liters. It plans to add six U.S. production units to
its current four, which may include two at its site in Canton,
 Ohio , Smale said today by telephone.  Sales rose 17 percent last year to a record $26.1 million,
according to the statement. The net loss widened to 3.48 cents a
share from 3.2 cents a year earlier. The  stock , which is listed
on London’s Alternative Investment Market, fell 5.1 percent to
11.625 pence at the close of trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
