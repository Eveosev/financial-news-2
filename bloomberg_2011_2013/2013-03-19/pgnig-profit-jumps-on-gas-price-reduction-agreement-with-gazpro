Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA  said its fourth-quarter profit jumped five-fold
after  Poland ’s dominant gas company agreed to a price cut in its
import contract with  Russia ’s  OAO Gazprom. (GAZP)   Net income rose to 2.19 billion zloty ($684 million) from
431 million zloty a year earlier, PGNiG, as the company is
known, said in an e-mailed statement today. That missed the 2.38
billion-zloty mean estimate of eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  PGNiG, which  sold  almost 15 billion cubic meters of gas
last year, bought about 60 percent of the volume from Gazprom.
In November last year it agreed to lower the price of the long-
term contract with the Russian company by more than 10 percent,
saying it will boost earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization, or Ebitda, by as much as 3
billion zloty.  The fourth-quarter profit helped the state-controlled
company raise its annual net income to 2.24 billion zloty,
according to a regulatory statement today.  PGNiG kept its plan to increase gas output to 4.8 billion
cubic meters this year from 4.4 billion cubic meters in 2012 as
it starts production at its Norwegian offshore well.  The company plans to raise gas production to 6.2 billion
cubic meters in 2015, start output of shale gas and further
increase imports from western  Europe  to cut its dependence on
Russian supplies.  Imports through gas links with the  Czech Republic  and
German rose 18 percent last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
