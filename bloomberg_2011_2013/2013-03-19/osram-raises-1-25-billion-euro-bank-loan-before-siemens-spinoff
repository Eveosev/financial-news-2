Osram GmbH (1184Q) , the lighting unit of
 Siemens AG (SIE) , raised 1.25 billion euros ($1.6 billion) of debt
from banks ahead of its planned spinoff.  The five-year deal comprises a 300 million-euro term loan
and a 950 million-euro credit line, the Munich-based company
said in a statement. The term loan will be partly used to repay
Siemens, it said.  The loans “ensure that Osram has sufficient funding
capability and ample flexibility” after its exit from Siemens,
Klaus Patzak, Osram’s chief financial officer, said.  Siemens won backing from 98 percent of shareholders in
January to separate from Osram. Earlier this month, some
shareholders of Europe’s largest engineering company filed a
motion against the move, preventing Osram’s shares from being
listed in April.  The debt was arranged by Commerzbank AG, Deutsche Bank AG,
Goldman Sachs Group Inc., UBS AG and  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , according to
the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
