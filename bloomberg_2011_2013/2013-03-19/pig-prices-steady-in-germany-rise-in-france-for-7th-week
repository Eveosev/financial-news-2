Pig prices were little changed in
much of western  Europe  while increasing for a seventh straight
week in  France , industry group Interessengemeinschaft der
Schweinehalter Deutschlands e.V. said.  Prices were unchanged in Germany, the European Union’s
biggest pork producer, at 1.626 euros a kilogram (96 cents a
pound) for a fourth straight week, Damme, Germany-based ISN
wrote in an online  report  today. Dutch, Danish, Belgian, Spanish
and Irish prices also were steady. French prices rose to 1.696
euros a kilogram, up 3.4 percent from a week earlier.  “In France, the slaughter companies’ demand was noticeably
higher than were the quantities of live pigs on offer,” ISN
said.  Pig prices rose in the past week in the U.K. and fell in
Italy and  Austria .  To contact the reporter on this story:
