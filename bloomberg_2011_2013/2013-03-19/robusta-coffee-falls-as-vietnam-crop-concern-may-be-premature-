Robusta coffee fell for a second
day on concern producers are selling as speculation about dry
weather in leading grower  Vietnam  may be “premature” and the
country’s exports will rise again this month. Cocoa rose.  Speculation about drought in Vietnam is “a bit premature”
as the rainy season usually starts in April, Amsterdam-based
trader  Nedcoffee BV  said in a report e-mailed yesterday.
Shipments from the Southeast Asian nation may climb to 135,000
metric tons this month, the trader estimated. Coffee exports in
February were 100,380 tons, a 54 percent decline from a month
earlier, data from Vietnam’s General Customs department showed.  “There have been a number of stories about concerns over
the Vietnamese crop and the impact of drought on next year’s
harvest,” Judy Ganes-Chase, president of J. Ganes Consulting,
said in a report yesterday. “Weather analysis shows that there
has been rainfall and the pattern is expected to improve, so it
may be too fast to assume that the crop is in trouble.”  Robusta coffee for delivery in May was down 0.4 percent at
$2,167 a ton by 10:46 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in  London . It fell 0.7
percent yesterday. Arabica coffee for delivery in May rose 0.4
percent to $1.3495 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York .  Arabica coffee fell as much as 2.5 percent yesterday to
$1.3405 a pound, the lowest since June 2010.  Bean stockpiles  in
warehouses monitored by ICE were 2.75 million bags as of
yesterday, the highest since March 2010. “Plentiful” supply is
weighing on prices, Carsten Fritsch, an analyst at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt , said in a report e-mailed today.  Coffee growers in Brazil, the world’s top producer, are
withholding beans waiting for higher prices. Growers had sold 71
percent of last year’s crop by Feb. 28, down from 87 percent a
year earlier, according to researcher Safras & Mercado.  “This measure has had little success, which is why
 Brazil ’s government is now also discussing ways it could support
the coffee price,” Fritsch said.  White sugar for May delivery was up 0.5 percent to $529.90
a ton on NYSE Liffe. Raw sugar for May delivery gained 0.4
percent to 18.37 cents a pound on ICE.  Cocoa for May delivery rose 0.2 percent to 1,417 pounds
($2,141) a ton in London. Cocoa for May delivery advanced 0.6
percent to $2,100 a ton in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
