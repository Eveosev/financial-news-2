OAO Mostotrest, the bridge and road
builder part-owned by  Vladimir Putin ’s judo partner Arkady Rotenberg, climbed for the first time in six days on speculation
the company will benefit from his Winter Olympics contracts.  Mostotrest gained 1.8 percent, the most since Feb. 25, to
139.15 rubles by 5:13 p.m. in Moscow. The amount of shares
traded was about 93,000, equivalent to 72 percent of the three-
month daily average.  Rotenberg’s companies have been awarded at least 227
billion rubles ($7.4 billion) of contracts for the 2014 Sochi
Games, according to figures compiled from corporate and
government filings. The bulk of Rotenberg’s Olympic contracts
are held by Mostotrest, according to the company website.
Rotenberg and partners, including his son Igor, gained control
of  Mostotrest (MSTT)  in 2010, just before the company raised $388
million in an initial public offering.  “The stock lost a lot of steam last week,” Ksenia Arutyunova, an analyst at Rye, MAN & Gor Securities, said by
phone from Moscow. “Rotenberg’s participation in the Olympic
projects is supporting the stock, since he, as their main
shareholder, will guarantee them success in the Olympic
ventures.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
