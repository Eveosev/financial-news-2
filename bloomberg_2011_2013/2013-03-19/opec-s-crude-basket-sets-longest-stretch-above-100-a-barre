The average price of benchmark OPEC
crudes held above $100 a barrel for a 173rd trading day, the
gauge’s longest-ever stretch at this level.  The so-called OPEC  basket , a weighted average of the main
grades produced by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, was at $106.36 a barrel yesterday. Its spell at
higher than $100 since July 17 surpasses a previous 168-day
record set from Feb. 21, 2011, to Sept. 30 that year.  Brent, used to price more than half of the world’s crude,
climbed as high as $119.17 on Feb. 8 amid signs of economic
recovery in the U.S. and China, and concern that political
conflicts in the  Middle East  and North Africa may lead to a
disruption in supplies. OPEC members earned in excess of $1
trillion from oil sales for the second straight year in 2012.  The OPEC Reference Basket of Crudes is composed of Saharan
Blend from Algeria, Girassol from Angola, Oriente from Ecuador,
Iran Heavy from the Islamic republic of Iran, Basra Light from
Iraq, Kuwait Export from Kuwait, Es Sider from Libya,  Bonny
Light  from Nigeria, Qatar Marine from Qatar, Arab Light from
 Saudi Arabia , Murban from the United Arab Emirates and Merey
from Venezuela.  To contact the reporter on this story:
