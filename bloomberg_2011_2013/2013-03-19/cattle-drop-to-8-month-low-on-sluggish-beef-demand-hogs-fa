Cattle futures fell to an eight-
month low on signs of slowing demand for U.S. beef. Hog prices
also dropped.  About 119,000 cattle were processed yesterday, down 0.8
percent from a week earlier and 3.3 percent fewer than the same
period in 2012, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Wholesale  beef  slumped 0.8 percent last week to $1.9576 a pound,
the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 1, according to USDA data.  “Beef markets were sluggish again yesterday,” Troy Vetterkind, the owner of Vetterkind Cattle Brokerage LLC in
Thorp,  Wisconsin , said in an e-mailed report. “Demand for beef
at retail remains dull, and there is a lot of competition from
cheaper pork and chicken right now.”  Cattle futures for June delivery dropped 0.8 percent to
$1.2045 a pound at 11:40 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, after touching $1.204, the lowest for the most-active
contract since July 18.  Feeder-cattle futures for May settlement declined 1.4
percent to $1.392 a pound in  Chicago .  Hog futures for June settlement fell 0.8 percent to 88.225
cents a pound in Chicago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
