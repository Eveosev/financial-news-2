China ’s money-market rate dropped
to the lowest level in more than a week on speculation higher
overseas investments will boost cash in the financial system.  Foreign direct investment  rose 6.3 percent from a year
earlier to $8.21 billion in February, the Ministry of Commerce
said in a statement today in Beijing. That’s the first increase
in nine months. China’s central bank sold 39 billion  yuan  ($6.3
billion) of 28-day repurchase agreements today at 2.75 percent,
and has refrained from adding capital to the financial system
via reverse-repurchase contracts since Feb. 7.  “Foreign inflows into China may be rising,” said  Frances Cheung , a senior strategist at Credit Agricole CIB in Hong Kong.
“Liquidity remains at a pretty ample level.”  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, dropped eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 2.95 percent as of 10:49 a.m. in  Shanghai ,
according to a weighted average compiled by the National
Interbank Funding Center. It touched 2.945 percent earlier, the
lowest level since March 8.  The one-year interest-rate swap, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, was unchanged at
3.27 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 2.91 percent government bonds due April
2015 was steady at 3.069 percent, according to the Interbank
Funding Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
