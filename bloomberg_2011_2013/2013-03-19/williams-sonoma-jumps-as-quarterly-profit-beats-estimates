Williams-Sonoma Inc. (WSM) , the owner of
the namesake, Pottery Barn and West Elm home-goods chains,
advanced after reporting quarterly profit that exceeded analyst
estimates, a buyback program and a dividend increase.  The shares jumped as much as 8.3 percent to $48.97 in
extended trading, after slipping 0.8 percent to $45.21 at the
close in New York.  Net income for the fourth quarter were $1.34 a share,
compared with $1.17 a share a year earlier, the San Francisco-
based company said in a statement today. Analysts projected
$1.28 a share, the average of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Williams-Sonoma’s revenue exceeded analyst estimates after
sales at West Elm soared by almost a fifth. An improved U.S.
housing market has encouraged consumers to refurnish their
homes.  Revenue increased 11 percent to $1.41 billion, ahead of the
$1.39 billion average estimate of analysts. Sales at stores open
at least a year gained 19 percent at West Elm, and Pottery Barn
Kids’ advanced 7.7 percent. The namesake stores’ sales fell 1.6
percent.  The company also announced today it increased its quarterly
dividend to 31 cents a share from 22 cents a share and said its
board authorized a new $750 million stock repurchase program.  It also said that Janet Hayes would become the new
president of the Williams-Sonoma brand, replacing Richard
Harvey, who is departing after 30 years at the company. Hayes
has been president of Pottery Barn Kids and PBteen.  To contact the reporters on this story:
