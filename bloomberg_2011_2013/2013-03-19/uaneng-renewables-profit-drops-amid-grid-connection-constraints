Huaneng Renewables Corp. (958) , a clean-
energy unit of  China ’s biggest electricity producer, said profit
declined 46 percent last year as grid bottlenecks limited the
amount of electricity that could be produced from its wind
farms.  Net income fell to 558 million  yuan  ($89.7 million) in 2012
from 1.02 billion yuan a year earlier, the unit of China Huaneng
Group Corp. said today  in a filing  to the Hong Kong stock
exchange. Profit was projected at 591 million yuan, according to
the mean of five analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.
Revenue increased 26 percent to 4.03 billion yuan.  Growth in wind power in China has been limited by the
electricity grid’s ability to handle the influx of energy,
forcing the government to tighten approvals on new projects and
slow the development of the industry. Installations of wind
turbines in China fell 18 percent to 15.9 gigawatts last year
from 2011, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance data.  Huaneng Renewables was downgraded to hold from buy after a
67 percent rally in the shares in the past three months and
because of a possible share placement, analysts led by Kai-Ting Wong at Deutsche Bank AG said in a March 18 note.  The stock fell 1 percent to HK$1.98 in Hong Kong trading
today, before the results were announced.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
