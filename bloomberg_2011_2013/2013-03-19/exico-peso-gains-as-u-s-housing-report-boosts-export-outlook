Mexico ’s peso declined amid
increasing investor concern that a bailout for Cyprus will
falter, fanning  Europe ’s debt crisis and damping global growth.  The currency depreciated 0.3 percent to 12.4544 per U.S.
dollar at 11:20 a.m. in Mexico City, the biggest fall on a
closing basis since March 6. The drop pared its gain against the
dollar this year to 3.2 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The peso slumped with most major emerging market tenders as
lawmakers in the Mediterranean island nation rejected a levy on
bank deposits, risking the country’s bailout package and its
membership in the euro. Europe’s debt crisis is reducing
investor demand for emerging-market assets, said  Ramon Cordova ,
a currency trader at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia,
Mexico.  “The peso represents something for  emerging markets ,”
Cordova said in an e-mailed response to questions. “It’s the
only currency that’s freely convertible with acceptable volume”
in Latin America.  Mexico isn’t planning measures to curb the peso’s gains
this year, Deputy Finance Minister Fernando Aportela said in an
interview in Panama City on March 17.  The currency has gained 2.5 percent since policy makers cut
benchmark borrowing costs by 0.5 percentage point on March 8 to
a record-low 4 percent.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 dropped two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 4.97 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.18 centavo to
144.70 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
