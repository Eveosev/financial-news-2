Gasoline fell as Brent crude oil,
the pricing basis for gasoline imports, weakened versus West
Texas Intermediate. Gasoline’s crack spread over WTI narrowed to
the lowest level in a month.  Futures lost as much as 2.6 percent as Brent’s  premium  to
WTI slipped to a two-month low. Brent weakened amid a recovery
in North Sea oil production, the imminent return of South  Sudan 
oil exports and concern that an upcoming vote in Cyprus on an
unprecedented bank levy threatens the euro area economy.  “The Brent is clearly being impacted by the events in
Cyprus and concerns over the economy in Europe and the return of
North sea oil production and exports from the Sudan,” said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Gasoline for April delivery fell 6.98 cents, or 2.2
percent, to $3.0591 a gallon at 12:51 p.m. on the  New York 
Mercantile Exchange as trading volume was 24 percent above the
100-day average for the time of day. The contract is for
reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol, or RBOB.  Cypriot lawmakers may shoot down the tax on bank deposits,
risking the island’s membership in the euro.  The “feeling I’m having is that the house is going to
reject it because they feel and think it isn’t just and that
it’s against the interest of Cyprus,” Cypriot President Nicos
Anastasiades told  Sweden ’s TV4 channel in an interview today.  Crack Spreads  The April  crack spread  versus WTI narrowed $2.07 to $35.60
a barrel. The May  spread  against Brent oil on ICE Futures Europe
Exchange fell $1.33 to $20.10.  The premium of Brent over WTI dropped 48 cents to $14.92 a
barrel, and touched $14.67, the smallest gap since Jan. 17.  Gasoline futures fell as low as $3.0478, the lowest
intraday price this month, on speculation that supplies will
rise as refineries complete spring maintenance and increase
production to take advantage of wide profit margins.  Planned turnarounds between January and March took 1.13
million barrels a day of crude processing capacity offline,
according to IIR Energy, a Sugar Land, Texas-based energy-
information provider. From April to June, that figure will drop
to 676,000 barrels.  “U.S. refineries are starting to come back from turnaround
and that is definitely impacting product markets,” said Amrita Sen, chief oil market strategist at Energy Aspects Ltd., a
research company in  London .  Gasoline Production  Gasoline output  rose 4 percent to 8.95 million barrels a
day in the week ended March 8 even as refiners  processed  the
least amount of oil in almost two years, Energy Information
Administration data show.  “These are good refinery margins and when refineries come
out of maintenance, gasoline supplies should increase,” said
Phil Flynn, senior market analyst at Price Futures Group in
 Chicago .  The EIA is scheduled to report last week’s inventories
tomorrow. The agency will probably say  gasoline stockpiles 
declined 1.88 million barrels while distillate supplies fell 1
million barrels, according to the median of 10 analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Heating oil for April delivery declined 6.2 cents, or 2.1
percent, to $2.8647 a gallon on volume that was 64 percent above
the 100-day average for the time of day. Prices touched $2.859,
the lowest intraday level since Aug. 3.  Gasoil for April delivery declined $13 to $900 a metric ton
on ICE, after touching a three-month low of $898.75.  “Gasoil is very weak in  Europe  and that is affecting
heating oil,” Sen said.  Gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.7 cent to
$3.692 a gallon, AAA said today on its website. It was the first
increase in six days. Prices have dropped 9.4 cents since
reaching year-to-date high of $3.786 on Feb. 26 and are 15 cents
below a year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
