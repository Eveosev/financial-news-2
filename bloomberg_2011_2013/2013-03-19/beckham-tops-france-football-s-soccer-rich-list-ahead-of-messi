David Beckham  is soccer’s best-paid
player ahead of four-time world player of the year Lionel Messi,
according to France Football magazine’s 15th annual list of the
sport’s top earners.  Beckham, who joined Paris Saint-Germain on a five-month
contract in January, will earn 36 million euros ($46.6 million)
in 2012-13, of which 5 percent is made up from his salary, with
the majority coming from other sources including endorsements,
France Football said on its  website . Beckham, 37, said after
signing for PSG that his salary would be donated to a charity.  Messi’s income of 35 million euros includes 13 million
euros in salary and bonuses, France Football said. The 25-year-
old Argentine, who broke soccer’s calendar-year scoring record
in 2012, extended his contract with Barcelona in December
through June 2018.  Real Madrid and Portugal forward  Cristiano Ronaldo , 28, was
third on France Football’s list with total income of 30 million
euros, including 13.5 million from salary and bonuses.  Real’s  Jose Mourinho  is soccer’s best-paid coach, earning
14 million euros a year, according to France Football. PSG’s
 Carlo Ancelotti  is second with 12 million euros ahead of fellow
Italian Marcello Lippi, who was paid 11 million euros in salary
and bonuses for coaching Guangzhou Evergrande to the 2012
