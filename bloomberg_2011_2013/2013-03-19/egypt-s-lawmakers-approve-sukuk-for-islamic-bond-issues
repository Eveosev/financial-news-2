Egyptian lawmakers approved the
country’s first sukuk law today, paving the way for the
government to take part in a market that hit a record $46
billion of debt sales last year.  The law allows the state and its related entities to issue
Shariah-compliant debt locally and internationally. Capital
gains and coupon payments will be exempt from tax, according to
the state-run  Middle East News Agency .  Egypt  is looking for ways to secure foreign currency as a
$4.8 billion loan from the International Monetary Fund remains
stalled by political unrest. The country may raise as much as $1
billion by June from sale of its first Islamic bonds, Ahmed El-
Naggar, adviser to Finance Minister El-Morsi El-Sayed Hegazi,
said last month.  Today’s approval of the law is final, meaning it won’t be
sent for further review by Al Azhar, Sunni Islam’s highest
authority, state-run news website Ahram Gate reported.  To contact the reporters on this story:
