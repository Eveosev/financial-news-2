India ’s rupee rose to the highest
level this month on speculation the central bank will lower
borrowing costs today to boost economic growth and as concerns
about  Europe ’s debt crisis receded.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will cut its benchmark  repurchase
rate  to 7.50 percent from 7.75 percent when it announces its
decision at 11 a.m. in Mumbai, according to 30 of 35 economists
in a Bloomberg News survey. Five predict no change. Euro-area
finance ministers signaled flexibility on the terms of Cyprus’s
rescue, suggesting that less-wealthy depositors could be
exempted from taxes used to fund a bailout.  “A 25 basis point cut has been priced in,” said Ravi
Ranjit, chief manager at  Federal Bank Ltd. (FB)  in Mumbai. “While
anything more is unlikely, anything less will be a huge
disappointment for the market. The tone will also be looked at
very closely considering the overall inflation-growth dynamic.”  The rupee advanced 0.4 percent to 53.9550 per dollar as of
9:50 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It
touched 53.8950 earlier, the strongest level since Feb. 28. One-
month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, fell nine basis points, or
0.09 percentage point, to 9.13 percent.  Inflation, Growth  Gross domestic product  in Asia’s third-largest economy rose
4.5 percent in the last quarter of 2012, the slowest since 2009,
and the government forecasts an annual growth rate of around 5
percent, the lowest in a decade. While  wholesale-price inflation 
unexpectedly accelerated to 6.84 percent in February, a measure
that excludes food prices climbed only 3.8 percent. Consumer
prices rose 10.91 percent from 10.79 percent.  European policy makers on March 16 imposed an unprecedented
levy on Cypriot bank savings, triggering concern that this could
cause runs on lenders across Europe and further destabilize the
financial system. The  Federal Reserve  starts a two-day policy
meeting today.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards traded at 55.02 per
dollar, compared with 55.26 yesterday, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Offshore non-deliverable contracts were
at 54.88 versus 55.18. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
