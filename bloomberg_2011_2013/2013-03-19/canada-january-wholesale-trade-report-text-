The following is the text
of  Canada ’s wholesale trade report for January from
 Statistics Canada .  Wholesale sales rose by 0.3% in January to $49.0 billion.
The increase was mainly a result of higher sales in the computer
and communications equipment and supplies industry.  In volume terms, wholesale sales were up 0.5% in January.  Increase led by the computer and communications equipment and
supplies industry  In January, four of the seven subsectors, accounting for
about two-thirds of wholesale sales, reported gains.  Sales in the machinery, equipment and supplies subsector
rose 3.2%, almost offsetting the decline observed in December.
January’s advance reflects an 8.0% increase in the sales of the
computer and communications equipment and supplies industry,
which posted its largest gain since April 2008. For the third
consecutive month, this industry was the main contributor to
sales movement at the national level. This coincided with the
release of new products at the end of 2012.  The second-largest increase was in the personal and
household goods subsector (+1.0%). The key contributors to
January’s advance were the toiletries, cosmetics and sundries
industry and the textiles, clothing and footwear industry.  Sales were up 0.7% in the food, beverages and tobacco
subsector, its first monthly increase in three months. All three
component industries of this subsector reported gains.  These increases were partly offset by a 2.8% decline in the
motor vehicle and parts subsector, its fifth decrease since July
2012. January’s decline in sales reflected a 3.4% decrease in
the motor vehicle industry.  Sales growth concentrated in Quebec  Sales were up in nine provinces in January.  Most of the sales growth in dollars was concentrated in
 Quebec , where sales rose 2.2%, the first advance in three months.
Wholesalers in the province posted higher sales in the personal
and household goods subsector and the food, beverage and tobacco
subsector.  In Western Canada, Saskatchewan (+1.2%) recorded the
largest increase, as a result of higher sales in the
agricultural supplies industry, which accounts for about 35% of
wholesale sales in the province.  The four Atlantic provinces posted gains, with Newfoundland
and Labrador (+4.3%) registering the largest growth in sales.  Ontario was the lone province that posted a decrease in
sales. Wholesale sales were down 0.5% in January, the fifth
decrease since July 2012. The declines were largely a result of
lower sales in the motor vehicle industry.  Increase in inventories  Wholesale inventories rose 1.2% in January to $61.5 billion.
Inventories were up in 18 of the 25 industries.  The largest increases in dollar terms were in the
inventories of the personal goods industry (+10.4%) and the
construction, forestry, mining and industrial machinery,
equipment and supplies industry (+1.5%).  The inventory-to-sales ratio rose to 1.25 in January.  The inventory-to-sales ratio is a measure of the time in
months required to exhaust inventories if sales were to remain
at their current level.  Note to readers  All the data in this release are seasonally adjusted and in
