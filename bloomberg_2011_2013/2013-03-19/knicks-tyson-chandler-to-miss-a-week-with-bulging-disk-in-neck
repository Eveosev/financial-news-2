New York  Knicks center Tyson Chandler will be out for about another week after tests found a
bulging disk in his neck, the team said.  The National Basketball Association club also said on
Twitter that forward Kurt Thomas, who had been starting in
Chandler’s place, will miss two to four weeks after tests
revealed an acute reaction surrounding a stress fracture in his
right foot.  The 7-foot-1 Chandler, the Knicks’ leading rebounder, sat
out the past three games with a neck strain and would miss at
least another three if he’s sidelined the next seven days.
Chandler, 30, is averaging 10.7 points and 11 rebounds a game
this season.  Thomas, 40, is averaging 2.5 points and 2.3 rebounds in 39
games this season.  New York is without forwards Amar’e Stoudemire and Rasheed Wallace for the rest of the regular season because of injuries,
while leading scorer Carmelo Anthony has missed six of the past
eight games with a pulled hamstring that led to knee trouble.  The Knicks (39-26) ended a four-game losing streak last
night and remain one game ahead of the second-place Brooklyn
Nets atop the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic Division.  To contact the reporter on this story:
