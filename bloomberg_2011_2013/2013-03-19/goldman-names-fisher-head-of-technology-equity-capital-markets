Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  named Andy Fisher head of technology equity capital markets, effective
immediately, according to a memo to employees.  Fisher will report to David Ludwig, who leads technology,
media and telecom equity capital markets, the firm’s executives
wrote in the memo today, a copy of which was obtained by
 Bloomberg News .  Michael DuVally , a spokesman for the New York-
based bank, confirmed the memo’s contents.  Goldman Sachs earned $987 million in equity underwriting
revenue last year, a 9 percent decline from 2011, the firm  said 
in January. For the fourth quarter of 2012, that revenue surged
59 percent to $304 million from a year earlier.  “Goldman Sachs has enjoyed significant momentum in
technology equity,” the bank said in the memo. “Andy was a key
part of that success, having led many of our most important and
meaningful transactions for the firm.”  Fisher, based in San Francisco, joined Goldman Sachs in
2005, according to Financial Industry Regulatory Authority
records. He previously worked at Credit Suisse Group AG, the
records show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
