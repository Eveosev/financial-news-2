The Miami Heat pushed their winning
streak to 23 games, the second-longest run in National
Basketball Association history, by beating the Boston Celtics
105-103 on a LeBron James jump shot with 10.5 seconds left.  James scored a team-leading 37 points for the Heat, who
trailed by as many as 17 points last night in Boston and were
down 96-83 with eight minutes remaining.  Miami overcame a 43-point effort from Boston’s  Jeff Green 
to improve its NBA-best record to 52-14 and surpass the 2007-08
 Houston Rockets  for sole possession of the second-best winning
streak in league history. The 1971-72  Los Angeles Lakers  hold
the record with 33 consecutive victories.  “It means a lot for the simple fact that we’ve gotten
better,” James, who added 12 assists and seven rebounds, said
in a televised interview. “This is a hostile environment and to
come in here and get a big win on the road was awesome.”  The New York Knicks halted a four-game losing streak with a
90-83 road win against the Utah Jazz last night.  J.R. Smith scored 20 points to lead the Knicks, who were
again without  Carmelo Anthony , Amar’e Stoudemire and  Tyson Chandler  due to injury and needed a win to stay one game ahead
of the Brooklyn Nets atop the Eastern Conference’s Atlantic
Division. The Nets routed the Detroit Pistons 119-82.  The  Denver Nuggets  extended their winning streak to 12
games by beating the Chicago Bulls 119-118 in overtime. The
Nuggets held on for the win as a tip-in basket by the Bulls’
Joakim Noah with 1.7 seconds left was ruled goaltending.  Lakers Lose  The Los Angeles Lakers were beaten for the fourth time in
15 games since the NBA All-Star break, losing 99-76 to the
 Phoenix Suns  as  Kobe Bryant  missed his second game in a row
because of a sprained left ankle.  The Heat, who haven’t lost since Feb. 3, trailed  Boston 
41-24 last night before pulling within 59-53 at halftime. They
carried the momentum into the second half, hitting four of their
first five shots to grab a 61-59 lead.  Boston, which was without  Kevin Garnett  due to the flu,
responded behind Green, who hit 14 of 21 shots including five of
his seven attempts from 3-point range. Green scored 13 of the
Celtics’ 14 points during one stretch, helping them take an
85-78 lead less than a minute into the fourth quarter.  The Heat rallied again behind James, who scored nine points
to fuel an 18-4 run that put Miami back in front 101-100 with
2:40 left. James then made a layup with 1:21 remaining to tie
the score 103-103 and hit the winning jumper over Green from
just inside the 3-point line.  Paul Pierce , who added 17 points for Boston, missed a
potential go-ahead 3-pointer with 4.9 seconds on the clock and
Miami held on for an 11th straight road victory.  “No matter who’s in uniform for those guys, they’ve got a
championship DNA and we had to work for it,” James said. “We
were down a lot of times, more than we would like to be, but we
got enough defensive stops, executed offensively and I was able
to make one more play down the stretch.”  The Heat next play tomorrow in Cleveland against the 22-45
Cavaliers before returning home for games against the Pistons
(23-46) and Charlotte Bobcats (15-52). They won’t play a team
with a winning record until March 27 in Chicago (36-30).  To contact the reporter on this story:
