Soybeans fell for a sixth straight
session in Chicago after Reuters reported that  China , the
world’s biggest consumer, canceled almost 2 million metric tons
of supplies from  Brazil  because of shipping delays.  The cancellation by Chinese soybean trader Sunrise Group
included 10 cargoes that had been scheduled to arrive in January
and February and another 23 contracted to ship from April to
June, Shao Guorui, a manager at the company, said, according to
Reuters. Brazil is expected to overtake the U.S. this year as
the world’s top exporter. Grain trucks were waiting in a 15-mile
line to deliver supplies to the Port of Santos by March 15, road
operator Ecovias said.  “One of China’s largest private soybean importers has
canceled some of its Brazilian purchases due to shipping
delays,” Joe Vaclavik, the president at Standard Grain Inc. in
 Chicago , said in an e-mailed report today. “There is no
confirmation on whether or not the purchases would be switched
to the U.S. Some believe they may be switched to  Argentina .”  Soybeans for May delivery fell 0.2 percent to $14.0675 a
bushel by 8:36 a.m. on the Chicago Board of Trade. Volume was 39
percent below the 100-day average for that time of the day. The
oilseed is down 5 percent since March 11.  Corn for May delivery was little changed at $7.2025 a
bushel, after touching $7.245, the highest for a most-active
contract since Feb. 6.  Wheat futures for May delivery fell 0.1 percent to $7.1175
a bushel in Chicago. In Paris, milling wheat for the same
delivery month increased 0.4 percent to 235.75 euros ($305.20) a
ton on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
