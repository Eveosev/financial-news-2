Rona Inc. (RON) , Canada’s largest home-
improvement retailer, named Robert Sawyer president and chief
executive officer.  Sawyer, an executive at grocery store chain  Metro Inc. (MRU) ,
will take over next month, the Boucherville, Quebec-based
company said today in a statement. Acting CEO Dominique Boies
will remain chief financial officer.  Rona revamped its board in January after its two largest
shareholders, Pension funds Caisse de Depot et Placement du
Quebec and Invesco Canada Ltd., pushed out longtime CEO Robert
Dutton amid dissatisfaction with five years of declining
profitability. Dutton was at the helm when Rona last year
rejected a C$14.50-a-share takeover offer from Lowe’s Cos.  Rona is now deciding whether to sell big-box stores outside
Quebec and working to boost profit by cutting jobs and shrinking
or selling underperforming units.  The shares  rose  4 percent to C$10.98 at the close in
Toronto. Rona has gained 2.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
