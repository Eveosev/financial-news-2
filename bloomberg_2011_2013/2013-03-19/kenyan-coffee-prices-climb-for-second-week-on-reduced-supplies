Coffee prices rose for a second
week at an auction in  Kenya , East  Africa ’s biggest economy,
after supplies of the beans declined.  The average price for all coffee sold climbed 4 percent to
$212.96 for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag from $204.73 a week
ago, the Nairobi Coffee Exchange said today. The benchmark AA
grade gained 4.1 percent to an average of $352.49 a bag and sold
for as much as $458, it said.  Supplies from the nation, which sells its beans to
countries including  Germany , the U.S. and  Sweden , fell 15
percent to 22,774 bags from 26,890 bags a week ago, the exchange
said. Quality was good although unchanged from the prior week,
it said. Arabica coffee slid 6.3 percent this month in  New York 
trading, according to figures compiled by Bloomberg.  “Supply was less and the quality of coffee was good,”
Kizito Keya, a trader at Mumba Coffee Ltd., said by telephone
from Nairobi.  Kenya was Africa’s fifth-biggest exporter of the beans from
December 2011 through November last year, according to the
London-based International Coffee Organization. Arabica is
favored for specialty beverages.  Sales at the auction fell 53 percent to 5,583 bags worth
$1.46 million from 11,975 bags valued at $2.98 million last
week, the exchange said.  Kenya harvests its early crop from May through July and the
main crop from September through December, according to the
Kenya Coffee Producers and Traders Association, which owns the
Nairobi exchange. The nation’s coffee season runs from Oct. 1
through September.  Output this season may fall to 45,000 metric tons after low
global prices discouraged investment, Louise Wanjira Njeru,
managing director at the Coffee Board of Kenya, said Feb. 15.  Following are details of today’s auction in U.S. dollars
