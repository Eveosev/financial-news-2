China’s stocks rose the most in
almost two weeks, led by property developers and power
producers, on optimism over corporate earnings and as foreign
direct investment gained for the first time in nine months.  Huaneng Power International Inc. (600011)  and  Huadian Power
International Corp. (600027)  climbed more than 2 percent as UOB-Kay Hian
Ltd. said power suppliers may join China Resources Power
Holdings Co. in reporting higher annual profit. China Merchants
Property Development Co. jumped 5.3 percent, leading a rally for
developers, after earnings climbed.  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  added 0.8 percent to 2,257.43
at the close, the biggest gain since March 6. The measure
dropped 1.7 percent yesterday after Guo Shuqing was replaced as
head of the securities regulator and a levy on bank deposits in
Cyprus threatened to plunge  Europe  back into crisis. The index
has slid 7.3 percent from this year’s peak on Feb. 6 amid
concern an economic recovery will falter as officials take steps
to cool the property market and restrain inflation.  “It’s a fact that developers’ earnings will be good this
year,” said Tang Yonggang, analyst at Hongyuan Securities Co.
in Beijing. “Stocks fell yesterday out of fear. Investors were
concerned about monetary tightening, more property measures and
the new regulator is seen as a negative. It’s unlikely there’s
going to be monetary tightening soon.”  The CSI 300 Index gained 0.9 percent to 2,525.10 today,
while the  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in Hong Kong retreated less than 0.1 percent. The
 Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded
U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell 0.7 percent in New York
yesterday.  Economic Reports  Inbound investment gained 6.3 percent from a year earlier
to $8.21 billion in February, the Ministry of Commerce said in a
statement today in Beijing. That compared with the median
estimate of a 4.8 percent decline in a Bloomberg survey and a
7.3 percent decline the previous month.  “China’s attractiveness remain for foreign investors, from
its relatively-developed infrastructure to stable macroeconomic
growth,” said Sun Junwei, a Beijing-based economist with HSBC
Holdings Plc. “As the global economy recovers,  China  may
continue to see a steady inflow of investments this year,
helping the overall China recovery story.”  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics are due to release a
preliminary manufacturing index for this month on March 21. The
gauge may rise to 50.8 from 50.4 in February, according to the
median estimate of 11 analysts in a Bloomberg survey. A reading
above 50 indicates expansion.  Utilities Gain  The Shanghai gauge was valued at 9.2 times estimated
earnings for the next 12 months yesterday, the lowest level
since Dec. 13, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg. Trading
volumes were 28 percent lower than the 30-day average today,
according to Bloomberg data. Thirty-day  volatility  in the gauge
was at 21.4, close to the highest in a year.  A measure of utilities in the CSI 300 advanced 2.7 percent,
the most among the 10 industry groups. Huaneng Power, the listed
unit of China’s largest power group, gained 2.8 percent to 7.08
 yuan . Huadian Power International Corp., the listed unit of the
fourth-biggest power producer, climbed 2.5 percent to 4.57 yuan.
China Resource Power Holdings Co. jumped 9.3 percent in Hong
Kong after reporting net income for 2012 that exceeded forecasts
yesterday.  “China Resources Power significantly outperformed market
consensus and to some extent make investors believe that other
bigger coal-fired power suppliers will also report higher-than-
expected results,” Shi Yan, an analyst at UOB-Kay Hian in
Shanghai, said by phone.  Developers’ Earnings  Merchants Property added 5.3 percent to 2444 yuan after net
income jumped 28 percent from a year earlier in 2012. The
earnings per-share of 1.932 yuan beat the estimate of 1.917
yuan, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Vanke Co., the nation’s biggest listed property
developer, rose 2.4 percent to 10.95 yuan.  Poly Real Estate
Group Co. (600048) , the second largest, added 4 percent to 11.19 yuan.  A gauge of pharmaceutical stocks slid 1 percent, the
second-biggest loss among the CSI 300’s industry groups. The
index had gained 17 percent through yesterday this year.  Shanghai Fosun Pharmaceutical (Group) Co. (600196)  fell 2.7 percent
to 11.32 yuan. Zhejiang Medicine Co. lost 2.1 percent to 21.63
yuan. Kangmei Pharmaceutical Co. slid 1.3 percent to 15.88 yuan.  Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Co., a unit of China’s biggest
light-truck exporter, tumbled by the 10 percent daily limit to
6.41 yuan. The carmaker will recall 117,072 Tongyue model cars
starting March 30, the nation’s quality regulator  said  on its
website today, after China Central Television reported the
company sold vehicles with rusted chassis.  --Zhang Shidong. With assistance from Weiyi Lim in  Singapore .
