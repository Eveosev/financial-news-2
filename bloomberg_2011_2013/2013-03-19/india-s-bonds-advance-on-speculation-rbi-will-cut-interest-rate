India ’s bonds gained on speculation
the slowest economic growth in a decade will prompt the central
bank to cut borrowing costs for the second time this year.  The  Reserve Bank  of India will lower the repurchase  rate  by
25 basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 7.5 percent today,
according to 30 of 35 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
Five expect no change. The rate was cut by 25 basis points in
January, the first reduction in nine months.  “Investors have mostly factored in a reduction in rates
today as growth is a big concern,” said R.S. Chauhan, Mumbai-
based chief dealer of fixed-income and currencies at  State Bank 
of Bikaner & Jaipur. “Yields are unlikely to fall much in case
the rate is cut by 25 basis points.”  The yield on the 8.15 percent notes due June 2022 fell one
basis point to 7.88 percent as of 9:22 a.m. in Mumbai, according
to the central bank’s trading system.  Asia’s third-largest  economy  will expand 5 percent in the
fiscal year ending March 31, compared with 6.2 percent in the
prior 12 months, the  Central Statistical Office  said last month.
That would be the slowest pace since 2003.  India plans to raise 3.49 trillion rupees ($65 billion)
from debt sales in the six months ending Sept. 30, Economic
Affairs Secretary Arvind Mayaram said yesterday. The target for
the full fiscal year is 5.79 trillion rupees.  “The first half borrowing plan is in line with market
expectations,” said Chauhan.  The one-year  interest-rate  swap, a derivative contract used
to guard against fluctuations in funding costs, rose one basis
point to 7.51 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
