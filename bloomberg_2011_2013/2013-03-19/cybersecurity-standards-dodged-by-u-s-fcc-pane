A U.S. advisory panel failed to
reach consensus on recommendations to telecommunications
companies and  Internet providers  on how to bolster their
computer systems against cyber attack.  The practices examined by the Federal Communications
Commission panel ranged from recommending companies take
inventories of acceptable devices and software to urging that
they use automated tools to continually scan computers and
networks for malicious software.  The  list , described in a report dated March 6 posted on the
FCCâ€™s website, was developed in a private-public partnership
between the National Security Agency and security experts from
the Center for Internet Security and the SANS Institute. The
panel included representatives from US Telecom, a trade group,
and its members  AT&T Inc. (T) , Verizon Communications Inc. and
CenturyLink Inc. Other companies represented included Microsoft
Corp., Comcast Corp. and Cox Communications Inc.  The report was released after an executive order on
cybersecurity issued by President  Barack Obama  in February,
ordering a framework for cybersecurity to be developed for
critical industry sectors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
