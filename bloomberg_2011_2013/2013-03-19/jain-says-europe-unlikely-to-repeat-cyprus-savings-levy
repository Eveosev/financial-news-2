European Union leaders probably
won’t repeat a tax on deposits planned for Cypriot banks, said
 Deutsche Bank AG (DBK)  co-Chief Executive Officer Anshu Jain.  “We see near-term contagion risk as limited and it is
unlikely to be a model for other EU states,” he said in a
speech at a conference in  Frankfurt  today. “As a precedent, it
does widen the scope for bail-ins in a way which could
negatively affect investor sentiment if another peripheral
country were to get into difficulty.”  The EU announced the unprecedented tax three days ago as
part of a bailout of the Mediterranean island, wracked by the
debt crisis and losses made by Cypriot banks on Greek debt. The
decision sent financial stocks including Deutsche Bank tumbling
on concern it may reignite the sovereign debt crisis or hurt
banks’ credit ratings.  Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday that the levy,
which the Parliament in Nicosia is due to consider today, may
hurt the confidence of European savers and limits support for
bank creditors in the region.  Jain said the chances of a “dramatic event” in  Europe 
have receded, though growth is going to be slow for a long time.  To contact the reporters on this story:
