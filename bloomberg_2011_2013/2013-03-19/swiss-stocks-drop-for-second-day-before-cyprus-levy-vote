Swiss stocks  retreated the most in
three weeks as Cypriot lawmakers continued to wrangle over a
bank-deposit levy, outweighing a report that showed housing
starts in the U.S. exceeded economists’ forecasts.  Cie. Financiere Richemont SA, the owner of the Cartier
brand, dropped the most in eight weeks. Baloise Holding AG, the
150-year-old insurer, declined.  Partners Group Holding AG (PGHN) 
climbed to the highest price since its initial public offering
in 2006 after posting full-year profit that rose 27 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI)  slipped 0.5 percent to 7,789.6 at
the close of trading in Zurich, after earlier advancing as much
as 0.2 percent. The equity benchmark last week climbed to its
highest level since January 2008, as reports pointed to a
strengthening global economy amid ongoing speculation that
central banks will maintain stimulus. The broader Swiss
Performance Index lost 0.6 percent today.  “The Cypriot situation is causing uncertainty on the
markets, but we’re not seeing dramatic losses and investors may
just see it as a good opportunity to take profits,” said John Plassard, vice president at Mirabaud Securities LLP in Geneva,
which oversees about $28 billion. “In all likelihood, the
Eurogroup will relax its requirement in terms of tax on bank
deposits and calm should gradually return to the markets.”  Cypriot lawmakers began debating how to spread the proposed
charge on bank deposits among account holders. The levy,
announced on March 16, sparked concern among investors by
breaking the taboo against raiding bank accounts. Cyprus’s banks
will remain closed today and tomorrow.  Bank Levy  Parliament will probably reject the proposals, Cyprus
President Nicos Anastasiades told  Sweden ’s TV4 channel in an
interview today. The legislature may not vote on the levy today,
according to Defense Minister Fotis Fotiou.  The euro area’s  finance ministers  said that Cyprus could
extract more of the levy from the largest depositors. The
original plan had set a 6.75 percent charge on deposits under
100,000 euros ($128,000) and 9.9 percent on larger sums.  In the U.S., a Commerce Department report showed that
builders  broke ground  on 917,000 properties at an annual rate,
up 0.8 percent from a 910,000 pace in January that was higher
than initially estimated.  Building permits , a proxy for future
construction, increased to 946,000, the most since June 2008.  Richemont fell 4.3 percent to 76.10 Swiss francs, the worst
performance on  the SMI , as a shareholder sold about 7 million
shares for 539 million francs ($569 million). Goldman Sachs
Group Inc. placed the stake at 77 francs apiece, according to
two people familiar with the transaction.  Swatch Group AG, the largest maker of Swiss watches,
declined 3.4 percent to 531.50 francs.  Baloise, Kaba  Baloise (BALN)  slipped 1.1 percent to 89.70 francs after lowering
its target for return on equity. Switzerland’s third-biggest
insurer reduced its return-on-equity target to a range of 8
percent to 12 percent from a previous goal of 15 percent because
of declining interest rates.  Kaba Holding AG (KABN)  retreated 3.2 percent to 358.50 francs
after UBS AG cut the stock to neutral from buy, saying that the
company has lost market share.  “We struggle with the company’s top-line development,”
Torsten Wyss, an analyst at UBS AG, wrote in a report today.
“We don’t believe Kaba will be able to meet its full-year
2012-13 and 2013-14 sales growth targets.”  Clariant AG (CLN)  slid 1.7 percent to 14.08 francs, the biggest
decline on a gauge of European chemical makers. Syngenta AG, the
world’s largest agrochemical company, slipped 1.3 percent to
402.90 francs.  Partners Group rallied 4.4 percent to 233.30 francs. The
Swiss asset manager said net income increased to 257 million
francs in 2012, from 202 million francs in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
