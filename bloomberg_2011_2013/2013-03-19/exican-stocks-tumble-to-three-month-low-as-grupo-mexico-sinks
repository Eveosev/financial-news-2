Mexico’s benchmark  IPC stock index 
fell to the lowest in three months as the country’s biggest
mining company followed copper prices lower.  The index sank 1.3 percent to 42,060.61, the lowest level
since Nov. 30. Homebuilders declined for an eighth-straight day,
sending an index of builders to a record, while  Grupo Mexico 
SAB’s drop contributed the most to the gauge’s fall.  Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB) , Mexico’s biggest mining company by market
value, fell 3.6 percent to 49.71 pesos, as copper prices
declined to the lowest in almost seven months on speculation
European debt turmoil will damp growth and erode demand.  “The whole sector has been affected by lower prices,”
Rodrigo Garcilazo, an analyst with Corporativo GBM SAB in Mexico
City, said in a telephone interview.  Grupo Financiero Banorte SAB (GFNORTEO)  fell 3 percent to 95.67 pesos,
while  Fomento Economico Mexicano SAB (FEMSAUBD)  fell 2.1 percent to 136.25
pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
