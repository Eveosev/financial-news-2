Saudi Arabia  is rushing through 1.6
billion riyals ($427 million) of projects starting next month to
improve water sources including drilling 43 wells and building
27 desalination plants, the Arab News said, citing Riyadh
Governor Prince Khaled bin Bandar.  The projects will add 200,000 cubic meters (7 million cubic
feet) of water a day for Riyadh, whose population reached 5.2
million last year,  Arab News  said. The National Water Company,
which hopes to fill a gap in water needs in Riyadh, also
announced it cut the implementation time for the projects from
18 months to six months to meet the regionâ€™s water demands.  The water projects will also include tanks and pumps, with
the NWC saying purification plants are being readied for
operations shortly before the start of summer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
