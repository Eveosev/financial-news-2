The New York Giants agreed on a
contract with quarterback David Carr, who will be the backup to
starter Eli Manning for the third straight season,  ESPN
reported , citing an unidentified person familiar with the
situation.  Carr, 33, attempted only three passes over the past two
National Football League seasons behind Manning, who has started
135 straight regular-season games for the Giants dating to 2004.  Carr was the first pick in the 2002 NFL draft and spent his
first five seasons with the Houston Texans, where he completed
60 percent of his passes for 13,391 yards, 59 touchdowns and 65
interceptions. Carr joined the Giants as a backup to Manning in
2008 and 2009, then spent one season with the San Francisco
49ers before returning to New York.  Manning, 32, was the top pick in the 2004 draft and has a
78-57 regular-season record as a starter, while leading the
Giants to two Super Bowl titles. The Giants now have Manning,
Carr and Curtis Painter on the roster at quarterback.  To contact the reporter on this story:
