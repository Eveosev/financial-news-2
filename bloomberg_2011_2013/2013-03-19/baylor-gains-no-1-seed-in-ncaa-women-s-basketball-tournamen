Baylor University  claimed the top
overall seed for the National Collegiate Athletic Association
women’s basketball tournament, where the Bears will seek to
become the fourth school to win back-to-back titles.  Baylor, led by 6-foot-8 (2.03 meter) senior  Brittney Griner 
and Hall of Fame coach Kim Mulkey, had a 32-1 record this season
and enters the NCAA tournament with a 30-game winning streak.
The Bears’ lone loss came against Stanford University at a
November tournament in  Hawaii  and they topped the national
rankings the final 11 weeks of the regular season.  “Just winning is motivation enough,” Griner said in a
televised interview. “Everybody on this team, we’re competitors
and we just have to go out and do what we need to do to get this
win.”  Griner is the second-leading scorer in women’s college
basketball history with 3,203 points. Jackie Stiles scored 3,393
at Missouri State from 1998-01.  The University of Notre Dame, University of  Connecticut  and
Stanford also received No. 1 regional seeds in the 64-team
women’s tournament, which begins March 23. The championship game
is scheduled for April 9 in New Orleans.  This is the second straight year that Baylor, Notre Dame,
Connecticut and Stanford were selected as No. 1 seeds. All of
them advanced to the Final Four last year.  Baylor captured its second national title last season with
an 80-61 rout of Notre Dame that capped a 40-0 season. The Bears
last year became the first team -- men or women -- to win 40
games in a season.  The only schools to repeat as women’s champions are
Connecticut (2002-04, 2009-10),  Tennessee  (1996-98, 2007-08) and
the University of Southern California (1983-84).  ‘Nothing Different’  “Nothing is really different this year,” said Griner, who
averaged 23.6 points and nine rebounds a game for the Bears.
“Our main goal is to go out, win these six games and get a
national championship. That’s what we’re doing.”  The NCAA women’s champion has been a No. 1 or No. 2
regional seed for the past 15 years.  Baylor sits atop the Oklahoma City region and will play
16th-seeded Prairie View A&M (17-14) in its first-round game on
March 24. Baylor’s regional also includes No. 2 Tennessee, No. 3
the University of California, Los Angeles, and fourth-seeded
Purdue, while the Bears could meet Ivy League champion Princeton
University, the ninth seed, in the second round.  Stanford is the top seed in the Spokane region, which also
features No. 2  California , No. 3 Penn State and No. 4  Georgia ,
and opens play against Tulsa on March 24. Stanford had its 81-
game Pac-12 winning streak halted in January by California, its
potential opponent in the regional final.  Connecticut is No. 1 in the Bridgeport region and opens
play on March 23 against  Idaho . The other top teams in UConn’s
group are No. 2 Kentucky, No. 3 North Carolina and No. 4
 Maryland .  Notre Dame’s top competition in the Norfolk region is
second-seeded Duke, No. 3 Texas A&M and No. 4 South Carolina.
The Fighting Irish open on March 24 against the University of
Tennessee at Martin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
