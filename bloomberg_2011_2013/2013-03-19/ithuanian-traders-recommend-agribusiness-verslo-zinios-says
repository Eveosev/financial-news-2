Lithuanian equity traders predict
shares of local agriculture-related companies will rise in the
next six months, according to a survey by Verslo Zinios.  Of 20 brokers and fund managers asked on March 13-14 to
make recommendations for a six-month investment horizon, the
largest number, 17, suggested buying shares of  Linas Agro AB (LNA1L) , an
agribusiness holding company, the Vilnius-based newspaper
reported today.  Lender  Siauliu Bankas AB (SAB1L)  was second in the survey, with 15
’buy’ recommendations, followed by 10 ’buy’ ratings each for
clothing retailer  Apranga AB (APG1L)  and dairy companies  Rokiskio Suris
AB (RSU1L)  and  Zemaitijos Pienas AB (ZMP1L) , Verslo Zinios said.  A majority of the traders recommended holding shares of
energy-terminal operator  Klaipedos Nafta AB (KNF1L)  and furniture maker
 Vilniaus Baldai AB (VBL1L) , and selling the shipping company  Lietuvos
Juru Laivininkyste AB (LJL1L)  as well as  Dvarcioniu Keramika AB (DKR1L) , a
producer of ceramic tiles, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
