Cash premiums for corn shipped in
June to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago
futures as demand for U.S. exports rebounded after prices
slumped. Soybean premiums fell.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 61 cents to 62 cents a bushel above July futures, up
from 58 cents to 61 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show. The soybean basis declined to 73 cents to
76 cents a bushel from 73 cents to 80 cents yesterday.  Corn futures for July delivery dropped 10.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $6.70 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade. The
price fell 4.3 percent this week after tumbling 11 percent last
week as warm, wet weather improved prospects for U.S. crops.  “The drop in prices is attracting improved demand for
corn,” said  Dave Marshall , a farm-marketing adviser at Toay
Commodity Futures Group LLC in Nashville,  Illinois . “Soybean
supplies are more plentiful than corn as it appears people have
what they need” as record crops in  South America  reduce U.S.
exports, he said.  Soybean futures for July delivery gained 2.5 cents, or 0.2
percent, to $13.2025 a bushel. This week, the contract dropped 1
percent, the third straight decline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
