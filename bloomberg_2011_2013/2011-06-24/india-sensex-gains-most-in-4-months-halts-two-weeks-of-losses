India ’s benchmark stock index
rallied the most in four month, halting two weeks of losses,
after a slump in oil eased concerns that higher energy costs may
lead to further monetary tightening.  Oil & Natural Gas Corp., the nation’s largest state-owned
oil explorer, surged the most in a month.  DLF Ltd. (DLFU) , the biggest
developer, climbed for the first time this week.  State Bank of
India (SBIN) , the biggest lender, advanced the most since August 12.
Crude dropped 4.6 percent to $91.02 a barrel yesterday and
European leaders voiced support for Greece. Indian ministers
meet today to set fuel prices as they seek to trim subsidies
that threaten to top a forecast $5.3 billion.  “Stocks are seeing some short-covering as chances of the
 Greece  crisis spreading to rest of Europe have diminished,”
said B Gopkumar, executive vice president at Kotak Securities
Ltd. in Mumbai. “Stock valuations are looking much better than
before” after the recent declines.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
506.53, or 2.9 percent, to 18,234.02, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The measure climbed 2
percent this week, ending two weeks of losses. The S&P CNX Nifty
Index on the National Stock Exchange climbed 2.8 percent to
5,471.25 and its June futures settled at 5,484. The BSE 200
Index added 2.6 percent to 2,248.79.  Asian stocks rose today, with the region’s key index
snapping seven straight weeks of declines. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Index gained 1.4 percent to 132.47, rising 2.2 percent for the
week. European stocks rebounded from a three-month low, with the
Stoxx  Europe  600 Index gaining 1.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
