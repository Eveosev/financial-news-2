Zimbabwean police have arrested
Jameson Timba, a minister of state and a senior aide to Prime
Minister  Morgan Tsvangirai , Nelson Chamisa, a minister in
Tsvangirai’s Movement for Democratic Change party, said today.  Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said he had no details of
the arrest when Bloomberg News called seeking information.
Chamisa told Bloomberg that Timba was taken soon after he and
Tsvangirai returned from an official trip to  Spain .  “It’s unclear what the charges are at this stage, but it
may be connected to Jameson Timba correcting Mugabe’s statement
after the recent SADC comment,” Chamisa, also a Movement for
Democratic Change minister, said in a telephone interview from
Harare today.  Timba accused Mugabe of lying after a Southern African
Development Community summit on June 13, leading to calls for
his arrest from members of President  Robert Mugabe ’s Zimbabwe
African National Union-Patriotic Front.  To contact the reporter on this story:
