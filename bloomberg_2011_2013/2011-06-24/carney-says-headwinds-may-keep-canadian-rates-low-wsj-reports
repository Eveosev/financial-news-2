Bank of Canada Governor  Mark Carney 
sees “substantial headwinds” for the country’s economy and
 monetary policy  may need to remain stimulative for the central
bank to reach its inflation goal, the Wall Street Journal
reported today, citing an interview.  Canada is in “an environment of substantial headwinds,”
the newspaper reported Carney as saying. “Monetary policy may
still need to be stimulative in order to close the output gap
and in order to get inflation back to target.”  Carney said the central bank sees “persistent strength of
the Canadian dollar,” the newspaper reported. He also said “we
see the headwinds both in our export performance and in the
inflation data.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
