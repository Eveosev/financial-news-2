Vietnam ’s one-year bond yield fell
after inflation slowed in May from a month earlier. The dong
strengthened.  Consumer prices rose 1.09 percent from May, when they
gained 2.21 percent, according to data released by the General
Statistics Office in Hanoi today. Prices climbed 20.82 percent
from a year earlier, the most since November 2008.  “Month-on-month inflation has fallen sharply so I
anticipate bond yields will go down,” said Tong Minh Tuan,
deputy head of research at Hanoi-based BIDV Securities Co., a
unit of Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam. “The
year-on-year inflation rate is expected to peak in August, then
drop.”  The yield on the one-year note declined six basis points,
or 0.06 percentage point, to 12.65 percent, according to a daily
fixing from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  The dong climbed 0.2 percent to 20,575 per dollar as of
4:10 p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
central bank fixed the reference rate at 20,618 today, unchanged
since June 13, according to its website. The currency is allowed
to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the rate.  --Diep Ngoc Pham in Hanoi. Editors: Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News staff on this story:
