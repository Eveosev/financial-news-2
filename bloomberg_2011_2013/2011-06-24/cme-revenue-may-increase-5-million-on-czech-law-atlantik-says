Central European Media Enterprises
Ltd. (CETV) , known as CME, may boost revenue by about $5 million a year
should lawmakers approve a plan to restrict advertising on Czech
public television, according to Atlantik FT.  The draft bill, now in parliament, would shift about $10
million of ads to the company part-owned by  Time Warner Inc. (TWX) ,
the Prague brokerage wrote in a report to clients today. The
broadcaster would have to pay 2 percent of its ad revenue, or
about $5 million, into a government-run fund for the advancement
of Czech cinematography, according to Atlantik.  “We would consider the adoption of the law moderately
positive news” for CME, analysts led by Milan Vanicek wrote in
the Atlantik report.  The bill is awaiting a final vote in the lower house of
parliament after passing the second reading, CTK reported on
June 21. CME shares gained 3.1 percent that day.  The stock increased 0.3 percent today to 334.7 koruna at
4:26 p.m. in  Prague , recovering some of yesterday’s 2.7 percent
drop. CME has gained 2 percent this week, its biggest rally
since the five days ended May 6.  On Nasdaq, its home market, CME fell 2.3 percent to $19.29
as of 10:26 a.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
