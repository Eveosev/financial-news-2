Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
first day in three as oil and corn importers bought dollars to
pay for goods.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 1.3 percent to 91.25 per dollar and was trading 0.7
percent down at 90.65 by 2 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, from
yesterday’s close of 90.05.  “The weakening is due to persisting high dollar demand by
oil and corn importers,” Julius Kiriinya, a dealer at Nairobi-
based African Banking Corp., said in a phone interview.  Kenya’s shilling, which reached a 17-year low on June 22,
has depreciated 11 percent against the dollar this year, ranking
it the world’s third-worst performing currency after Suriname’s
dollar and Maldives’ rufiyaa. The East African nation is
grappling with 13 percent  inflation , up from 3.2 percent in
October, as the price of corn, the nation’s staple food, soared
33 percent in the period.  Kenyan Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  said there is no
reason to “panic” over the shilling’s recent depreciation and
the country has “adequate” foreign-exchange reserves, he told
reporters today in Nairobi, the capital.  The nation’s central bank will “consider further
tightening of monetary policy to tame future inflation, and
stabilize the  exchange rate ,” Governor Njuguna Ndung’u told
reporters yesterday in Nairobi.
