The National Hockey League team in
Winnipeg will be nicknamed the Jets, according to a  report  in
the  Canadian Press , citing multiple league sources.  True North Sports & Entertainment purchased the  Atlanta
Thrashers  and moved the team to Manitoba.  The name Jets originally was given to the city’s World
Hockey Association team in 1972 and continued during its NHL
years. Once that franchise was moved to Phoenix, the NHL took
control of the name and trademarks.  The Jets played in the NHL from 1979-1996, recording 506
wins, 660 losses and 172 ties. In that span the team qualified
for the playoffs 11 times, never making it to the Stanley Cup
Final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
