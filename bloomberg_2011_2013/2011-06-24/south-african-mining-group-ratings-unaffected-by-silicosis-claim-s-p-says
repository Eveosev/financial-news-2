South African mining companies’
credit ratings aren’t immediately affected by a court ruling in
the country to allow a compensation claim by a silicosis
sufferer against  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) ,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  It’s too soon to assess the threat to mining companies of
similar claims, the rating company said in a statement today.  The National Union of Mineworkers, the industry’s largest
labor union, estimates that almost 5,400 miners in  South Africa 
died between 2003 and 2009 from respiratory illnesses, including
silicosis, according to the statement.  “The case outlined above might therefore expose the entire
mining industry in South Africa to similar claims,” S&P said,
adding that it will continue to monitor the AngloGold case.  The claimant will need to prove the producer’s negligence
and directly link that to his sickness, as well as justifying
the 2.6 million rand ($378,000) in damages demanded, S&P said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
