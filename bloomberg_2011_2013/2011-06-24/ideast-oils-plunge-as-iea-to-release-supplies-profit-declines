Middle East oils for sale to  Asia 
dropped against their benchmarks to their lowest in about two
years on concerns of oversupply as consuming countries plan to
release stockpiles and declining processing profits.  Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.’s Lower Zakum for August loading
dropped 21 cents to 69 cents a barrel below its official selling,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the biggest gap
since August 2009. Qatar Land fell 9 cents to 59 cents below its
official level, the largest discount since August 2009,
Bloomberg data showed.  The  International Energy Agency , an adviser to 28 oil-
consuming nations, agreed yesterday to release 60 million
barrels of light, low-sulfur crude from their emergency
stockpiles.  Japan  and  South Korea  said today they release crude
and oil products.  Refiners in Asia are also facing slumping refinery margins
amid a decline in demand for fuels. Gasoil’s premium to Dubai
crude, a measure of profitability, dropped $1.64 to $16.65 a
barrel, the lowest since February, according to data from
London-based brokers PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  Oman crude for immediate loading slipped $1.68, or 1.6
percent, to $104.34 barrel, Bloomberg data show. Dubai oil for
delivery in August fell 1.6 percent to $103.82. Murban decreased
1.5 percent to $108.39.  Oman futures for August delivery climbed 96 cents to
$103.41 a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:05 p.m.
Singapore time, with 632 contracts traded. The settlement price
was at $103.09 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  The August Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps, which measures
the European marker versus the Persian Gulf grade, narrowed $1
cents to $4.25 a barrel, according to data from PVM. The
