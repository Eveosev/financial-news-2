Charles Evans , president of the
Federal  Reserve Bank  of Chicago, said U.S. states face a
“serious challenge” following the 18-month recession that
ended in June 2009 and have been “slow to recognize”
fundamental problems that may exist in their budget structures.  Rising state and local debt levels are “creating some
concern about municipal-bond ratings and future debt issuance,”
Evans said in welcome remarks at a conference held at the
district bank today. “Given these fiscal pressures, the
managing of state and local budgets has become an increasingly
difficult business,” said the 53-year-old president, who votes
on the  Federal Open Market Committee  this year. He didn’t
discuss the economy or monetary policy.  U.S. states are recovering from revenue shortfalls that
totaled more than $430 billion from fiscal 2009 to 2011,
according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in
 Washington . At least 42 states and the District of Columbia
project $103 billion in budget gaps for fiscal 2012, which for
most states begins July 1, the center said in a report this
month.  “Recently, we have seen that state budget concerns can
weigh on economic activity,” Evans said at the conference on
state budgets under stress. “States now face a serious
challenge in the recession and its aftermath,” with bases of
revenue contracting faster than in previous years, he said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
