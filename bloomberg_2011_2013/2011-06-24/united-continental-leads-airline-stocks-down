United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) 
fell the most in four months in New York trading, leading other
airlines lower, after reporting that revenue growth slowed this
quarter.  The Bloomberg U.S. Airlines Index of 11 carriers tumbled
4 percent, as the  Standard & Poor’s 500  and the Dow Jones
Industrial Average each declined about 1 percent.  United’s revenue for each seat flown a mile in June rose
about 3 percent to 4 percent, data released by the airline after
the close of markets yesterday showed. The growth slowed from as
much as 15 percent in May,  Dan McKenzie , a Rodman & Renshaw
analyst, said in a report today. Second-quarter unit revenue
will be up an estimated 9.3 percent, Chicago-based United said.  “Revenue growth has slowed, but the extent of the slowdown
is still hard to measure,” Kevin Crissey, an analyst at UBS AG,
said in a note to investors today.  McKenzie cut his second-quarter United earnings estimate to
$1.45 a share from $1.95, while Crissey trimmed his to $1.37
from $1.62 and Gary Chase at Barclays Capital revised his to
$1.38 from $1.96.  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American Airlines said today that its second-
quarter revenue from each seat flown a mile probably increased
4 percent to 5 percent in its main jet operations, and as much
as 5.5 percent including the American Eagle regional unit.  Revenue was reduced by about $60 million by a spring
hailstorm at American’s Dallas-Fort Worth hub that damaged
planes and reduced traffic following the March earthquake and
tsunami in Japan, AMR said.  United fell $2.15, or 8.6 percent, to $22.99 at 4:15 p.m.
in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, its biggest one-
day slide since Feb. 22.  Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  tumbled 51 cents, or 5.1 percent, to
$9.43; AMR fell 41 cents, or 6.8 percent, to $5.64;  US Airways
Group Inc. (LCC)  declined 22 cents, or 2.5 percent, to $8.69; and
 Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV)  dropped 5 cents to $11.36.  To contact the reporter on this story:
