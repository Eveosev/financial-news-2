Swaziland is facing a corn shortage
of as much as 29,000 metric tons, the  Swaziland Observer 
reported, citing Robert Thwala, principal secretary at the
Ministry of Agriculture.  The southern African nation’s current reserves of 84,686
tons of the staple food aren’t enough to meet expected local
demand, the Mbabane-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
