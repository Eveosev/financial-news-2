High demand for tickets to the 2012
 London  Olympics caused problems for the online ordering system
this morning as a second round of sales began.  About 2.3 million tickets went on sale at 6 a.m. London
time and fans who logged on were met with a slowdown to the
system. London Olympics organizers said the process is now
flowing normally.  “Please just remain patient and we will process your
request as soon as we can,” an  update  on the organizing
committee’s website said.  Tickets are available until July 3 to those who didn’t get
tickets in the first sales phase earlier this year. Tickets will
then be made available from July 8-17 for applicants who were
successful in that first round.  To contact the reporter on this story:
