European stocks fell, completing the
longest streak of weekly losses since 1998, as a drop in banking
shares amid concern the region’s debt crisis will worsen
overshadowed a rebound in mining shares and carmakers.  Italian lenders tumbled as  Unione di Banche Italiane ScpA (UBI) 
fell below its rights offer price.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO)  and  Xstrata
Plc (XTA)  advanced more than 2 percent as copper rallied. Porsche SE
rose 2.4 percent as BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research
reiterated its “buy” recommendation.  The benchmark Stoxx Europe 600 Index slipped 0.1 percent to
263.98 at the 4:30 p.m. close in  London , extending a three-month
low. The measure has fallen for eighth straight weeks as U.S.
economic data trailed forecasts and concern mounted that  Greece 
will default on its debt. The decline has dragged its valuation
to the cheapest since 2008 compared with reported earnings, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The market is still waiting for Greece’s austerity
measures next week and nobody is willing to heavily invest in
equities right now,” said  Robert Halver , head of research at
Baader Bank AG in  Frankfurt . “Greece is the first nail in
coffin of the euro land.”  National benchmark indexes declined in 9 of the 16 western
European markets open today.  Germany ’s DAX Index slipped 0.4
percent while the U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained 0.4 percent.
Sweden and Finland were closed for public holidays.  Greek Pledge  In Greece, the benchmark ASE Index slid 0.7 percent even as
European Union officials vowed to stave off a default as long as
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  pushes through a package of
budget cuts next week. Greek lawmakers are due to vote on 78
billion euros ($111 billion) of austerity measures on June 30.  The Stoxx 600 rose as much as 1.2 percent earlier as
business confidence in Germany,  Europe ’s largest economy,
unexpectedly improved. The Ifo institute in Munich said its
business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives,
increased to 114.5 in June from 114.2 in May.  In the U.S., a report showed orders for durable goods
climbed 1.9 percent in May after slumping 2.7 percent in April,
easing concern that manufacturing will share in an extended U.S.
slowdown. That beat the average economist forecast. Separate
figures showed the  U.S. economy  grew at a 1.9 percent pace in
the first quarter.  Italian Banks  UBI sparked a selloff in Italian banks after the country’s
fourth-biggest lender fell below the price at which it’s selling
shares in a 1 billion-euro rights offer. The stock dropped 0.9
percent to 3.78 euros after earlier falling as much as 5
percent. UBI has been offering investors 8 new shares at 3.808
euros apiece for every 21 they hold.  UniCredit SpA (UCG) , the only Italian bank facing stress tests
that hasn’t announced plans to sell new shares, lost 5.5 percent
to 1.36 euros.  Intesa Sanpaolo SpA (ISP) ,  Italy ’s second-biggest
lender by assets, fell 4.3 percent to 1.71 euros.  Moody’s Investors Service said yesterday it may downgrade
13 Italian banks because they would be vulnerable were the
government’s credit rating to be cut. The ratings company last
week warned that it may trim Italy’s credit ratings because of
slowing economic growth and the potential for the sovereign
crisis to drive the country’s borrowing costs higher.  Banking shares posted the second-worst performance among 19
industry groups in the Stoxx 600, falling 1.6 percent.  BNP
Paribas (BNP)  SA,  France ’s biggest bank, slid 2.1 percent to 50.19
euros, while  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , the largest bank in Germany, fell
1.4 percent to 39.47 euros.  Allianz SE and Axa SA, Europe’s biggest insurers, fell 2.3
percent to 91.87 euros and 2.5 percent to 14.52 euros,
respectively.  Mining Companies  Antofagasta rallied 2.3 percent to 1,266 pence and Xstrata
climbed 2.2 percent to 1,271 pence.  Copper rebounded today as investors resumed their bullish
outlook for demand. Premier  Wen Jiabao  said in an opinion piece
in the Financial Times that  China ’s efforts to stem inflation
have worked and that the pace of consumer-price increases will
slow. China is the world’s largest consumer of copper.  Porsche paced gains in carmakers, climbing 2.4 percent to
52.77 euros after BofA Merrill Lynch reiterated its “buy”
recommendation and price estimate of 75 euros for the shares.
Analysts said the company, which is looking to merge with
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , is a “cheap way to play” Europe’s largest
carmaker.  VW rallied 2.2 percent to 134.85 euros.  Bayerische Motoren
Werke AG (BMW)  climbed 2.9 percent to 67.13 euros, the highest since
1992, as Manager Magazin said the maker of luxury cars is aiming
to increase deliveries to 2 million automobiles by 2016 and to
2.5 million to 2.6 million vehicles by 2020. The magazine cited
people close to BMW.  Berkeley Rallies  Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG)  surged 11 percent to 1,254
pence, the highest price since January 2008, after the U.K.’s
largest homebuilder by market value announced a plan to pay
shareholders about 1.7 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) in
dividends over the next 10 years. The company also reported a 21
percent jump in full-year revenue and a 19 percent increase in
net income.  Cap Gemini SA (CAP) , Europe’s largest computer-services company,
climbed 3.8 percent to 38.75 euros after  Accenture Plc (ACN) , the
world’s second-biggest technology-consulting company, raised its
full-year revenue and earnings forecasts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
