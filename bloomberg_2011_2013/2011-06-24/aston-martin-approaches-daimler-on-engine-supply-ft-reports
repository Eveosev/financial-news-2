Aston Martin , the Kuwaiti-owned
U.K.-based carmaker, has approached  Daimler AG (DAI)  and other German
carmakers about cooperating on engines and other technology,
including safety technology, as it seeks to lessen its
dependence on  Ford Motor Co. (F) , the Financial Times reported,
citing two people close to the company. Ford, which owned Aston
Martin until 2007, makes engines for Aston Martin at its plant
in Cologne under a deal that runs out in 2013, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
