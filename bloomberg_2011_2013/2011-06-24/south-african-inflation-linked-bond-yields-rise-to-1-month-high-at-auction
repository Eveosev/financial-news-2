South African inflation-linked bond
yields rose to the highest in more than a month at an auction
after the central bank said it had seen no evidence that higher
food and fuel prices were driving inflation generally.  The  Reserve Bank  auctioned 600 million rand ($87 million)
of inflation-linked securities, including 220 million rand of
2.6 percent notes maturing in 2028 at an average yield of 2.61
percent, seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point higher
than at the previous sale on June 17 and the strongest since May
11. Investors bid for 1.4 times the amount allocated.  Inflation expectations as measured by the Stellenbosch-
based Bureau for Economic Research Inflation are “anchored well
within” the Reserve Bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent target range,
Chief Economist  Monde Mnyande  said yesterday. Consumer inflation
accelerated to 4.6 percent last month, the fastest pace in 12
months, from 4.2 percent in April as fuel costs rose, the
statistics agency said on June 22.  “The absence of second-round effects in the inflation data
and the increasingly uncertain global outlook” would likely
prompt the central bank to leave  interest rates  on hold this
year, Standard Bank Group Ltd. analysts led by Johannesburg-
based Shireen Darmalingam said in a research note.  The 10-year breakeven rate, or yield difference between
fixed-rate bonds maturing in 2021 and similar-maturity
inflation-linked notes, dropped three basis points to 5.82
percent today. The rate, which is in indicator of investors’
outlook for inflation, has declined from 6.22 percent reached on
March 8, the highest this year.  The central bank sold 60 million rand of 2.75 percent notes
due 2022 at an average yield of 2.55 percent and 320 million
rand of 3.45 percent bonds due 2033 at a yield of 2.55 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
