William Morrison Supermarkets Plc,
the smallest of the U.K.’s four main grocers, plans to add about
100 direct suppliers in  China  this year to eliminate middlemen.  The company opened its first China office in Hong Kong on
June 22 to “source better products,” the Bradford, England-
based retailer said in  a statement  on the Hong Kong government’s
website.  “The whole purpose of this office is to take out that
layer of cost in the supply chain,” Bob Guard, executive
director of the Hong Kong office, said by telephone today.  The company is starting from a small base of direct
suppliers in China, Guard said. He would not disclose William
Morrison’s current number of direct suppliers in China.  The supermarket operator buys non-food items including
toys, stationary, consumer electronics and houseware products
from Chinese suppliers for its 455 stores in the U.K., according
to the June 22 press release.  The  Hong Kong  office deals with China-based suppliers and
will eventually start working with those in other countries in
the region, Guard said, without giving a timeframe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
