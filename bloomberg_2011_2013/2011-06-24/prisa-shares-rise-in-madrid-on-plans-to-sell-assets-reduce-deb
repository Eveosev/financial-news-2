Promotora de Informaciones SA (PRS)  rose
the most in more than two months in Madrid trading after the
publisher of El Pais newspaper said it may sell assets and issue
more debt while the controlling shareholder exercises warrants
as part of a plan to reduce overall borrowings.  Prisa, as the Madrid-based company is known, may sell non-
strategic assets valued at more than 500 million euros ($709
million), Chief Executive Officer Juan Luis Cebrian said at the
company’s shareholders’ meeting today in Madrid, according to a
statement sent to regulators. The stock rose as much as 6.2
percent, the biggest intraday jump since April 13.  The Spanish media company may also issue other non-banking
debt instruments for as much as 500 million euros, depending on
market conditions, which will allow the company to extend its
obligations with lenders, Cebrian said in the statement. Prisa’s
controlling shareholder, which holds more than 30 percent of the
company, may exercise in the short term the 70 percent of the
warrants that it holds, Cebrian said.  “All these measures are in progress and some are already
very advanced,” Cebrian said. “It’s predictable that some
protocols and contracts will be signed shortly.”  Prisa traded 5.8 percent higher at 1.46 euros as of
4:59 p.m. The stock has dropped 4.3 percent this year, valuing
the company at 1.46 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
