German financial institutions have
so far not reached a decision on participating in a Greek rescue
by rolling over the country’s debt,  Boersen-Zeitung  reported
today, without saying where it obtained the information.  The banks and insurers, which met with central bank
representatives in  Frankfurt  on June 22, want a European Union
guarantee on the Greek debt they may prolong the maturities on,
the newspaper said. The German financial institutions will
submit proposals before Sunday evening on the potential amount
they are willing to roll over, Boersen-Zeitung reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
