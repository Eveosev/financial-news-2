Ukraine will harvest 1.62 million
metric tons of rapeseed, 10 percent more than a year earlier,
after boosting planting, Kiev-based researcher ProAgro said.  The country increased its rapeseed planting by 30 percent
from a year ago, ProAgro said in a report e-mailed late
yesterday. Unfavorable weather will probably cause yields to
fall to 1.64 tons a hectare (2.47 acres) from 1.7 tons last
year.  The sunflower seed harvest will probably decline to 7.29
million tons from 7.34 million tons in 2010, ProAgro said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
