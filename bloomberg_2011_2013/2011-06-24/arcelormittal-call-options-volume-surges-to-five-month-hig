ArcelorMittal (MT) ’s bullish options
volume rose to the highest level since January as investors
opened new positions to wager that the world’s largest
steelmaker will advance more than 9 percent by August.  Almost 25,000 calls to buy the shares changed hands as of
3:25 p.m. in New York, 4.1 times the four-week average, as the
Luxembourg-based company slumped 0.8 percent to $31.97. More
than half of all volume was concentrated in the August $35
calls, which climbed 26 percent. They had an open interest of
6,677 contracts before today and 84 percent of today’s trades
were at the ask price, which indicates that investors creating
new bullish positions initiated almost all of the transactions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
