Investors should buy  Hungary ’s 10-
year bonds as it move to implement plans to cut the biggest debt
burden among the European Union’s eastern members, Raiffeisen
Bank International AG said today.  Hungary’s bonds have returned as much as 20 percent this
year in dollar terms for the biggest gains worldwide, after
Prime Minister  Viktor Orban  in January followed last year’s
self-described “unorthodox” policies with a plan to cut
spending on welfare payments and drug subsidies.  “Considering the improved confidence towards Hungary
backed by the structural reform plans, our recommendation is to
buy the 10-year Hungarian government bond segment at the current
levels, targeting yields below 7 percent,” Matyas Kovacs and
Wolfgang Ernst, Raiffeisen analysts based in Budapest and
Vienna, respectively, wrote in a research report today.  Hungary’s government bonds maturing in June 2022 weakened
for a third day, lifting the yield 2 basis points or 0.02
percentage points, to 7.438 percent, the highest since March, as
of 1:52 p.m. in Budapest. The slump in the Hungarian notes and
the forint this week has been driven by concern  Greece ’s debt
crisis will spread to other indebted EU members, according to
the Raiffeisen analysts.  The forint depreciated less than 0.1 percent to 269.37 per
euro, extending its weekly slump to 0.4 percent, a third
straight week of losses.  To contact the reporter on this story:
