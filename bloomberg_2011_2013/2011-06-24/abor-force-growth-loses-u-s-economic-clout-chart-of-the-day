Anyone who sees the pace of U.S.
economic growth as subpar may be looking back too far in making
that judgment, according to James W. Paulsen, chief investment
strategist at Wells Capital Management in  Minneapolis .  “Comparisons of recoveries since 1985 to those of earlier
vintages seem inappropriate” because the country’s labor force
no longer expands as much as it did historically, Paulsen wrote
this week in a report.  The CHART OF THE DAY illustrates this by tracking the year-
to-year percentage changes in the number of civilians working or
job hunting, according to data compiled by the Labor Department.
Recession periods are shown in red.  During the past quarter century, the fastest growth rate
was 3.2 percent for the 12 months ended in April 2000. The pace
was exceeded 11 times between 1950 and 1985, as the chart shows.  “The inherent economic growth which used to be forthcoming
from a rapid expansion in the  labor force  has significantly
diminished,” Paulsen wrote. After accounting for this, the
current economic rebound looks similar to other post-1985
recoveries, in his view.  Since the economy began expanding two years ago, the labor
force has yet to achieve 1 percent growth. Even so, the rate of
change has risen as much as 5.3 percentage points from its post-
recession low. The increase surpassed those for the first five
years after the economy’s 1990-1991 and 2001 slumps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
