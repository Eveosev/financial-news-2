Hungarian retail sales fell the most
this year in April, underscoring the fragility of a revival of
domestic demand following years of austerity.  Sales dropped 1.3 percent from the year-earlier period, the
 statistics office  in Budapest said today in an e-mailed
statement. The median estimate of nine economists was for an
increase of 0.1 percent.  Retail sales dropped for 41 consecutive months through June
2010 as five years of austerity curtailed domestic demand.
Rising exports helped  Hungary â€™s economy grow 2.5 percent in the
first quarter from the same period last year, the fastest pace
in four years. The government targets growth of 3.2 percent this
year and as much as 5.2 percent by 2014.  To contact the reporter on this story:
