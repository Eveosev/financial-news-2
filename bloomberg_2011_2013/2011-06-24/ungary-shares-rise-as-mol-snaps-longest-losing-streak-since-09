Hungarian shares rose the most in
two weeks as Mol Nyrt. snapped its longest losing streak since
2009 and OTP Bank Nyrt. advanced on speculation European leaders
will provide aid to  Greece .  The benchmark BUX index jumped 1 percent to 22,526.74 at
10:27 a.m. in Budapest, the biggest intraday gain since June 7,
paring the week’s decline to 0.8 percent. Mol gained 1.9 percent
to 21,300 forint after 10 days of losses. OTP, the country’s
largest lender, added 1.1 percent to 5,790 forint.  European Union officials pledged yesterday to stabilize the
euro-area economy and provide aid to Greece as long as Prime
Minister  George Papandreou  pushes through a package of budget
cuts next week.  China ’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  said the nation’s
efforts to stem inflation have worked, an assessment that may be
supported by lower crude prices. U.S. data today will likely
show durable goods orders climbed.  “Buyers may get the upper hand on the back of the Chinese
and Greek news, and that may only be slightly affected by the
American economic data,” Akos Herczenik and Levente Blaho,
analysts at Raiffeisen Bank International AG in Budapest, wrote
in a note to clients today.  The forint strengthened 0.3 percent to 268.84 per euro,
paring weekly losses to 0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
