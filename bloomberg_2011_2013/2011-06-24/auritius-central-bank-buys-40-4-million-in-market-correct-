Mauritius’s central bank purchased
more foreign currency last week than at any time in the past
year to ensure stability in the market, Bank of Mauritius
Governor Rundheersing Bheenick said.  The Port Louis-based central bank bought $40.4 million,
4.43 million euros ($6.3 million) and 1 million pounds ($1.6
million), it said on its website on June 24.  “We are trying to mop up all excess forex that could
destabilize the domestic market and create unnecessary
volatility,” Bheenick said in a phone interview on June 24 from
Basel, Switzerland, where he was attending a meeting of the
Governing Board of the International Islamic Liquidity
Management Corp.  The rupee has weakened by 2.1 percent against the dollar
since June 1, paring its gains since the beginning of the year
to 7.5 percent, according to Bloomberg data. It was trading at
28.55 rupees at 10:58 a.m. in  Port Louis .  The Indian Ocean island nation, with a population of 1.28
million people, is a net importer of food and fuels.  Annual inflation accelerated to 7.1 percent in May from 7
percent in April, the  Central Statistics Office  said on June 7.
The central bank raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis
points, or quarter of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent on June
13 to rein in inflation running at its fastest pace in more than
two years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
