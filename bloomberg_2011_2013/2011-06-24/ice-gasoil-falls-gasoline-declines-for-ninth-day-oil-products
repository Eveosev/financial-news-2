BP Plc sold a 20,000-ton cargo of
diesel to Mabanaft BV, while Glencore International Plc sold
about half that volume of the same fuel to  ConocoPhillips. (COP)   Gasoil dropped on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London , extending yesterday’s plunge after the  International
Energy Agency ’s decision to release oil stockpiles.  Light Products  Gasoline for immediate loading fell for a ninth day on the
barge market, where traded lots are about 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Eurobob grade fuel traded from $941.50 to $945 a metric
ton, according to a Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers
monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board and the Platts pricing
window. That’s less than yesterday’s lowest deal of $949 for
Eurobob, to which ethanol is added before being sold to
motorists.  Middle Distillates  BP sold diesel to Mabanaft at a premium of $37 to the July
gasoil contract on ICE, the survey showed. Glencore sold its
cargo at a premium of $35 to the same contract, agreeing to
deliver the shipment to the German port of Bremen.  Gasoil for July delivery dropped $13.75, or 1.6 percent, to
$875.25 a ton on ICE as of 4:52 p.m. local time.  The contract closed down 4.1 percent yesterday, the biggest
daily drop since May 5, after the IEA members’ decision to
release strategic reserves.  Germany  will contribute both crude
and products, according to the  Economy Ministry .  Gasoil barges traded at a discounts of $1.50 and $3 to that
contract, little changed from yesterday, the survey showed.
Diesel barges were also little changed, with deals done at
premiums of $27 and $28 to the front-month gasoil contract.  Residues  Low-sulfur  fuel oil  traded from $638 to $640.25 a ton, the
survey showed. High-sulfur fuel oil traded from $593 to $597.50.  Low sulfur fuel oil is used to power ships and generate
electricity, while high sulfur fuel oil is only used in
shipping.  To contact the reporter on this story:
