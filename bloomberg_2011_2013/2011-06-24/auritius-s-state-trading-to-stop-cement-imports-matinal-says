Mauritius’s State Trading Corp. will
stop importing cement on July 1 as the state frees up the market
in the building material, Le Matinal reported, without saying
where it got the information.  The Indian Ocean island nation’s annual consumption is
650,000 metric tons, with two cement plants run by the local
unit of  Holcim Ltd. (HOLN)  and Lafarge Ltd., the Port Louis-based
newspaper said.  Three other companies are planning to enter the market;
Binani Cement Ltd., Oriental Group and Mauritius Chemical &
Fertilizers Industry Ltd., Le Matinal said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
