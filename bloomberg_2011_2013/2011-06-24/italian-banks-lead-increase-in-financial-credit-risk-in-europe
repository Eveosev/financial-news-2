Italian banks led an increase in the
cost of insuring European bonds amid concern the European debt
crisis may spread just as lenders face scrutiny from regulators
over capital levels.  Credit-default swaps on the senior debt of  Unione di Banche
Italiane SCPA (UBI)  jumped 48 basis points to 283, according to CMA.
Banca Popolare di Milano Scrl climbed 37 basis points to 295 and
 UniCredit SpA (UCG) , whose stock was briefly suspended after breaching
limits on intraday swings, rose 21 to 234.  Italian banks are being stress-tested by European
regulators next month to assess whether they have sufficient
capital. The European Banking Authority yesterday updated its
stress tests to take into account losses banks may face on their
holdings of debt from crisis-hit countries including  Greece .  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to senior debt of
25 banks and insurers increased 4 basis points to 176 and the
subordinated index rose 4 to 305, according to  JPMorgan Chase &
Co. (JPM)   The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments soared 5 basis points to a record 244. An increase
signals deterioration in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 5
basis points to 431. The gauge, which is headed for an eighth
weekly increase, is up from about 350 basis points at the
beginning of May.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 0.25 basis point to 115.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
