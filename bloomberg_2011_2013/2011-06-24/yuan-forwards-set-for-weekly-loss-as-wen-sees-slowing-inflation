Yuan forwards declined this week
after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said measures to cool inflation are
working, easing pressure on policy makers to allow a stronger
currency.  China’s efforts to curb prices have worked, Wen wrote in an
opinion piece in the Financial Times newspaper today. Commodity
prices reached a four-month low yesterday and have dropped 7.7
percent in June, according to the Standard & Poor’s GSCI index.
The  International Energy Agency  announced plans to release
emergency crude-oil supplies today, and U.S. jobless claims rose
more than forecast data showed yesterday.  “You can see commodity prices falling and in the second
half of the year, global inflation will come down,” said
Patrick Cheng, a Hong Kong-based foreign exchange analyst with
Haitong International Securities Co. “ China ’s yuan is not going
to be as strong as in the first half of this year.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards fell 0.23 percent
this week to 6.3919 per dollar as of 5:28 p.m. in Hong Kong,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The contract was at a
1.3 percent premium to the onshore spot rate.  China’s consumer prices rose 5.5 percent in May from a year
earlier, the most in 34 months.  The People’s Bank of China set
the yuan’s reference rate weaker for a second day, fixing it at
6.4742 per dollar. The yuan isn’t allowed to move more than 0.5
percent on either side of the daily fixing.  The yuan gained 0.02 percent this week to 6.4730 per dollar
as of the 4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to the China
Foreign Exchange Trade System. The currency fell 0.08 percent
today. In  Hong Kong ’s offshore market, the yuan dropped 0.02
percent for the week and today to 6.4690 per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
