China ’s stocks rallied the most in
four months on speculation the central bank will refrain from
raising  interest rates  after Premier  Wen Jiabao  said efforts to
stem inflation have worked.  A gauge of financial companies surged 2.9 percent as money-
market rates dropped for the first time in eight days. Citic
Securities Co. climbed 8.6 percent, leading gains for
brokerages.  Air China Ltd. (601111)  advanced the most in eight months
after oil slumped. SAIC Motor Corp. jumped to a two-month high
as the National Business Daily said government agencies are
seeking to remove limits on vehicle purchases.  “The premier’s remarks are special, giving investors
confidence that inflation may ease in the near future,” said Li Jun, a strategist at Central China Securities Co.  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, added 58 points, or 2.2 percent, to
2,746.21 at the 3 p.m. close, the biggest gain since Feb. 14. It
advanced 3.9 percent this week, the most since the five days
ended Nov. 5. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  rose 2.4 percent to 3,027.47.  The Shanghai gauge has slumped 10 percent from this year’s
high on April 18 on concern government measures to cool
inflation will slow economic growth. The central bank has raised
 reserve requirements  12 times and interest rates four times
since the start of last year. The  stock index  has lost 2.2
percent this year, dragging down average estimated price
earnings to 12.8 times from 15.9 times at the end of 2010.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
