Verbio Vereinigte BioEnergie AG, an
operator of two ethanol plants in  Germany , plans to increase
production as demand rises for the motor-fuel additive.  The company plans to run its ethanol plants in Schwedt and
Zoerbig at full capacity in the second half of the year, Frank
Struempfel, a Verbio spokesman, said by phone yesterday. That’s
up from about 50 percent in the second quarter.  Germany seeks to cut  carbon emissions  by adding biofuels
such as ethanol to motor fuel.  Oil companies  including Royal
Dutch Shell Plc started selling gasoline containing 10 percent
of ethanol this year in a bid to meet government targets. Demand
for the fuel, known as E10, was initially “sluggish,”
Struempfel said from Leipzig.  “Now we can see it’s improving,” he said.  Verbio’s Schwedt facility can produce 200,000 metric tons
of ethanol annually, while the Zoerbig plant has half that
capacity. The Schwedt oil refinery, whose shareholders including
BP Plc and Shell, was the first plant in Germany to start
production of E10 gasoline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
