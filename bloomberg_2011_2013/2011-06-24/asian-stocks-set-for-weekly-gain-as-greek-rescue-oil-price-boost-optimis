Asian stocks rose, with the region’s
key index snapping seven straight weeks of declines, amid
speculation  China  may not take further steps to cool its economy,
and on diminishing concern that Europe’s debt crisis will hurt
bank earnings.  Aluminum Corp. of China Ltd. gained 2.9 percent in  Hong
Kong . Mizuho Financial Group Inc.,  Japan ’s third-largest bank by
market value, rose 1.6 percent in  Tokyo  after European Union
leaders vowed to rescue  Greece  from default.  Sony Corp. (6758) , Japan’s
No. 1 exporter of consumer electronics, which receives more than
20 percent of sales from Europe, advanced 2.4 percent.  Qantas
Airways Ltd. (QAN) , Australia’s biggest airline, climbed 1.9 percent
in Sydney after oil prices slid 4.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday. Oil producer  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  sank 0.5 percent.  “The high oil price was a massive constraint on a fragile
recovery, so anything that takes the froth off the energy market
is positive for growth,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based
strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which has almost $100
billion under management. “With Greece, they’ve managed to kick
the can further down the road, but any progress in avoiding
contagion to the rest of  Europe  is going to be welcomed.”  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index gained 1.4 percent to 132.48
as of 7:26 p.m. in Tokyo, putting the gauge on course for a 2.2
percent weekly advance, the most since the period ended April 22.
More than three stocks rose for each that fell on the index,
which has dropped in the previous seven weeks. The index has
tumbled 5.9 percent from this year’s May 2 high amid mounting
concern about a slowing U.S. economy, Europe’s sovereign debt
crisis and China’s steps to curb inflation.  Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.2 percent, while
South Korea’s Kospi Index gained 1.7 percent. Hong Kong’s Hang
Seng Index advanced 1.9 percent.  Easing Concern  China’s Shanghai Composite Index surged 2.2 percent, the
most in four months, after China’s Premier Wen Jiabao said
efforts to stem inflation have worked, easing concern the
government will raise  interest rates .  Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average advanced 0.9 percent.
Foreign investors were net sellers of Japanese stocks last week,
offloading 142.8 billion yen ($1.7 billion) more shares than
they bought, the most since the week ended Aug. 27, according to
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  All 10 industry groups tracked by the Asia Pacific gauge,
advanced today, led by financial stocks.  Aluminum Corp. gained 2.9 percent to HK$6.43 in Hong Kong.
 BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP) , the world’s No. 1 mining company whose
biggest customer is China, climbed 0.7 percent to A$42.34.  ‘Targeted Policies’  “There is concern as to whether China can rein in
inflation and sustain its rapid development -- my answer is an
emphatic yes,” Wen wrote in an opinion piece in the Financial
Times newspaper. “China has made capping price rises the
priority of macroeconomic regulation and introduced a host of
targeted policies. These have worked. The overall price level is
within a controllable range and is expected to drop steadily.”  Mizuho Financial rose 1.6 percent to 128 yen in Tokyo,
while in Sydney,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) , the nation’s
largest lender by market value, added 1.3 percent to A$51.13.
National Australia Bank Ltd. climbed 0.8 percent to A$24.66.  Sony gained 2.4 percent to 2,077 yen in Tokyo. Samsung
Electronics Co., which also gets more than 20 percent of its
revenue from Europe, rose 2.5 percent to 852,000 won in Seoul.  Major stock indexes across Asia climbed after European
Union leaders pledged to stabilize the euro-area economy, vowing
to stave off a Greek default as long as the country’s parliament
votes in favor of 78 billion euros ($111 billion) of budget cuts
next week.  ‘Less Contagion Chance’  Europe’s latest attempt to stem the debt crisis came after
bonds of debt-strapped euro nations slumped and officials in the
U.S. and China warned that the euro area’s failure to restore
confidence threatened the world economy.  “The fact that Europe is coming to the aid of Greece is a
positive for the market,“ said Juichi Wako, a senior strategist
at Tokyo-based Nomura Holdings Inc. “It means there’s less of
chance that the crisis spills over into neighboring countries.”  Qantas climbed 1.9 percent to A$1.835 in Sydney on the
prospect of lower fuel prices.  Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd. (293) , Hong
Kong’s largest carrier, advanced 5.3 percent to HK$17.80.  Air China Ltd. (601111) , the world’s biggest carrier by market
capitalization, jumped 7.8 percent to HK$7.76.  China Airlines
Ltd. (2610) , Taiwan’s biggest airline, gained 3.5 percent to NT$19.05.  ‘Airlines Face Challenges’  “In the short-term, oil prices falling alone is a positive
factor for airlines,” said Danny Yan, a fund manager at Haitong
International Asset Management, which oversees $600 million.
“However, airlines still face challenges. The decision to
increase oil supply is only temporary.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.3
percent today. In New York, the index declined 0.3 percent
yesterday after European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet said risk signals for financial stability in the euro
area are flashing “red” as the debt crisis threatens to infect
banks. A bigger-than-estimated increase in U.S. jobless claims
added to signs the world’s biggest economy is slowing.  U.S. stocks also retreated after purchases of new homes
fell in May for the first time in three months, showing the
industry is struggling to gain momentum. Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said this week that a jobless rate
above 9 percent and weakness in housing show the economy may be
facing stronger “headwinds” than Fed policy makers initially
estimated.  Asian Benchmark  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index lost 5.1 percent this year
through yesterday, compared with a gain of 2.1 percent by the
 S&P 500  and a drop of 4.2 percent the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.
Stocks in the Asian benchmark are valued at 13.3 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 13 times for the S&P 500 and
10.7 times for the Stoxx 600.  Woodside Petroleum lost 0.5 percent to A$40.20 in Sydney,
while rival  Santos Ltd. (STO)  dropped 0.8 percent to A$13.27. Chinese
offshore producer  Cnooc Ltd. (883)  sank 1 percent to HK$17.86 in Hong
Kong.  Crude oil for August delivery tumbled 4.6 percent to $91.02
a barrel in New York yesterday, the lowest settlement since Feb.
18, after the International Energy Agency announced that it will
release emergency stockpiles to ease possible shortages. It is
the third time the Paris-based agency has coordinated the use of
emergency stockpiles since its 1974 foundation.  To contact the reporters on this story:
