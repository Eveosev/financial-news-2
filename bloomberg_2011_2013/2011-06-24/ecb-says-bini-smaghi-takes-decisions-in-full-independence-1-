European Central Bank Executive
Board member Lorenzo Bini Smaghi will take any future decision
about his post “in full independence,” the ECB said today.  The Frankfurt-based central bank was responding to queries
about whether Bini Smaghi will step down before his eight-year
term ends to accommodate the appointment of fellow Italian  Mario Draghi  as successor to ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet . “As
President Trichet said, all members of the Executive Board are
appointed for eight years according to the Treaty,” the ECB
said in a statement.  If Bini Smaghi doesn’t step down, Italy would have two of
the six ECB board seats and France would have none. At the same
time, the ECB insists it is independent and immune to political
interference. Bini Smaghi has promised to leave early, German
 Chancellor Angela Merkel  told reporters today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
