Ethanol futures fell to the lowest
price in more than two weeks in  Chicago  amid favorable weather
for corn planting and as gasoline slipped on demand concerns.  The grain-based gasoline additive dropped on warm weather
moving into the corn-rich U.S. Midwest that could aid crop
development. A report from AAA, the nation’s largest motoring
organization, forecast 3 percent fewer Americans will be
traveling by automobile over the July 4 Independence Day
holiday.  “There’s all this macroeconomic bad energy,” said Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean Brokerage LLC
in New York. “Considering the environment, ethanol is doing
alright.”  Denatured ethanol for July delivery slipped 1.4 cents, or
0.5 percent, to settle at $2.633 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the lowest price since June 7. Futures have gained 12
percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  jumped 8.5
cents, or 3.1 percent, to $2.80 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf
the additive increased 7 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $2.795,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago soared 8.5 cents, or 3.2 percent, to
$2.705 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel advanced 4
cents, or 1.4 percent, to $2.815.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 16 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $6.30 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel can make at
least 2.75 gallons of ethanol.  Gasoline for July delivery fell 6.1 cents, or 2.2 percent,
to $2.7766 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Average ethanol mills in  Iowa  earn 4 cents on every gallon
produced, while plants in  Illinois  are pocketing 11 cents on a
spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive, Iowa.  “Margins are still healthy in the front of the curve,”
Breitenbach said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
