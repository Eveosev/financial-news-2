Standard & Poor’s Financial Services
LLC, Moody’s Investors Service Inc. and Fitch Ratings Ltd.
should be kept out of the European market if they fail to meet
European Union requirements in time, a lawmaker from Chancellor
 Angela Merkel ’s political bloc told  Handelsblatt .  The rating companies’ methods lack transparency and are
arbitrary, the newspaper cited Hans Michelbach, a senior finance
committee representative for Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union
and its Christian Social Union sister party, as saying.  Repeated sovereign downgrades even after countries have
taken measures to restore their finances give reason to doubt
the quality of rating decisions, Michelbach told the newspaper.
There is no room in  Europe  for “dubious” rating companies,
Handelsblatt cited him as saying.  Failure by rating companies to improve transparency may
create the impression that they’re “waging an economic war
against the euro,” Michelbach said. The  European Central Bank ’s
reliance on ratings by U.S. companies is untenable, he said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
