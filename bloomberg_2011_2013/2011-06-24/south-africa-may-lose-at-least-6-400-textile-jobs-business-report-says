South Africa  may lose at least 6,400
jobs in the  textile industry  next month when orders are issued
to shut down 252 clothing plants, Business Report said, citing
Leon Deetlefs, the compliance manager at the textiles bargaining
council.  The factories are not meeting the terms of a minimum wage
agreement, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said. The bulk of
the plants are in Durban, on South Africaâ€™s east coast, it said.  Writs to shut the plants cannot be issued until an appeal
against the decision to allow non-compliant companies to phase
in the minimum wage agreement has been heard, the newspaper
cited United Clothing and Textiles Association Chairman Ahmed
Paruk as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
