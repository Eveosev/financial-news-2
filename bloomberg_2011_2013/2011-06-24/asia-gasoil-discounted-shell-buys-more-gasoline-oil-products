Asia gasoil remained discounted
after Hin Leong Trading Pte sold three cargoes and bought one in
 Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-trading center. Royal Dutch
Shell Plc purchased additional cargoes of 97-RON gasoline.  Light Distillates  Benchmark 92-RON gasoline for loading from Singapore traded
at $112 a barrel, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
traders and brokers monitoring transactions on the Platts window.
Vitol Group bought 50,000 barrels for July 14 to July 18 loading
from BP Plc. Vitol sold 50,000 barrels for July 9 to July 13 to
Trafigura Beheer BV at a premium of 50 cents a barrel to
benchmark quotes.  Shell bought two 50,000-barrel cargoes of 97-RON gasoline,
bringing its purchases so far this month to 600,000 barrels, the
survey showed.  Europe ’s largest oil company paid $118.20 a
barrel to Total SA for loading July 9 to July 13 and $118.70 to
Mercuria Energy for July 11 to July 15.  The premium of Japan-delivered naphtha to London-traded
 Brent crude , or the crack spread, fell to $91.60 a metric ton at
5 p.m. Singapore time from $95.19 a ton at the end of Asian
trading yesterday, Bloomberg calculations showed. The crack has
gained $13.75 a ton compared with June 17.  Naphtha swaps for July fell $26.50, or 2.8 percent, to
$905.75 a ton at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates, a broker. Prices declined 2.9 percent this week,
extending last week’s drop of 5 percent.  Middle Distillates  Hin Leong bought 150,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil from Barclays Plc at 70 cents a barrel below benchmark
quotes, according to the survey. The Singapore trader sold two
cargoes totaling 220,000 barrels to BP at discounts of 35 cents
and 55 cents to quotes for the first 10 days of July, and sold
150,000 barrels to Vitol at average July quotes minus 50 cents.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell $1.64
to $16.65 a barrel at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time, based on PVM
data. This crack spread, a measure of refining profit, was at
the narrowest since Feb. 25 and is headed for a second weekly
drop.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil gained 5 cents to 95 cents a
barrel, PVM said. This regrade is down 17 percent this week,
indicating it’s less profitable to produce  aviation fuel .  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 67 cents to
$6.47 a barrel at 3:09 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The difference narrowed for a second week, indicating reduced
losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  July high-sulfur fuel oil swaps fell $18.10, or 2.8 percent,
to $630.40 a ton, set for a second weekly decline, PVM said. The
premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke grade was
unchanged after rebounding to $10. This viscosity spread has
narrowed 13 percent this week, indicating bunker, or marine fuel,
has decreased less than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
