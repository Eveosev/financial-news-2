Gold fell, capping the biggest two-
day drop in seven weeks, as a pledge by European Union leaders
to stabilize the region’s economy slashed demand for the
precious metal as a haven.  EU leaders vowed to stave off a Greek default as long as
Prime Minister  George Papandreou  pushes through a package of
budget cuts next week. The dollar headed for the third straight
weekly advance against the euro, eroding the allure of gold as
an alternative investment. A tumble in energy costs yesterday
reduced demand for the metal as an inflation hedge.  “Gold is losing the flight-to-quality bid in the near term
as the leaders are working toward overcoming the Greek hurdle,”
said  Adam Klopfenstein , a senior strategist at Lind-Waldock, a
broker in  Chicago .  On the Comex in New York, gold futures for August delivery
fell $19.60, or 1.3 percent, to close at $1,500.90 an ounce at
1:45 p.m., the lowest settlement since May 19. In two days, the
metal slumped 3.4 percent, the most since May 5.  Earlier, gold touched $1,498.50, the lowest intraday price
since May 20. The most-active contract declined 2.5 percent this
week.  The metal closed below its 50-day moving average for the
first time since February. Some analysts and investors study
historical charts to predict price changes.  Gold has gained 5.6 percent this year. The price reached a
record $1,577.40 on May 2 as  Greece ’s debt crisis and record-low
U.S. borrowing costs boosted demand for an alternative to
currencies.  Silver Drops  Silver futures for September delivery declined 36.6 cents,
or 1 percent, to $34.65 an ounce. This week, the price dropped
3.1 percent. The metal has gained 12 percent in 2011.  Platinum futures for October delivery fell $17, or 1
percent, to $1,680.50 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . Earlier, the price touched $1,678.50, the lowest since
March 17. The metal, down 4.1 percent this week, has declined
5.5 percent in 2011.  Palladium futures for September delivery slumped $11.85, or
1.6 percent, to $731.50 an ounce. Earlier, the price touched
$731.10, the lowest since May 24. The commodity, down 1.9
percent this week, has declined 8.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters for this story:
