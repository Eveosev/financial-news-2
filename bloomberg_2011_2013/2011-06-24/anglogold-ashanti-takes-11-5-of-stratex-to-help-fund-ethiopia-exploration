AngloGold Ashanti, the world’s
third-largest gold producer, is taking an 11.5 percent stake in
Stratex Internationl Plc, Stratex said in a statement today.  AngloGold will make a 3 million pound private placement
into Stratex, with the funds used partly to fast-track
exploration in the Afar Epithermal gold province in Ethiopia and
 Djibouti , Stratex said.  A spinoff of Stratex’s East African exploration assets
within the next 6-12 months “should be given due consideration
to maximise shareholder value,”  Stratex Chairman Christopher
Hall said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
