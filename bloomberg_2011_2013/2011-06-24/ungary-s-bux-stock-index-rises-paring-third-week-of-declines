Hungarian shares rose, paring a
third week of declines as Mol Nyrt. snapped its longest losing
streak since 2009, offsetting OTP Bank Nyrt.’s retreat.  The benchmark BUX index gained 0.3 percent to 22,378.79 by
the 5 p.m. close in Budapest, paring the week’s decline to 1.4
percent. Mol, the country’s biggest refiner, gained 2.4 percent
to 21,400 forint after 10 days of losses. OTP, the country’s
largest lender, declined 1.9 percent to 5,620 forint, with more
than 829,000 shares changing hands, about 57 percent of the 3-
month average.  Oil rose in  New York , reversing yesterday’s plunge, amid
concern producers including  Saudi Arabia  may reduce output in
response to the International Energy Agency’s move to release
oil stockpiles. Banks were the biggest drag on  Europe ’s
benchmark index after Moody’s Investors Service said it may
downgrade 13 Italian lenders.  The forint was little changed at 269.5 per euro,
depreciating 0.4 percent this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
