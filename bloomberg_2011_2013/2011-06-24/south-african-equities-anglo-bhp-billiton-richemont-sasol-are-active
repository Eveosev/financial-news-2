The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
rose for the first day in three, adding 353.69, or 1.2 percent,
to 30,680.23 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The measure

declines.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the diversified mining company
that makes up 10 percent of the benchmark  stock index , erased
most of yesterday’s loss, rallying 5.91 rand, or 1.9 percent, to
315.40 rand. Metals rose after European leaders showed support
for  Greece , easing concern a default may hurt global growth.
Copper snapped two days of declines, adding as much as 2.1
percent to $9,145 a metric ton.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
Company, surged to its highest close since June 15, gaining 6.54
rand, or 2.7 percent, to 253 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, declined for a second day, falling 3.64 rand, or 1.3
percent, to 278.49 rand. Spot gold dropped 0.9 percent to $1
507.60 an ounce.  DRD Gold Ltd. (DRD SJ),  South Africa ’s fourth largest

maker, closed at its highest in almost three weeks, increasing
1.07 rand, or 2.5 percent, to 43.12 rand. Swiss watch exports
surged 32 percent in May from a year earlier, an industry
federation said yesterday. Growth in global luxury goods sales
is likely to rise 15 percent this year and 11 percent in 2012
versus the industry average of 7 percent to 8 percent expansion,
HSBC Holdings Plc analysts wrote in a note to clients.  Platmin Ltd. (PPN)  , a platinum miner, fell 35 cents, or
7.3 percent, to 4.45 rand, the lowest since March 22. The
company suspended mining at its Pilanesburg platinum mine in
South Africa after employees of one of its mining contractors
“illegally disrupted” operations, it said in a statement.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of vehicle
fuel from coal, gained for the first day in three, adding 2.99
rand, or 0.9 percent, to 341.99 rand. Oil rose as much as 1.3
percent to $92.34 a barrel on concern that producers may reduce
