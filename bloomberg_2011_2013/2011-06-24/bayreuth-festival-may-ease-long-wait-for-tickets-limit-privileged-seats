Bayreuth Festival ’s supervisory
board will examine the way it allocates tickets and make
improvements where needed, after federal auditors criticized
current practices, German Culture Minister Bernd Neumann said.  The Federal Audit Office, or  Bundesrechnungshof , said that
60 percent of tickets to the opera festival are pre-allotted to
privileged groups, such as festival patrons, sponsors, local and
regional government officials and musicians, according to Die
Welt, which said it obtained a copy of the internal report.  The Bundesrechnungshof acknowledged the existence of the
report though it declined to confirm details. Die Welt said the
auditors recommended abolishing the special contingents, saying
they “do not conform with the government’s subsidy goals.”  “Minister Bernd Neumann will ensure that the auditors’
report is discussed in the responsible festival supervisory
bodies,” said a statement from his office sent by e-mail today.
“Where appropriate, the practices will be corrected.”  The Bayreuth Festival takes place every summer in the
theater founded by the composer Richard Wagner in 1876. It is
more than 60 percent privately funded, with the rest of the
financing coming from the federal government, the Bavarian
government and local authorities.  Members of the public can wait as long as 10 years for
tickets and must reapply each year to remain in line.  This year’s festival opens on July 25 with “ Tannhaeuser ,”
directed by Sebastian Baumgarten with Thomas Hengelbrock
conducting. It ends on Aug. 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
