Commodities rebounded from the
lowest level in more than four months led by gains in crude oil
and copper as investors maintained their bullish outlook for
raw-materials demand.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI index of 24 commodities rallied
as much as 1 percent to 655.20, paring yesterday’s 3.6 percent
slump that was driven by a drop in crude after the  International
Energy Agency  said it will release oil stockpiles. Oil in New
York jumped as much as 1.5 percent, copper in London climbed as
much as 1.2 percent, and corn in Chicago rose 1 percent.  “I’m bullish commodities and see it as a chance to buy,”
said  Tetsu Emori , a  fund manager  at Astmax Co. Ltd. in Tokyo.
The decline yesterday was “an exaggeration.” The index’s drop
was the biggest fall since May 11 and it ended at 648.75, the
lowest level since Feb. 8.  Crude for August delivery climbed as much as $1.32 to
$92.34 per barrel, and was at $92.22 at on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 12:10 p.m. in  Singapore . The contract
yesterday slid to $91.02 a barrel, the lowest settlement since
Feb. 18. Still, the price is up 21 percent over the past year.  “Oil no longer looks expensive,”  Tobias Merath , head of
commodity research at Credit Suisse at Credit Suisse AG in
Zurich, said today in a report. Global demand growth may be more
than 1 million barrels a day in the third quarter, he said.  The IEA announced the release of 2 million barrels a day
for 30 days to make up for supplies choked off by an armed
rebellion in Libya. It’s only the third time in the history of
the Paris-based agency that the stockpiles have been tapped.  Weekly Loss  The S&P GSCI is set for a second weekly loss after shedding
4.7 percent last week. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
on June 22 reiterated a pledge to keep  interest rates  near zero
as the central bank reduced its growth and employment forecasts
for the world’s biggest economy.  “We’re seeing a bit of a relief rally today, which will be
difficult to sustain as the global macroeconomic environment
isn’t supportive,”  Li Qiang , an analyst at Xinhu Futures Co.,
said from Shanghai referring to base-metal prices.  Copper for three-month delivery on the  London  Metal
Exchange climbed as much as $105 to $9,065 a metric ton, and
traded at $9,060. Copper, used to make pipes and wires, is
little changed this week and 5.6 percent lower this year.  Corn for December delivery gained as much as 6.75 cents to
$6.5275 per bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade, while wheat
and soybeans also climbed. Rubber futures on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange reversed losses, with the November-delivery contract
gaining as much as 1.1 percent to 364.5 yen per kilogram.  To contact the reporter on this story:
