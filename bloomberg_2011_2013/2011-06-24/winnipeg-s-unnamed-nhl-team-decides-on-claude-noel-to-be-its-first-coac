Winnipeg’s relocated National Hockey
League team has a new coach. It still doesn’t have a name.  Claude Noel, who last season coached the city’s American
Hockey League team, the Manitoba Moose, will be behind the bench
in October when the NHL returns to Winnipeg for the first time
since 1996, General Manager Kevin Cheveldayoff said today in a
news conference. The team has the No. 7 pick in the  NHL Draft ,
which starts tonight in  St. Paul , Minnesota, and is yet to
announce a nickname.  “We have a great opportunity ahead of us,” Noel, 55, said
from the Westin Hotel in Minneapolis. “I really look forward to
building a good tight team that’s going to play hard and play
for each other.”  This week, the league’s board of governors voted in New
York to approve the sale of the Atlanta Thrashers to Winnipeg-
based True North Sports & Entertainment Ltd. The team will play
in Winnipeg’s 15,000-seat MTS Centre starting with the 2011-12
season.  Noel spent three years as an assistant with the Columbus
Blue Jackets from 2007-2010, and became head coach for three
months in 2010 when the team fired Ken Hitchcock, going 10-8-6.
Last season, Noel led the Moose to a 43-40-1-6 record. In
addition to the NHL and AHL, he has coaching experience in the
ECHL.  Cheveldayoff said conversations with a number of Noel’s
former players were a big factor in the team’s decision. He
called Noel a “tremendous leader, a person who spends a lot of
time getting to know each and every individual player.”  Coaching Candidates  The team also interviewed Chicago Blackhawks assistant Mike Haviland, former player Craig Mactavish and Craig Ramsay, who
coached the Thrashers until the team’s sale, according to the
Winnipeg Free Press.  Winnipeg lost its previous NHL team, the Jets, when the
franchise moved to  Arizona  in 1996 and became the  Phoenix
Coyotes . Suggestions for the team’s new nickname include the
Jets and the Manitoba Falcons, in honor of the Winnipeg Falcons,
who won  Canada ’s first Olympic hockey gold medal in 1920. An
 online petition  calling for the team to regain the Jets nickname
has gathered more than 13,600 signatures.  Cheveldayoff called the team’s naming situation an
“ongoing process.”  “A lot of time, a lot of thought has been put into it,”
he said. “You don’t make a decision just for the sake of doing
it.”  The new team will be the NHL’s seventh Canadian team,
joining the  Vancouver Canucks , Calgary Flames,  Toronto Maple
Leafs , Edmonton Oilers,  Montreal Canadiens  and  Ottawa Senators .  -- Editors: Rob Gloster, Michael Sillup  To contact the reporter on this story:
