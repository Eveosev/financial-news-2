Compagnie Financiere Richemont SA
closed at its highest in almost three weeks as Swiss watch
exports surged in May, while Nomura Holdings Inc. and  HSBC
Holdings Plc (HSBA)  recommended buying shares in the  luxury goods  group
on rising global demand.  The stock rose 1.07 rand, or 2.5 percent, to 43.12 rand by
the 5 p.m. end of trading in Johannesburg, the highest closing
level since June 6.  Swiss watch exports climbed 32 percent in May from a year
earlier, the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry said
yesterday.  “Strong growth in luxury watches is supportive to
Richemont,” Nomura analysts including London-based Allegra Perry wrote in an e-mailed note to clients. Nomura has a “buy”
rating on the stock.  Global demand for luxury goods is likely to rise 15 percent
this year and 11 percent in 2012 versus the industry average of
7 percent to 8 percent, HSBC analysts wrote in a note to clients
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
