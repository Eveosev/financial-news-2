European Union leaders were locked
in last-minute talks to clear the appointment of Italy’s  Mario Draghi  as European Central Bank president in a showdown that
raised fresh questions over the bank’s independence.  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  sought assurances that
another Italian on the ECB’s six-member board, Lorenzo Bini Smaghi, would quit early to make way for a Frenchman, three
officials said on the concluding day of an  EU summit  in
Brussels.  One option is for an endorsement of Draghi today, while EU
President  Herman Van Rompuy  puts off signing the nomination
papers until Bini Smaghi’s departure is assured, said the
officials, who declined to be named because the talks are in
progress.  Bini Smaghi has agreed to leave by year end, France's
Le Monde  reported  today, without saying where it got the
information.  Sarkozy was backed into a corner by the release of a draft
statement, prepared overnight, that proclaimed the 63-year-old
Draghi the ECB’s next president as of Nov. 1.  Coming as European leaders sought to project a united front
over a second bailout for debt-stricken Greece, the deal was
clouded by the same political maneuvering that marked the
appointment of outgoing ECB President  Jean-Claude Trichet .  A Massachusetts Institute of Technology-trained economist
with a stint at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  on his resume, Draghi
has already been backed by finance ministers and is the only
candidate to take over the Frankfurt-based ECB.  To contact the reporters on this story:
