European governments should focus on
ensuring their countries’ banks are sufficiently capitalized
before demanding that they participate in a Greek bailout, Bank
of England policy maker  Adam Posen  wrote in  Handelsblatt .  Europe should create a trust for banks that would compel
governments to recapitalize or dismantle troubled banks, Posen
wrote in a guest commentary in Handelsblatt today.  Capital
requirements  should be established that go beyond the Basel III
rules, he wrote.  A delay in addressing banks’ capital needs is shifting the
burden of the European debt crisis to the public sector and
delaying a resolution to Greece’s solvency crisis, Posen wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
