Deena Mehta, managing director of
Asit C. Mehta Investment Interrmediates Ltd. and former
president of the Bombay Stock Exchange, comments on the outlook
for Indian stocks. She spoke today in a phone interview.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, rose
2.8 percent to 18,216.62 at 3:07 p.m. local time.  On stocks outlook:  “Investors are finding value in stocks, which are near to
their bottom levels. The average price-to-earnings ratio of
stocks currently is around 13 to 14. Historically, P/E-based
valuations for Indian stocks have never gone below 13 in the
last two decades. There was no fundamental reason behind the
recent sharp stocks decline and so a rebound was on the cards.”  On Sensex target:  “We expect the Sensex to rebound to 22,000 levels. On the
upside, we expect the price-earnings ratio to go all the way to
25. We are advising clients to buy Nifty BEES as we expect the
broad market to rebound fast. We expect inflation to come down
in two to three months as good rainfall will moderate food
prices.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
