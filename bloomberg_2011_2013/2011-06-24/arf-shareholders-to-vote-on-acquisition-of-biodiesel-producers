Shareholders of  Australian Renewable
Fuels Ltd. (ARW) , a Melbourne-based developer of biofuel projects,
will vote on June 28 a plan by management to acquire Biodiesel
Producers Ltd.  The proposed purchase would boost Australian Renewable’s
production capacity by 67 percent to more than 150 million
liters a year and generate annual sales of $170 million, the
company said in a statement sent to the Australian Stock
Exchange today.  Australian Renewable said in January that it signed a non-
binding agreement to buy Barnawartha, Victoria-based Biodiesel
Producers. Under the deal, Australian Renewable would assume
Biodiesel Producers’ convertible bonds with a redemption value
of A$21 million ($22 million).  Australian Renewable also said it has entered into a long-
term agreement with GlobalBiofuels Trading Inc. for the supply
at least 30 million liters of feedstock at margins similar to or
better than local domestic sales.  Besok Ltd., a unit of Australian Renewable, may expand its
ownership to include GlobalBiofuels Trading to create an
international feedstock and fuel trader, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
