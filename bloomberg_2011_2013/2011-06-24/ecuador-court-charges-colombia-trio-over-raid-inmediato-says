An Ecuadorean court will proceed
with criminal lawsuits against three former Colombian security
officials over their alleged role in the bombing of a guerrilla
camp on  Ecuador ’s territory in 2008, Ecuadorinmediato reported.  A court in the northern border province of Sucumbios
accused General Freddy Padilla, the former head of Colombia’s
army, Oscar Naranjo, head of the nation’s police, and Mario Montoya, former commander of the country’s armed forces, with
homicide for their role in a March 2008 bombing of a
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia base camp, the Quito-
based newspaper said today on its website.  The attack killed at least 23 rebels including  Raul Reyes ,
second-in-command of the guerrilla group known as the FARC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
