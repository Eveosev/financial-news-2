Coal exports from the U.S. may rise
as a weaker dollar makes the power-plant and steelmaking
component attractive to foreign buyers, said Ernie Thrasher,
chief executive officer of Xcoal Energy & Resources LLC.  Producers in the U.S. may fetch as much as $370 a ton for
their highest-quality coal, compared with the benchmark price of
$315 a ton settled this month, Thrasher said today at the IHS
McCloskey Coal USA Conference 2011 in  New York .  Exports of U.S. coal may reach 98 million tons this year,
the Energy Department forecast June 7, up from  81.7 million  in
2010 and the highest level since 1992 when the country shipped
102.5 million tons.  Thrasher said coal shipments to foreign customers may be
capped at 100 million tons by port capacity.  Exports of metallurgical coal are expected to jump 17
percent this year to 65.6 million tons, according to the Energy
Department, the highest in at least 15 years.  Asian steelmakers agreed last week to pay Anglo American
Plc $315 a metric ton for the September quarter, according to
UBS AG, down from a record $330. The contract is regarded as an
industry benchmark.  Peabody Energy Corp. (BTU) , the largest U.S. coal producer, said
yesterday that it’s going through the permit process to develop
a port on the West Coast to supply Asian customers.  Erik Ludtke, the St. Louis-based company’s president of
sales, marketing and trading, said yesterday that he expects the
company to explore export opportunities in the U.S. Gulf Coast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
