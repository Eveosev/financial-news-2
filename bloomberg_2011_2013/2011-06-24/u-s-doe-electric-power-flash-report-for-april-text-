The following is the text of the
Electric Power Flash report from the U.S. Department of Energy:  The contiguous  United States  experienced temperatures that were
above normal in April 2011.  Accordingly, the total population-
weighted heating degree days for the United States were 8.4
percent below the April normal.  In April 2011, retail sales of electricity increased 3.1 percent
from April 2010.  Over the same period, the average U.S. retail
price of electricity increased 1.0 percent.  The average U.S.
retail price of electricity for the 12-month period ending April
2011 increased 1.6 percent over the previous 12-month period
ending April 2010.  The total electric power generation in the United States
increased 4.1 percent compared to April 2010 (the change in
electric power generation does not necessarily coincide with the
change in retail sales of electricity because utility billing
cycles tend to lag electricity production in many areas).  Over
the same period, coal generation decreased 2.2 percent, while
natural gas generation increased 4.2 percent and petroleum
liquids generation increased 21.9 percent.  Conventional
hydroelectric generation had the largest percentage change,
increasing 67.3 percent from the previous year.  This was mainly
due to record amounts of precipitation that fell in the
Northwest in April 2011.  Nuclear generation decreased 5.3
percent as more nuclear plants were offline due to refueling
outages in April 2011 than the previous year.  In April 2011, coal plants continued the spring build-up of coal
for consumption in the summer months.  However, this year’s
spring build-up of coal stocks has been less severe than last
year’s spring build-up of coal stocks.  Accordingly, total coal
stocks in April 2011 decreased 7.8 percent when compared to
April 2010.  SOURCE: U.S. Department of Energy
