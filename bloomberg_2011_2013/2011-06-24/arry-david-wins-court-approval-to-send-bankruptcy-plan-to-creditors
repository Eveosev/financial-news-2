Harry & David Holdings Inc., the
gift-box retailer that began selling fruit by mail in the 1930s,
won court permission to send its bankruptcy-exit plan to
creditors for a vote.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath today gave the company
permission to seek the vote on a reorganization plan that would
give the company to senior noteholders in exchange for canceling
more than $200 million in debt. Creditors have until the end of
July to vote, company attorney Brad Erens said in an interview.
The exact deadline will be set soon, he said.  The main opposition to the plan comes from the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp., the federal agency that would be forced
to take over payments to Harry & David’s pension if Walrath
grants the company’s request to cancel the retirement program.
The PBGC says Harry & David would owe $45 million should the
 pension plan  be canceled, a figure the company disputes.  “We think the amount of the claim that PBGC is asserting
is way overstated,” Erens said.  Harry & David, based in Medford,  Oregon , filed for
bankruptcy in March, blaming competition from Internet
retailers, warehouse-style stores and the recession.  Walrath will take the vote of creditors into consideration
when she holds a hearing on Aug. 11 to decide whether to approve
the reorganization plan.  The case is In re Harry & David Holdings, Inc., 11-10884,
 U.S. Bankruptcy Court , District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
