Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, expects home sales
to rise by 10 percent in the year through next April, nearing
the peak of the company’s capacity.  Berkeley sold 2,544 homes at an average of 271,000 pounds
($434,000) in the year through April 2011, a 16 percent increase
over the previous fiscal year, the Cobham, England-based builder
said in a statement today. The total will rise to around 3,000
homes in the next year before leveling off, Managing Director
Rob Perrins said in an interview.  “Unless there is an external shock, I think we’re slowly
recovering out of this recession,” Perrins said.  Berkeley, the best-performing U.K. homebuilder this year,
has benefited from its concentration in  London  and southeast
England, where the recovery in  house prices  has been the
strongest. The company abandoned high-volume homebuilding in
2004 and concentrated on building houses rather than apartments
in urban areas.  The rise in sales helped Berkeley increase full-year profit
by 19 percent, the company said in a statement today. The stock
rose the most in almost three years after the company said it
will pay shareholders dividends of 1.7 billion pounds over the
next decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
