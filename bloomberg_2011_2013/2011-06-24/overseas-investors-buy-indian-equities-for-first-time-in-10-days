Overseas investors bought a net 4.84
billion rupees ($108 million) of Indian stocks yesterday, the
first purchase in 10 days, paring their withdrawals from local
equities this year to 19.3 billion rupees, according to data
from the nation’s market regulator.  Foreigners bought 21.6 billion rupees of shares and sold
16.7 billion rupees, the  Securities and Exchange Board of India 
said  today . They purchased 1.79 billion rupees of bonds, taking
total net inflows into debt this year to 145.3 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. The Sensex has
fallen 11.1 percent this year, the second-worst performer  among
Asian benchmark indexes tracked by Bloomberg.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest advance in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from stocks in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.452 trillion rupees in equities and 932 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
