Spot gasoline in  Los Angeles 
narrowed its discount to futures for the third consecutive day
as traders bet that the fuel will strengthen for July delivery.  The discount for California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in
Los Angeles narrowed 2.5 cents to 1 cent a gallon versus futures
traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 2:02 p.m. New
York time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Seemed to be a lot of interest in July LA Carbob this
morning,” said Randy Simpson, vice president of supply and
trading at Idemitsu Apollo Corp. in Sacramento,  California .
“Maybe people are stepping in to take a punt on July
improving.”  The discount for the same fuel in  San Francisco  narrowed
2.25 cents to 3.75 cents a gallon versus futures. Conventional,
87-octane gasoline in  Portland , Oregon, strengthened 4 cents to
6.5 cents a gallon versus futures.  Trading for May and June was “a train wreck,” said Chris
Mennis, who owns oil broker New Wave Energy LLC in Aptos,
California. Carbob has settled at a discount to futures in Los
Angeles every day since May 6.  “It is driving season and early for July, so the longs
give it a go,” Mennis said.  The premium for California-blend, low-sulfur diesel in Los
Angeles rose 0.5 cent to 9 cents after falling 0.25 cent
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
