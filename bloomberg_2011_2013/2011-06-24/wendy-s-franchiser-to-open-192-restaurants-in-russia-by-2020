The exclusive franchiser for Wendy’s
restaurants in  Russia  plans to open 192 outlets in the country
by 2020, involving investment of $132 million.  Wenrus Restaurant Group Ltd. plans to invest $40 million in
the first five years, it said in a presentation. The first 50
restaurants will be opened by 2015, said Alexandra Boeva, an
external spokeswoman for Wenrus. The first two Wendy’s
restaurants in Russia opened in Moscow in June, and Wenrus may
open outlets in Ukraine and  Kazakhstan  in 2012 as well, she said
in an interview.  Wendy’s/Arby’s Group Inc., the chain’s Atlanta-based parent
company, said in August 2010 that Wenrus would build 180 dual-
branded restaurants in 10 years in Russia. The restaurants will
offer Arby’s menu items as well, under the Wendy’s brand name,
Boeva said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
