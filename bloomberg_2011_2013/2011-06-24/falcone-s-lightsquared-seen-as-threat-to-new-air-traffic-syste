Philip Falcone ’s LightSquared
wireless venture may cause interference that could disrupt or
halt a $40 billion overhaul of the U.S. aircraft control system,
aviation executives and members of Congress said.  The NextGen air-traffic control network being developed by
the government will use signals from global-positioning system
satellites to guide aircraft. LightSquared plans to send
wireless signals on nearby airwaves, and makers and users of GPS
devices say those transmissions may overwhelm navigation
satellites’ faint signals.  The global-positioning system “serves a critical role” in
NextGen, Representative Tom Petri, a Wisconsin Republican, said
yesterday at a hearing of the House aviation subcommittee that
he chairs.  LightSquared “must not interfere with aviation safety,  job
creation , or NextGen,” Petri said. “In aviation, there’s no
room for error.”  Under NextGen, the  Federal Aviation Administration  is
seeking to simultaneously deploy dozens of technologies to raise
efficiency in guiding aircraft through U.S. airspace, the
world’s busiest. Companies including  Boeing Co. (BA) ,  ITT Corp. (ITT) ,
 Raytheon Co. (RTN)  and  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  are working on equipment
upgrades, including the use of satellites rather than ground-
based radar to direct aircraft.  Revamping navigation equipment on commercial aircraft to
accommodate LightSquared would cost billions of dollars, and
halt implementation of NextGen, Tom Hendricks, a senior vice
president with the  Air Transport Association , said during
yesterday’s hearing.  $8 Billion Spent  LightSquared’s service may “effectively render GPS signals
unusable over the populated areas of the  United States ,” said
Hendricks, whose Washington-based trade group includes  Delta Air
Lines Inc. (DAL) , the biggest U.S. passenger carrier,  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s
American Airlines and  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS) , which flies
cargo.  Hendricks urged lawmakers not to let LightSquared proceed
if it interferes with GPS. Petri said LightSquared’s plan should
be thoroughly tested. The U.S. government and private industry
have spent $8 billion on NextGen, according to testimony by Roy Kienitz, undersecretary for policy at the U.S. Transportation
Department.  LightSquared, backed by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital
Partners hedge fund, plans to invest $15 billion to serve
mobile-Web users over a network of 40,000 base stations, using
airwaves previously reserved mainly for satellite services
including GPS.  The Federal Communications Commission, which granted
preliminary approval to LightSquared in January, has ordered the
Reston, Virginia-based company to deliver a report on
interference by July 1 to help the agency decide whether to
grant final clearance.  LightSquared Revision  A U.S. advisory panel concluded that LightSquared would
degrade GPS devices as far away as outer space and recommended
that regulators revoke the tentative approval of the project.  To reduce interference, LightSquared will use different
airwaves than it had intended, Chief Executive Officer Sanjiv Ahuja said in an interview on June 20. The change would resolve
interference concerns for all but a limited number of users such
as farm-equipment makers, he said.  The proposed solution would resolve interference problems
for 99 percent of GPS users, and the company wants to discuss
how it can make use of more airwaves, said Jeff Carlisle, an
executive vice president of LightSquared.  “LightSquared has no intention of operating its system in
a way that will compromise government or commercial aviation or
maritime operations,” Carlisle said during yesterday’s hearing.  ‘Not Compatible’  LightSquared’s original plan “is not compatible” with GPS
operation, said Kienitz, the Transportation Department official.  “That doesn’t mean the story is over,” Kienitz told
lawmakers. LightSquared’s alternative “has promise” and “any
plan needs to be thoroughly tested before it goes forward,” he
said.  LightSquared’s June 20 proposal is “going to require
months and months of additional testing and analysis,” said
Bobby Sturgell, a senior vice president with  Rockwell Collins
Inc. (COL) , which makes aviation electronics. “The other option is to
go find some frequency somewhere away from GPS.”  “If this system went forward as proposed, it would
absolutely interfere with NextGen,” Sturgell said in an
interview.  Other companies that have expressed concern include farm
equipment maker  Deere & Co. (DE)  and  General Motors Co. (GM) , which said
its OnStar navigation service was affected during trials. Its
position hasn’t changed as a result of LightSquared’s June 20
announcement, OnStar spokesman Vijay Iyer said in an interview.  “We still want to keep testing it,” Iyer said. “If
there’s new things to test, we want to keep testing them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
