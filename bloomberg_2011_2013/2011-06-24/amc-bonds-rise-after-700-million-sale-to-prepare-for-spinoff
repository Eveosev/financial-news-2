Bonds from AMC Networks Inc. are
rising as the owner and operator of cable channels funds its
spinoff from  Cablevision Systems Corp. (CVC)   The company’s $700 million of 7.75 percent notes due in
July 2021 have risen 2.25 cents on the dollar to a mid-price of
102.25 cents since being issued two days ago, according to New
York-based Brownstone Investment Group LLC.  AMC Networks, formerly known as Rainbow Media, has been
selling bonds as it prepares to become a separate publicly
traded company, according to a statement on June 6. AMC will
raise a total $2.43 billion of debt to fund its leveraged
spinoff from Cablevision, according to KDP Investment Advisors.  The senior note offering on June 22 included 12
underwriters and six co-managers, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The arrangers were Bank of America Corp.,  Barclays
Capital , Citigroup Inc., Credit Agricole SA, Credit Suisse Group
AG, Goldman Sachs Group Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., Morgan
Stanley, Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, SunTrust Robinson
Humphrey, UBS AG and US Bancorp.  When Cablevision last sold bonds, in July, the company
hired six syndicate desks to act as lead managers: Bank of
America, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank AG, Goldman
Sachs and JPMorgan.  AMC, which operates the Sundance Channel, has boosted its
national appeal with Emmy-award winning “Mad Men,” a drama
about a New York advertising firm set in the 1960s and
“Breaking Bad,” about a teacher who sells methamphetamines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
