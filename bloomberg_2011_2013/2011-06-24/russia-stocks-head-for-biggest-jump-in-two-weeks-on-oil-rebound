Russia ’s Micex Index rose the most
in two weeks as oil rebounded from yesterday’s drop of more than
$5 a barrel.  The 30-stock gauge gained 1.6 percent to 1,633.99 at the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, the biggest advance since June 9 and
paring its second consecutive weekly loss to 0.7 percent. OAO
Gazprom, the gas export monopoly, climbed 1.6 percent while OAO
Sberbank, Russia’s largest lender, rose 3 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index climbed 1.5 percent to 1,857.04.  Oil prices  sank yesterday after the  International Energy
Agency  announced it would release some of its emergency
stockpiles for the third time since it was founded in 1974.
Crude, Russia’s main export earner, rose as much as 1.5 percent
today to $92.34 a barrel on expectations producers including
 Saudi Arabia  may reduce output in response to the IEA’s
decision.  “People realize that an inventory release is only a
temporary measure and may even signal that supply disruptions
may last longer and demand stays robust,” Peter Szopo, head of
research at  Alfa Bank  in Moscow, wrote in response to e-mailed
questions.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil company, gained 1
percent, snapping its longest losing streak since April 14. OAO
Lukoil, OAO  Tatneft (TATN)  and OAO Surgutneftegas also rose, climbing
1.6 percent, 3.1 percent and 2 percent respectively.  “The sharp decline in oil prices appears to have ceased,”
Kirill Bakhtin, a Moscow-based analyst at TKB Capital, wrote in
an e-mailed report. “Analysts are yet to estimate long-term
effects of yesterday’s decision by the IEA.”  Global Ports Investments Plc, which handles more than a
quarter of fuel exports from Russia, raised $534 million in an
initial public offering of global depositary receipts in  London ,
it said in a statement today. The receipts rose 8 percent to
$16.20 on their first day of trading.  -- Editors: Alex Nicholson, Linda Shen  To contact the reporter on this story:
