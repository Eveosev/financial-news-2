The  Federal Reserve  will release the
minutes of its June meeting on July 12, according to an
announcement by the central bank.  The release time, originally scheduled for July 13, was
changed so as not to coincide with Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke â€™s
semi-annual monetary policy report to Congress on that day, the
central bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
