Philex Mining Corp. (PX) , the largest
Philippine metals producer, rose to a record in Manila trading
on speculation that an upgrade in the country’s sovereign-debt
rating will cut funding costs at its Silangan mine.  The shares jumped 9.6 percent to 23.35 pesos as of 11:36
a.m. local time, set for the highest close since at least
January 1990.  “Philex’s borrowing costs could go down after the
improvement in the nation’s sovereign-debt rating,” said Astro
del Castillo, managing director at First Grade Holdings Inc.
“The company’s Silangan project becomes more feasible and
profitable as funding costs go down.”  The  Philippines ’s debt rating was raised to BB+, one level
below investment grade, from BB by  Fitch Rating  yesterday.  Philex Chairman Manuel Pangilinan said June 22 that the
company will spend $1 billion over three years to develop its
Silangan gold and copper project, which has an estimated five
billion pounds of copper and 9 million ounces of gold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
