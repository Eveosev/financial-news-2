Peruvian bonds posted their biggest
weekly rise in eight months as traders bet the central bank will
raise borrowing costs more slowly than expected amid less
private investment.  The yield on the nation’s 9.91 percent sol-denominated bond
due May 2015 fell 28 basis points, or 0.28 percentage point,
this week to 5.47 percent, according to prices compiled by
Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.95 centimo to 115.19 centimos
per sol, the steepest rise since the week ending Oct. 15. The
yield fell 1 basis point today.  Peruvian growth has “practically stagnated” and the speed
with which it accelerates will depend on the economic policies
President-elect Ollanta Humala adopts when he takes office July
28, Banco de Credito del  Peru , the nation’s largest bank, said
in a June 22 report. The slowdown in activity suggests the
central bank isn’t in a hurry to raise its benchmark rate, after
pausing this month for the first time this year, Banco de
Credito said.  “We know that this cycle will dampen growth prospects,”
said  Siobhan Morden , head of Latin American strategy at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “We have a higher
premium in the curve, and that means a slowdown in the economy
and a reluctance to take on new investment.”  The central bank will keep its benchmark rate unchanged at
4.25 percent for the rest of this year amid slowing growth and
easing inflationary pressures, Barclays Capital Inc. said June
20. Barclays had said April 1 that the central bank will raise
the rate to 5.5 percent by August.  The sol was little changed at 2.7601 per  U.S. dollar , from
2.7595 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
