Portuguese banks have very small
holdings of Greek  government bonds , reducing the risk to them,
Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  said.  “With the information that we have available today, there
is very little exposure of Portuguese banks to Greek debt,”
Passos Coelho told reporters after a European Union summit in
Brussels today. “So surely that will not be a big problem in
our financial system.”  Germany, France and the Netherlands have started talks with
banks and insurers on getting private investors to take part in
a Greek rescue. German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  and French
President Nicolas Sarkozy agreed last week to pursue a Vienna
Initiative-style solution for Greece, encouraging creditors to
roll over expiring bonds until the country’s austerity program
shows results or a permanent rescue fund starts in mid-2013.  Passos Coelho leads a government that will have to
implement an austerity plan that was a condition of a 78
billion-euro ($111 billion) financial-aid package from the EU
and the  International Monetary Fund . With the country’s debt and
borrowing costs surging, Portugal followed Greece and Ireland in
April in seeking a bailout.  Banco Comercial Portugues SA (BCP) , Portugal’s second-biggest
publicly traded bank by market value, holds about 700 million
euros of Greek government debt, Chief Executive Officer Carlos Santos Ferreira said on June 7. “I’m not worried,” he told
reporters. He said between 40 million euros and 50 million euros
of the bonds mature this year and that Banco Comercial is
willing to maintain holdings of Greek debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
