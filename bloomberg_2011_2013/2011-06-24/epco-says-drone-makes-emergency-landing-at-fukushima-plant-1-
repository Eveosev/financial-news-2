Tokyo  Electric Power Co. said a T-
Hawk drone aircraft made an emergency landing today on the roof
of the No. 2 reactor building at its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi
nuclear plant.  The unmanned aircraft lost control while collecting dust
samples around the building, Junichi Matsumoto, general manager
at the utility known as Tepco, told reporters at a news
conference in Tokyo today. The 8-kilogram (18-pound) helicopter
probably didnâ€™t pierce the roof of the reactor, he said.  No smoke or fire has been reported, Matsumoto said. The
company is preparing a crane to investigate damage to the
aircraft and the building, Satoshi Watanabe, a spokesman for the
utility, said by telephone.  To contact the reporters on this story:
