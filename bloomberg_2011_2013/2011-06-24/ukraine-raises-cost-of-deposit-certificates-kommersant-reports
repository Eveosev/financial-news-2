Ukraineâ€™s central bank raised the
cost of deposit certificates to remove excessive liquidity from
the market,  Kommersant-Ukraine  reported, citing a central bank
document it obtained a copy of.  The annual interest for two-week certificates was raised to
3.3 percent from 2.5 percent and 29-day certificates to 4
percent from 3 percent, the newspaper said.  The cost of 43-day certificates increased to 5 percent from
3.5 percent and the cost of 89-day certificates to 6.8 percent
from 5 percent, the newspaper said.  The move is aimed at keeping the monetary mass within the
limits set by the International Monetary Fund, Kommersant said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
