Sri Lanka  opening batsman Upul Tharanga was suspended three months by the International Cricket
Council for testing positive for a banned substance during the
World Cup.  The 26-year-old admitted the offense, saying he ingested
the substance when drinking a herbal remedy given to him for a
shoulder injury, the  ICC  said in a statement.  “I hope my fellow sportsmen will learn from my experience
and be more vigilant when taking medical treatment, so that
their career do not suffer in the way that mine has,” Tharanga
said in the governing body’s statement.  Though the ICC accepted Tharanga had no intention of
enhancing his performance or masking the use of another
performance enhancing drug, he still received a suspension,
which was backdated to May 9.  “Cases like this serve as a reminder to all players that
they must take great care and personal responsibility at all
times for the substances that they consume,” ICC Chief
Executive Haroon Lorgat said.  Tharanga was tested following the World Cup semifinal
victory over  New Zealand  on March 29. Sri Lanka then lost to
India in the final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
