Poland ’s WIG20 Index fell 6.15, or
0.2 percent, to close at 2,801.59, bringing the gauge’s decline
for the week to 2.7 percent.  The  Warsaw Stock Exchange  was closed yesterday for a public
holiday.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
Warsaw bourse today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Cyfrowy Polsat SA (CPS)  , Poland’s second-largest
television network, gained 0.3 zloty, or 1.9 percent, to 16
zloty. The stock, which closed at the lowest level in almost
three months on June 22, offers an “attractive entry point,”
UBS AG wrote in a note to clients yesterday.  Katowickie Przedsiebiorstwo Budownictwa Przemyslowego Budus
SA (BDS PW) jumped 3.4 zloty, or 12 percent, to 30.9 zloty as
the construction company started trading on the Warsaw bourse’s
NewConnect market for smaller companies.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  , the copper producer with the
biggest European mine output, climbed for a third day, adding
2.6 zloty, or 1.4 percent, to 188.6 zloty. Copper gained after
European leaders showed support for  Greece , easing concern that
a default may hurt global growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
