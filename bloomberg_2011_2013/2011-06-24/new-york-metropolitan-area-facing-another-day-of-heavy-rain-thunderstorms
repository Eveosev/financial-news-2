Another day of heavy rain and
potential thunderstorms is ahead for the  New York City  area as
flash flood watches and warnings are in effect until 1 a.m.
tomorrow, according to the National Weather Service.  As much as 1.5 inches (3.8 centimeters) may fall today,
said  Joe Pollina , a weather service meteorologist in  Upton, New
York .  “It looks like later this afternoon when we will see the
showers and thunderstorms coming through,” Pollina said.  About a quarter-inch was reported at New York’s Central
Park yesterday, while 2.41 inches fell in Bridgeport,
 Connecticut , breaking the record for the date set in 1967,
according to the weather service.  Scranton,  Pennsylvania , received 1.58 inches, breaking the
daily mark set in 1956.  Golf ball-sized hail was reported in Nyack,  New York , and
trees were knocked down in several locations in New York,
Pennsylvania,  New Jersey  and Connecticut from high winds caused
by thunderstorms, according to the  Storm Prediction Center  in
Norman,  Oklahoma .  New York City and the surrounding area have a 15 percent
chance of experiencing damaging winds today. Flash-flood
warnings and watches have been issued for northern New Jersey,
the lower Hudson Valley including New York, Nassau County on
Long Island and Fairfield County in Connecticut, according to
the weather service.  The Hackensack River at Riverdale, New Jersey, rose 4.64
feet since noon yesterday, according to the weather service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
