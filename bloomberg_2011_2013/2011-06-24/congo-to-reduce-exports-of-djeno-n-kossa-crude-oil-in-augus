The Republic of Congo will export
six cargoes of Djeno crude in October, one less than September,
according to a loading program obtained by Bloomberg News.  The country also plans to ship one consignment of N’Kossa
grade in October, compared with two next month, the plan showed.
All shipments are 950,000 barrels each. Total SA,  France ’s
largest oil producer, operates the two fields.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
