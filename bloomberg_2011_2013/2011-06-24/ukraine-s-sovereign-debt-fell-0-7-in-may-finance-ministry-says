Ukraine’s debt, including state
guarantees, fell 0.7 percent in May as the government repaid
some foreign and domestic credits, the  Finance Ministry  said.  Sovereign debt declined to $57.8 billion as of May 31 from
$58.2 billion a month earlier, the ministry, based in the
capital Kiev, said late yesterday in a  statement  on its website.  Domestic debt eased to $19.17 billion from $19.22 billion
at the end of April, the ministry said. Obligations to foreign
creditors fell to $24.1 billion from $24.3 billion, according to
the statement.  Ukraine’s state debt rose 6.4 percent in the first five
months of 2011 as the government sold Eurobonds and domestic
bonds to cover the budget deficit and as the hryvnia weakened
against foreign currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
