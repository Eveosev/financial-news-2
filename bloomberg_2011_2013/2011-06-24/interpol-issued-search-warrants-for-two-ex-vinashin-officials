Interpol  issued global search
warrants for two former officials of  Vietnam Shipbuilding
Industry Group , or Vinashin, following a request from  Vietnam ’s
Ministry of Public Security, a  foreign ministry  spokeswoman told
Bloomberg News in a faxed response to questions today.  Vietnam asked Interpol to issue search warrants for Ho Ngoc Tung, former finance general director of Vinashin, and Giang Kim
Dat, a former head of business at Vinashin unit Vien Duong
Transport, for “intentionally violating state regulations on
economic management, causing severe consequences,” spokeswoman
Nguyen Phuong Nga wrote.  The two are suspected to be overseas, Nga said. A warrant
for Tung was issued Mar. 11, and one for Dat was issued in
November, Nga said.  The Hanoi-based company almost collapsed with debts of 86
trillion dong as of June last year, the government said Aug. 4.
The debt may have been as high as 96.7 trillion dong as of Dec.
2009, Lao Dong Newspaper reported June 2, citing a Government
Inspectorate audit.  The government has arrested at least five people, including
the group’s ex-chairman, as it investigates financial
mismanagement at the state-owned shipbuilder.  --Nick Heath in Hanoi. Editor: Rebecca Evans, Andrew Hobbs  To contact the reporter on this story:
