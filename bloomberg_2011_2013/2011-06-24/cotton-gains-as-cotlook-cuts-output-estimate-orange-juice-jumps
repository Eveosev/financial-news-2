Cotton rose the most in a week after
Cotlook Ltd. lowered its outlook for global production.  Orange
juice  gained.  World cotton output will be 2.7 percent lower than
previously forecast at 26.73 million metric tons, the
Birkenhead, England-based researcher said yesterday, citing
“continuing drought in major cotton tracts” in the U.S., the
world’s biggest exporter.  Adverse weather is hurting output “not just in west
Texas,” the top U.S. grower, said John Flanagan, the president
of Flanagan Trading Corp. in Fuquay-Varina,  North Carolina .
“It’s across the South -- Alabama and Georgia,” the second-
biggest producer.  Cotton for December delivery rose 2.52 cents, or 2.1
percent, to settle at $1.2192 a pound at 2:36 p.m. on ICE
Futures U.S. in New York. The fiber still lost 1.5 percent this
week, the third straight drop.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery climbed 5.55
cents, or 3 percent, to settle at $1.9265 a pound on ICE. The
commodity, which gained 8.1 percent this week, reached $1.937
today, the highest since March 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
