Turkish banks rose, sending the
benchmark gauge for lenders to the highest level in almost two
weeks, after JPMorgan Chase & Co. said the industry’s ratings
may improve after the third quarter and valuations are “looking
appealing” following recent losses.  The banking index added 1.4 percent to 128,855.1 by the
5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the
country biggest lender by market value, jumped 1.1 percent to
7.34 liras.  “We would be adding to Turkish exposure near current  price
levels ,” analysts led by Paul Formanko in  London  wrote in a
report on banks in central and eastern  Europe , the  Middle East 
and  Africa . The brokerage kept its “overweight” rating on
Turkish banks on a “long-term view,” recommending Garanti,
Yapi & Kredi Bankasi AS and  Turkiye Halk Bankasi AS. (HALKB)   The central bank has lifted  reserve requirements  for
lenders four times since December by a total of 10 percentage
points, helping damp earnings outlooks and fuel a 10 percent
drop in the banking index this year. That compares with a 6
percent drop in the broader  ISE National 100 Index. (XU100)  Banks make
up about 40 percent of the ISE 100 gauge, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Turkish banking underperformance has been due to
“uncertainty” over central bank measures to tackle loan growth
that’s helping to drive up the current-account deficit,
according to JPMorgan. Share price performance “will remain
volatile over the second and third quarters as the markets focus
on margin evolution and central bank policy measures,” it said.  Earnings Rebound  Earnings per share will probably decline 11 percent this
year, followed by a 19 percent increase in 2012 and 21 percent
gain in 2013, Formanko wrote in the report. Price estimates for
banks were lowered to reflect “the full impact from regulatory,
administrative measures and market trends,” he said.  Halkbank advanced 2.6 percent to 11.65 liras today, and
Yapi Kredi gained 1.8 percent to 3.96 liras. JPMorgan cut its
price estimate for Halkbank to 15 liras from 16 liras and
lowered Yapi Kredi’s estimate to 4.9 liras from 6.4 liras.  JPMorgan cut  Turkiye Is Bankasi (ISCTR)  AS to “underweight” from
“neutral,” and  Asya Katilim Bankasi AS (ASYAB)  to “neutral” from
“overweight,” citing “limited upside potential” from revised
estimates, according to the report. Isbank’s price estimate was
reduced to 5.1 liras from 6.1 liras, while the projection for
Akbank was raised to 7.5 liras from 7.4 liras.  Akbank gained 1.9 percent to 7.54 liras, and Isbank added
0.6 percent to 4.84 liras.  The ISE National 100 Index rose for a second day, rising
0.8 percent to 62,072.64.  To contact the reporter on this story:
