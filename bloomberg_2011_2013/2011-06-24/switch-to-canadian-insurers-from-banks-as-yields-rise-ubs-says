Canadian equity investors should
switch to insurers from banks in preparation for an increase in
bond yields, says George Vasic, a strategist at UBS AG.  Vasic and Garry Cooper, another Toronto-based strategist
for  Switzerland ’s largest bank, substituted  Manulife Financial
Corp. (MFC) ,  North America ’s fourth-largest insurer, for Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce,  Canada ’s fifth-biggest lender by
assets, in their 12-stock model portfolio, reporting the change
in a note to clients.  “With bond yields expected to rise from current low
levels, we add exposure to insurance, which has a positive
correlation to rising yields,” Vasic wrote.  An gauge of banks in the Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite
Index has returned 18 percent including dividends in the four
years ending yesterday as the yield on the Canadian 10-year
government bond fell to 2.9 percent from 4.66 percent. The
S&P/TSX Insurance Index dropped 33 percent with dividends during
the period.  The bond yield will climb to 3.71 percent by the fourth
quarter, according to the median of 19 economists’ estimates in
a Bloomberg survey.  Vasic also added  Magna International Inc. (MG) , Canada’s largest
auto-parts maker, and  Thomson Reuters Corp. (TRI) , the financial news
and information provider, to the stock list, saying their shares
cost less relative to earnings than those of their peers.
Canadian Tire Corp. and  Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL)  were cut from the
portfolio.  To contact the reporter on this story:
