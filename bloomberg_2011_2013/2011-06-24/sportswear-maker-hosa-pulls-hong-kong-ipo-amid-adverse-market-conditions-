Hosa International Ltd., a
sportswear maker, said it won’t proceed with its planned  Hong
Kong  initial public offering because of “adverse market
conditions” and volatility.  China Outfitters Holdings Ltd. is also likely to shelve its
planned listing, Hong Kong’s South China Morning Post newspaper
said today, citing an unidentified person. The company didn’t
immediately respond to an e-mail after normal business hours,
and has no phone number on its website or listed with Hong Kong
directory inquiries.  Xing Yuan Power Holdings Co. also said yesterday morning
that it won’t proceed with an initial sale because of market
conditions. The city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index  entered a so-
called correction last week, dropping more than 10 percent from
its April high.  Hosa will refund application money paid by investors on
June 29, according to a filing to the city’s stock exchange
yesterday. Hosa had planned to sell 400 million shares for as
much as HK$4.10 each, the company said on June 17.  China Outfitters had planned to raise as much as HK$2.33
billion ($299 million) selling 931.8 million shares in the range
of HK$1.90 to HK$2.50 each, according to a June 20 filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
