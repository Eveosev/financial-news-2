Burkina Faso  is considering changing
its constitution after a series of army mutinies and protests
against the government, said Bongnessan Arsene Ye, the minister
of political and parliamentary reforms.  The government has set up a 68-member committee to consider
the changes, he told reporters yesterday in Ouagadougou, the
capital.  The opposition said it would boycott the committee on
concern it will extend presidential limits, allowing President
Blaise Compaore to serve a fifth term in office after elections
in 2015.  Burkina Faso  has been wracked by army protests this
year over delayed pay and allowances, including a mutiny in the
evening of April 14 that forced Compaore to flee the capital.  “After several working sessions, opposition leaders
decided not to send any representatives,” Benewende Stanislas
Sankara, an opposition politician, said in an e-mailed statement
yesterday. The committee may “weaken rather than strengthen our
democratic process.”  Six soldiers and one girl were killed in the town of Bobo
Dioulasso during a military operation to crush a mutiny in an
army base, Safety Minister Jerome Bougouma said on June 5.  Burkina Faso is  Africa ’s biggest cotton producer and one of
the continent’s poorest countries, with gross domestic product
per capita of $517, about half the average rate for the
continent, according to the  World Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
