Shui On Land Ltd. (272) , which developed
the Xintiandi restaurant and bar district from century-old homes
in Shanghai nine years ago, plans to replicate the concept near
the city’s smaller airport and high-speed rail station.  The Hongqiao Tiandi project will include offices, shops,
restaurants, a cultural center and a luxury hotel, Chief
Executive Officer Freddy Lee said. The Shanghai-based company
paid 3.2 billion yuan ($494 million) for the site and the
280,000-square-meter (3 million-square-foot) project is expected
to be completed in two to three years.  “High-speed train stations will be a good development
opportunity in future given so many successful cases in other
cities” including  Hong Kong ,  London  and  New York , Lee said in
an interview in  Singapore  on June 22, declining to give more
information ahead of an announcement for the project next week.  Shui On, which is controlled by Hong Kong billionaire
Vincent Lo, is developing the project as the Chinese government
plans to spend 2.8 trillion yuan on railways by 2015 that will
boost the network to about 120,000 kilometers, according to the
railway ministry. Hongqiao’s transportation hub has 1 million
people passing through in a location where 75 million are within
an hour’s train ride, according to the company.  The stock rose 2.5 percent to HK$3.23 at the close in Hong
Kong trading, the biggest advance in more than two months.  Heaven and Earth  Xintiandi , which means New Heaven and Earth in Chinese, is
a residential and commercial complex built through the
redevelopment of houses dating back to the 19th and 20th
centuries. The project attracted local and international
retailers and restaurants, including Paulaner Brahaus and
Starbucks Corp.  Shui On Land will double the size of the original Xintiandi
and surrounding Taipingqiao development to 120,000 square meters
within the next five to six years, said Lee, 49, who was
promoted as CEO in March, replacing Lo, who remains as chairman.  The company also has Tiandi projects planned for less
affluent Chinese cities such as Wuhan and Chongqing, Lee said.  Shui On Land had 11.6 million square meters of land
holdings at the end of 2010 for its various developments, with
about 70 percent of the sites in less affluent cities, Lee said.  --Bonnie Cao. Editors: Linus Chua, Andreea Papuc  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
