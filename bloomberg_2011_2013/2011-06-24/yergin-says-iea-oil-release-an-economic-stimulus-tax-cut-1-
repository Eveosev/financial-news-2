The  International Energy Agency ’s
planned release of oil from reserves is being used as an
economic stimulus measure that will serve as a “tax cut” for
consumers if it’s successful in driving down prices, according
to a report today from IHS-Cambridge Energy Research Associates.  The release from emergency stockpiles of 60 million barrels
of oil, or 2 million barrels a day for 30 days beginning next
week, follows a disruption in supplies from Libya and could
boost both consumer spending power and confidence, according to
IHS-CERA’s  Daniel Yergin  and James Burkhard.  “Although  oil prices  have come down since Brent reached
$126 per barrel in April, worries about the potential for
another economic slowdown have grown,” the report said. “The
oil release signals that IEA members are taking into account the
broader macroeconomic environment to decide on using strategic
reserves.”  Oil for August delivery declined 25 cents to $90.77 a
barrel at 2:04 p.m. on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices
have fallen 2.8 percent this week and gained 19 percent in the
past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
