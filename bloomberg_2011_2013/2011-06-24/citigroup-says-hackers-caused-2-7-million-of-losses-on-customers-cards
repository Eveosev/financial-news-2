Citigroup Inc. (C) , the third-largest
U.S. bank, said about 3,400 customers lost about $2.7 million
when their credit-card information was breached by hackers
earlier this year.  The customers will be reimbursed,  Sean Kevelighan , a
spokesman for the New York-based bank, said in a phone interview
today. It’s the first public acknowledgement by
Citigroup that the incident resulted in any financial losses.  Citigroup said earlier this month more than 360,000 credit-
card accounts, or 1.5 percent of the bank’s total in  North
America , may have been compromised by hackers in May. The Wall
Street Journal reported the amount of the loss earlier today.  “Citi immediately rectified the data breach upon
discovery, while also placing internal fraud alerts and
monitoring on all accounts at risk,” Kevelighan said in an e-
mail earlier this month. “Simultaneously, we began analysis to
determine the precise accounts and type of information
accessed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
