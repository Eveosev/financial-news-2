Treasury 10-year note yields will
climb to around 4 percent in the next year as U.S. economic
growth accelerates, according to  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S.
interest strategy at  RBC Capital Markets .  “We think that the economy has slowed down a bit, but 10-
years through 3 percent is pricing for a dramatic slowdown,”
Cloherty said during an interview on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene . “That’s extreme
weakness, real double-dip recessionary threat. We don’t think
we’re going to get there.”  The Commerce Department said today that the economy grew at
a 1.9 percent pace in the first quarter, marking the start of
what Federal Reserve policy makers project is a temporary
slowdown in growth. Fed officials said June 22 that the economy
will expand 2.7 percent to 2.9 percent this year, down from
forecasts ranging from 3.1 percent to 3.3 percent in April.  Yields on 10-year notes fell 4 basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 2.87 percent at 4:09 p.m. in  New York ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The yield touched
2.85 percent, the lowest level since Dec. 1.  The 10-year note’s yield will reach 4 percent by June 2012,
according to the median of 64 forecasters in a Bloomberg News
survey. The last time the security touched 4 percent was April
2010.  Falling oil prices will help  consumer spending  overcome a
month of “bad data” and the U.S. will expand enough that 3
percent yields will not be justified, Cloherty said.  The  International Energy Agency  decided yesterday to
release 60 million barrels of oil stockpiles in an effort to
drive down the price of crude oil and spur global economic
growth. Crude oil for August delivery reached a four-month low
in London trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
