Commodities fell for a third day on
concern that  Europe ’s widening debt woes and a slowing U.S.
economy will curb the pace of global growth, eroding demand for
raw materials.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 commodities
dropped 0.1 percent to settle at 329.89 at 4:47 p.m. in New
York, led by corn, gasoline and gold. The grain declined as much
as 2.8 percent in Chicago as warm weather aids U.S. crops.  “The market is worried about the European debt crisis,”
said  Michael Smith , the president of T&K Futures and Options
Inc. Port St. Lucie, Florida. “The  Federal Reserve  cut its
forecast for U.S. growth. China is showing signs of a slowdown.
Commodities will probably trade sideways to down through the
summer.”  U.S. equities fell as banks dragged on Europe’s benchmark
index, after Moody’s Investors Service said it may downgrade 13
Italian lenders. Fed governors and regional-bank presidents cut
their growth forecast for this year and next on June 22 as
unemployment hovers around 9 percent.  The CRB index has dropped 11 percent since reaching 370.72
on May 2, the highest level since September 2008, as
manufacturing slowed in  China , the world’s largest consumer of
raw materials, including metals, pork, wheat and cotton. The
index capped a third straight weekly decline, the longest slump
since May 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
