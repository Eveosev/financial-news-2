Asia jet fuel and gasoil dropped to
the lowest in four months after the  International Energy Agency 
announced its plan to release emergency oil stockpiles. Naphtha
rose to the highest in a week on speculation the consuming
countries’ decision will bolster the global economic recovery.  Middle Distillates  July swaps for gasoil slid $4, or 3.2 percent, to $119.85 a
barrel at 10:51 a.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a London-based crude and refined-products
broker. Prices have fallen 4.8 percent this week and are the
lowest since Feb. 22.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or the regrade, were at 95
cents a barrel from $1.15 on June 17. Jet fuel swaps were at
$120.80 a barrel, the lowest since Feb. 18.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude, a measure of processing
profit for the fuel, fell $2.85, or 14 percent, to $16.95 a
barrel, the biggest weekly decline since Nov. 13, 2009.  The U.S. and 27 allies will release emergency oil
stockpiles through the International Energy Agency for the third
time in more than three decades as the war in  Libya  chokes
global supplies.  The release of 60 million barrels, or 2 million barrels a
day of oil over 30 days from the end of next week, will be
coordinated by the IEA, the Paris-based agency said June 23 in a
statement.  Light Distillates  July swaps for naphtha rose $2.25, or 0.2 percent, to
$934.50 a ton today, PVM data showed. Prices are at the highest
since June 16 and have risen 0.2 percent this week.  The crack spread, a measure of the refining margin for
processing  Brent crude  into the petrochemical feedstock, was at
$121.81 a ton from $95.19 a ton at 5:30 p.m. Singapore time
yesterday, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The crack
was at $77.85 at the end of Asian trading on June 17.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 99 cents, or 15
percent this week to $5.78 a ton, PVM data showed.  High-sulfur fuel-oil swaps fell $17.25, or 2.7 percent, to
$631.25 a ton today, and declined 2.3 percent this week, PVM
data showed. The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-
centistoke grade shrank $1.50 to $10 a ton this week. The
narrower spread indicates marine fuel-oil prices fell less than
the grades used at  power plants .  To contact the reporter on this story:
