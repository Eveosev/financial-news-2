Berkeley Group Holdings Plc (BKG) , the
U.K.’s largest homebuilder by market value, rose the most in
almost three years in  London  trading after saying it will pay
shareholders dividends of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.7 billion) over
the next decade.  Berkeley advanced 11 percent, the biggest increase since
July 2008, to 1,254 pence at the 4:30 p.m. close in London.
Investors will receive three dividends totaling 13 pounds a
share by 2021, the Cobham, England-based company said in a
statement today.  The plan is part of Berkeley’s strategy to limit risk by
minimizing the size of the company. Berkeley abandoned high-
volume homebuilding in 2004 and concentrated on houses rather
than apartments in urban areas. It also focused on London and
the southeast  England , where the recovery in  house prices  has
been the strongest.  “You want to keep a natural size and manage risk over the
cycle,” Managing Director Rob Perrins said in a telephone
interview. “If it’s right to do so, we’ll shrink the business
right back again at any time or shrink the land bank back.”  Net income increased to 95.1 million pounds in the 12
months through April from 79.7 million pounds a year earlier,
the company said in the statement. The average estimate from a
Bloomberg survey of five analysts was for profit of about 95
million pounds.  “The surprise in today’s announcement is that the company
is now confident in the sustainability of the market, and this
should benefit all the housebuilders’ shares, especially those
with decent London and South East exposure,”  Liberum Capital 
wrote in a note today.  Biggest Gain  Berkeley shares have gained 41 percent this year, giving it
a market value of 1.65 billion pounds. That compares with an 18
percent rise in the Bloomberg EMEA Homebuilders Index, which
advanced 4 percent today.  Investors will receive 4.34 pounds a share on 30 September
2015 and two further payments of 4.33 pounds will follow in
September 2018 and 2021, the company said.  In 2008, the company deferred a 3-pound payout to investors
to build up cash and take advantage of falling land values amid
Britain’s biggest housing slump in 25 years.  “We’re not an EPS growth model at all,” Perrins said.
“It’s a lower-risk model to optimize returns to shareholders.
We can manage the risk of a cyclical market. The market is very
volatile.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
