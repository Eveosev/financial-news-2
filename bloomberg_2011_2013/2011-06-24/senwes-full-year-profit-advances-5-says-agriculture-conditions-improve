Senwes Ltd., a South African grain-
storage company, said fiscal full-year profit rose 5 percent and
that trading conditions in the agricultural industry have
improved “dramatically.”  Net income increased to 219 million rand in the 12 months
through April compared with 209 million rand a year earlier,
Senwes said in a statement published in Johannesburg-based
Business Day newspaper today. Revenue declined to 7.55 billion
rand from 9.04 billion rand a year earlier, it said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
