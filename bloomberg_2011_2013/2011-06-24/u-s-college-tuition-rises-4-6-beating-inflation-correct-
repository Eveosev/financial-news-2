(Corrects student aid data in fourth paragraph in a story
published June 23.)  Tuition and fees at private,
nonprofit U.S. colleges and universities for the 2011-2012
academic year will rise an average of 4.6 percent, exceeding
inflation, according to a survey of 429 institutions.  Tuition hikes have hovered in the mid-four percent range
over the last three years, according to the Washington-based
 National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities .
U.S. consumer prices rose at an annual 3.6 percent in May.  An increase in financial need, employee health care,
information technology and utilities contributed to rising
tuition, the association said in a  statement . During the decade
prior to the global financial crisis that began in 2008, the
average tuition increase was 6 percent.  Student aid will grow an average of 7 percent, up from a
6.8 percent increase last year, the association said. In light
of the economic downturn, private colleges have aimed to
increase student aid while slowing tuition increases, David L.
Warren, the associationâ€™s president, said in the statement.  Published tuition and fees for the 2010-2011 academic year
averaged $27,293, according to the  College Board , a nonprofit
research and advocacy group based in  New York . After grant aid
and federal tax benefits are considered, average net tuition and
fees for full-time students was $11,320.  To contact the reporter on this story:
