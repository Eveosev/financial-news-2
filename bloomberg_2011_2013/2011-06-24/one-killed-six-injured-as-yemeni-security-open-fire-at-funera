One person was killed and six
injured when Yemeni security forces opened fire at a funeral
gathering in the Yemeni city of Aden, eyewitness Fawaz Sharabi
said.  Army and police fired at thousands of people carrying the
body of Ahmed al-Darwish, who was killed in June last year,
Sharabi said by phone from Aden. Darwish was arrested last year
during a protest by Yemeni separatists in the south. He died
during custody and his body was retained as evidence of torture.  In Sanaa, tens of thousands protested demanding the
establishment of a transitional council to run the country and
the removal of the remaining family members of President Ali Abdullah Saleh.  Saleh is in neighbouring  Saudi Arabia  recovering from
injuries sustained in a June 3 attack on his compound. Yemenâ€™s
Vice President Abed Rabbo Mansur Hadi said June 18 that Saleh
was in good health and will return to the country soon after
treatment in the kingdom.  Protestors, demanding the ouster of Saleh, today denounced
foreign interference in Yemen and chanted they will demonstrate
until the fall of all entities related to the regime.  To contact the reporter on this story:
