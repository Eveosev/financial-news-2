Conrad Black , the former Hollinger
International Inc. chairman and chief executive officer, faces
additional prison time after being resentenced for mail fraud
and obstructing justice, the surviving convictions from his 2007
trial.  A new sentence of 3 1/2 years was imposed today by U.S.
District Judge Amy J. St. Eve in Chicago. He already served two
years and four months before being freed on bail during his
appeals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
