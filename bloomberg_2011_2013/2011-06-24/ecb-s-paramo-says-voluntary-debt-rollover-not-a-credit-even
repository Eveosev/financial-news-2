European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said a “decentralized,
voluntary” Greek debt rollover agreement should not be
considered a “ credit event .”  Asked if the ECB would continue accepting Greek debt as
collateral even if  credit rating agencies  do consider such an
agreement to be a credit event, he said the bank “will see.”  “The only thing I can say is that we can only lend to
lenders that are solvent against collateral that is appropriate
according to our statutes,” Gonzalez-Paramo told reporters in
Malaga, Spain, today. “We will see at the time what the
situation is.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
