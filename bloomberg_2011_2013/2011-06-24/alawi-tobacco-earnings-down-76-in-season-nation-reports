Malawiâ€™s tobacco earnings dropped 76
percent in the first 13 weeks of sales compared with the same
period a year earlier, the Nation newspaper reported today,
citing a Tobacco Control Commission report.  Earnings fell to $49.6 million from $208 million earned
last year after 13 weeks, the Blantyre-based newspaper said.  The southern African nation has sold 51.1 million kilograms
(113 million pounds) of the leaves from 105.2 million kilograms
during the same period last year, the newspaper said.  The government plans to regulate tobacco production as one
way of helping improve prices and quality of the leaves, the
Nation cited Agriculture Minister Peter Mwanza as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
