The Australian dollar fell to within
half a cent of a one-month low versus its U.S. counterpart as
concern that a Greek austerity plan won’t resolve  Europe ’s
sovereign-debt crisis damped appetite for higher yields.  The  New Zealand dollar  capped a second weekly loss, its
first back-to-back five-day decline in more than a month, and
the Aussie fell for the week. Stocks and commodities declined as
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  prepared for a vote in
parliament next week on budget cuts and asset sales needed to
secure funding from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund and keep Greece from defaulting on its debt.  “Anything that starts with a “G” I’ll be paying
attention to,” said Carl Forcheski, a director on the corporate
currency sales desk at Societe Generale SA in New York.
“Developments in  Greece  are really what the market’s all about
right now, including Australia.”  The Australian dollar weakened 0.2 percent to $1.0503 at
2:55 p.m. in New York, from $1.0523 yesterday, when it touched
$1.0455, the lowest since May 25. It tumbled 1.1 percent on the
week. The Aussie slipped 0.2 percent to 84.53 yen, from 84.72.  New Zealand’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, fell 0.4 percent
to 81.06 U.S. cents, from 81.39 cents yesterday. It declined 0.3
percent on the week. The kiwi depreciated 0.5 percent to 65.21
yen, from 65.53 yesterday.  The Aussie tempered its losses as a central-bank official
said the country’s biggest mining boom in a century risks
accelerating inflation.  “We are looking at a significant boom in investment in the
resources sector at a time when the overall economy has
relatively little spare capacity,”  Reserve Bank  of Australia
Assistant Governor  Philip Lowe  said in a speech at a BankSA
Trends forum in Adelaide, Australia. He didn’t specifically
address monetary policy.  RBA Governor  Glenn Stevens  held the benchmark rate at 4.75
percent this month for a sixth straight meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
