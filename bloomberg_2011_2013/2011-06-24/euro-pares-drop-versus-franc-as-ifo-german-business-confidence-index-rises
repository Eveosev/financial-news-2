The euro pared declines against the
dollar and the Swiss franc after the Ifo instituteâ€™s business
climate index unexpectedly rose in June.  The 17-nation currency was 0.2 percent weaker at $1.4234 as
of 9:02 a.m. in  London  after dropping as much as 0.4 percent. It
was also 0.2 percent down versus the Swiss franc, at 1.19313,
having fallen as much as 0.6 percent.  The Ifo index of German business confidence increased to
114.5 from 114.2 in May. Economists had forecast a drop to
113.4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
