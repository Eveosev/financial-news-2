(Corrects timing of previous plan in second paragraph.)  Japan Tobacco Inc. (2914)  may restore
shipments of all products sooner than previously planned,
Mitsuomi Koizumi, executive deputy president, said today at
the annual shareholders meeting.  The cigarette maker had said it would restore deliveries
of all products by early August after some output was
disrupted by the March 11 earthquake.  To contact the reporter on this story:
