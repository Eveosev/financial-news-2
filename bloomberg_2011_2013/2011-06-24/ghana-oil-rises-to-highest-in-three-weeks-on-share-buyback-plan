Ghana Oil Co., the second-biggest
operator of gasoline stations in the West African nation, rose
to the highest in almost three weeks as the company plans to buy
back as much as 15 percent of its issued shares this year.  The stock gained 1 pesewa, or 3.2 percent, to 32 pesewas as
of 1:54 p.m. in the capital, Accra, the highest since June 6.  The company also known as Goil will buy and hold the stock
as and when it deems prudent, Chairman William Asomaning said at
a  shareholders’ meeting  yesterday.  “The plan will stabilize the shares, and any investor will
gain when they own the shares before the company should start
the buyback,” Randy Mensah, a stock trader at  Databank
Financial Services Ltd. , said in a telephone interview today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
