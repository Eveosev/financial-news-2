Guangxi Royal Dairy Co. rose the
most in more than seven months in Shenzhen trading after
announcing an agreement to buy a 55 percent stake in a producer
of yogurt and milk based in southwestern  China .  Royal Dairy rose by the 10 percent daily limit to 17.80
yuan in Shenzhen, the biggest one-day increase since November.
China’s benchmark Shanghai Composite Index gained 2.2 percent.  Royal Dairy agreed to pay 97.8 million yuan ($15.1 million)
for the stake in Dalilaisier Dairy Ltd., which is based in the
province of Yunnan. The acquisition is being made as part of
Royal Dairy’s efforts to increase sales outside Guangxi province,
where the company is based, according to a statement filed to
Shenzhen’s stock exchange.  Dalilaisier Dairy , which sells products using the Lesson
brand name, had 117 million yuan of sales and 5.27 million yuan
of net income last year, according to the Royal Dairy statement.  To contact the editors responsible for this story:
