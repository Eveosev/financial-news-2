Inpex Corp. (1605) , the Japanese energy
company planning the Ichthys liquefied natural gas project in
 Australia , agreed to supply fuel from the venture to Chubu
Electric Power Co., Toho Gas Co. and CPC Corp.  Inpex is close to completing talks with five “major”
Japanese utilities for further LNG sales, the Tokyo-based
company said today in a statement. The company expects to sell
all of the 8.4 million metric tons of LNG a year that will be
produced at the Ichthys project in northern Australia, it said.  Ichthys is among more than a dozen proposed LNG
developments in Australia seeking to tap rising Asian demand for
less-polluting alternatives to coal. Inpex and its partner,
Paris-based Total SA, aim to make a final  investment decision  in
the fourth quarter, the company said.  Australian Environment Minister Tony Burke expects to
decide whether to approve the project by July 7, the nation’s
environment department said earlier this month. The Northern
Territory government cleared the venture last month.  Inpex plans to sell 490,000 tons of LNG a year to Chubu
Electric, 280,000 tons a year to Toho Gas and 1.75 million tons
a year to CPC of Taiwan, it said today. The accords are for 15
years starting from 2017. Inpex and Total will take a total of
1.8 million tons annually.  Inpex expects to sell all of the LNG volume when the
negotiations with the Japanese utilities finish, with a “large
part” of the supplies going to  Japan , the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
