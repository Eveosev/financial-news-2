Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  advanced 24.91 points, or 0.7
percent, to 3,848.56. The gauge has increased 3.4 percent this
week, the largest rally since the period ended Oct. 1.  PT Adaro Energy (ADRO IJ),  Indonesia ’s second-largest coal
producer, rose 1.1 percent to 2,375 rupiah, the biggest boost to
the Jakarta Mining Index. Citigroup Inc. said in a report
yesterday the company “appears on track to meet our above-
consensus” output estimates for 2011 and its production could
“surprise on the upside.”  PT Astra International (ASII IJ), Indonesia’s largest auto
retailer, advanced 1.8 percent to 61,900 rupiah, the highest
close since May 20. The shares rose amid speculation its vehicle
production will recover next month following disruptions caused
by the March earthquake in  Japan , according to Hariyanto Wijaya,
an analyst at PT Mandiri Sekuritas.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ),  Asia ’s biggest exporter of
power-station coal, fell 2.3 percent to 3,125 rupiah. Crude oil
futures in  New York  slumped 4.6 percent to $91.02 a barrel
yesterday, erasing its gains for the year, before increasing as
much as 1.5 percent today. A lower oil price cuts the appeal of
alternative fuels such as coal.  PT Garuda Indonesia (GIAA IJ), Indonesia’s largest airline,
rose 3.9 percent to 540 rupiah, the highest since May 31, after
oil futures plunged yesterday, reducing the risk of higher fuel
costs for the carrier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
