India  raised diesel and cooking gas
prices for the first time in a year to reduce losses at state-
owned refiners and narrow its budget deficit to a four-year low.  A panel of Indian ministers, led by Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee, allowed refiners including Indian Oil Corp., the
nation’s biggest, to increase diesel prices by 3 rupees (7 cents)
a liter, kerosene by 2 rupees a liter and cooking gas by 50
rupees for every 14.2 kilogram bottle, Oil Minister S. Jaipal Reddy said in New Delhi yesterday. The tariffs don’t take into
account the taxes imposed by state governments, he said.  Higher fuel costs will accelerate inflation in  Asia ’s
second-largest energy consumer, where diesel and cooking-fuel
prices are capped to protect the livelihoods of 75 percent of
the population the  World Bank  says survives on less than $2 a
day. Inflation in India is already more than twice the rate in
the U.S. and almost four times  Germany ’s.  “I am sandwiched between economists on one side and
populists on the other,” Reddy said. “We have to watch crude
prices, we have to look at other devices” to compensate the
refiners for the remaining revenue loss, estimated to reach 1.2
trillion rupees in the current year ending March 31.  Reddy said the government also removed the 5 percent
customs duty on crude oil, cut the levy on diesel and gasoline
by 5 percentage points, and lowered the excise duty on diesel to
2 rupees a liter from 4.6 rupees a liter. The tax cuts will cost
the government 490 billion rupees, he estimated.  Duty Cuts  “I have taken the risk of reducing the duties so that
relief can be given to consumers,” Mukherjee told reporters in
 New Delhi  yesterday.  Shares of state refiners rose in Mumbai trading yesterday.
Indian Oil gained 2.5 percent to 336.90 rupees, compared with a
2.9 percent gain in the benchmark Sensitive Index. Bharat
Petroleum Corp. increased 2.8 percent to 634.70 rupees, while
Hindustan Petroleum Corp. advanced 6.1 percent to 392.60 rupees.
State-run Oil & Natural Gas Corp., which bears part of the
refiners’ subsidy burden, rose 3.1 percent to 272.80 rupees.  India last raised prices of diesel, kerosene and cooking
gas on June 26 last year. High food prices and provincial
elections prevented Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s government
from boosting prices of the fuel that is used to run everything
from trucks and water pumps to electricity-generator sets.  Rising Prices  India’s inflation accelerated to 9.06 percent in May. An
index measuring wholesale prices of agricultural products rose
to a two-month high of 9.13 percent in the week ended June 11
from a year earlier, the commerce ministry said June 23.  Diesel has a 4.7 percent weighting in India’s benchmark
wholesale-price index and gasoline 1.1 percent.  Oil for August delivery rose 14 cents to $91.16 a barrel on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  yesterday. The August contract
is down 2.4 percent this week. Crude oil in New York trading
increased 17 percent since June 28, 2010.  China , the world’s fastest-growing major economy, raised
diesel prices by 400 yuan ($62) a metric ton, or 0.34 yuan a
liter, on April 7, the fourth increase since Oct. 26 last year,
according to data on the National Development and Reform
Commission website.  On May 15, Indian Oil boosted the price of gasoline by 5
rupees a liter to 63.37 rupees, the biggest increase since June
2008.  State refiners were losing 4.6 billion rupees a day by
selling diesel, kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas below cost,
the petroleum ministry said before yesterday’s announcement. The
government gives the refiners cash to compensate part of the
losses.  Mukherjee, in his Feb. 28 budget, estimated a spending of
236.4 billion rupees on fuel subsidies in the year to March 31,
less than the 383.8 billion rupees spent in the previous 12
months.  India aims to narrow the  budget deficit  to 4.6 percent of
gross domestic product in the current fiscal year through March,
from 4.7 percent of gross domestic product in the previous 12
months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
