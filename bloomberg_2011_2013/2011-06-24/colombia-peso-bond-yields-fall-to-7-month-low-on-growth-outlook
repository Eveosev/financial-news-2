Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to an almost seven-month low, after the nation’s economy
expanded more than forecast in the first quarter.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due July 2024 fell
five basis points, or 0.05 percentage point, to 7.76 percent at
10:21 a.m. New York time, according to Colombia’s stock
exchange. That’s its lowest level on a closing basis since Dec.
6. The security’s price rose 0.520 centavo to 118.059 centavos
per peso.  “Colombia’s economy is doing well, fundamentals are strong
and bonds are incorporating the positive news,” said Gustavo
Sorzano, an analyst at Bogota-based Helm Bank SA.  A government report yesterday showed Colombia’s gross
domestic product rose 5.1 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier. Analysts expected growth of 4.8 percent, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Fitch Ratings  raised Colombia’s credit rating this week to
BBB-, the agency’s lowest investment grade, matching earlier
moves by  Standard & Poor’s  and Moody’s Investors Service as
economic growth accelerates and after Congress passed laws that
seek to cut the nation’s budget deficit.  Colombia’s peso rose as European Union leaders voiced
support to help  Greece  avoid default and durable goods orders
rose more than estimated in the U.S., the world’s biggest
economy.  The peso advanced 0.2 percent to 1,783.20 per dollar from
1,787.53 yesterday. It has gained 0.4 percent this week and 6.9
percent this year, the best performer among the six most-traded
Latin American currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  “Things are a bit calmer today in external markets,
leading to some risk appetite,” said Sorzano.  To contact the reporter on this story:
