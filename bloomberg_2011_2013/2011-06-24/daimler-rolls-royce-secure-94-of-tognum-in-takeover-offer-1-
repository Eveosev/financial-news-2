Daimler AG (DAI)  and  Rolls-Royce Group Plc (RR/) 
secured 94 percent of  Tognum AG (TGM)  after a sweetened bid attracted
investors to the offer that values the German engine maker at
about 3.4 billion euros ($4.8 billion).  A total of 123.7 million shares were tendered in the offer
that ended on June 20, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said
today in a statement. Daimler and Rolls-Royce will probably
complete the transaction in the third quarter after regulatory
clearance, it said.  Tognum, which is based in Friedrichshafen, is the world’s
second-biggest manufacturer of high-speed  diesel engines  for the
marine, energy and defense industries, after  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) 
London-based Rolls-Royce, whose engines power Airbus SAS and
Boeing Co. planes, plans to sell Tognum its Bergen business,
which makes engines for ships and power generators, to compete
with Caterpillar.  “We see great potential in this global market worth more
than 30 billion euros a year,” Daimler Chief Financial Officer
Bodo Uebber said in the statement. “We are very pleased with
the final acceptance rate.”  Raised Bid Price  Daimler and Rolls-Royce, which are 50-50 partners in the
transaction, stoked investor interest by raising the offer 8.3
percent to 26 euros a share on May 16, after Tognum rejected the
initial bid as too low. The shareholder acceptance of the bid
far exceeds the buyers’ threshold of 30 percent, which was
lowered from 50 percent when the offer was increased.  Tognum rose as much as 39 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 25.93
euros and was up 1.2 percent at 9:55 a.m. in  Frankfurt , valuing
the company at 3.4 billion euros.  The engine manufacturer was formerly a unit of Daimler. The
maker of Mercedes-Benz cars and trucks sold Tognum, then called
MTU Friedrichshafen, for 1.6 billion euros to Stockholm-based
private equity firm EQT Partners in March 2006 to help pay for
reorganizing Chrysler, the U.S. carmaker it owned at the time.  After Tognum’s initial public offering, Daimler bought a
22 percent stake for 585 million euros in April 2008, raising
the holding to more than 25 percent three months later. Daimler
contributed its 28.4 percent holding in the engine maker as part
of the deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
