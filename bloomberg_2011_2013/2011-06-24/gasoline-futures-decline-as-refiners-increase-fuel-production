Gasoline fell as refiners increased
output of the motor fuel before the July 4 holiday in the U.S.
and as  Brent crude  declined to a four-month low in  London .  Futures sank 2.2 percent after U.S. gasoline output jumped
last week to a 10-month high, Energy Department data showed,
even as demand was expected to slip from a year earlier. The
number of travelers by car during the Independence Day holiday
that starts June 30 will drop 3 percent, AAA said June 22.  “We saw very high gasoline production last week,” said
 Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.
The market also awaits the return of PBF Energy Partners LP’s
Delaware City refinery and Korea National Oil Corp’s Come by
Chance plant in Newfoundland, while  Europe  has offered more fuel
since seasonal maintenance ended, he said.  Gasoline for July delivery slipped 6.1 cents to settle at
$2.7766 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
level since Feb. 28.  Futures dropped as Brent crude traded on the ICE Futures
Europe exchange sank 2% to $105.12 a barrel. Gasoline and
heating oil futures are delivered in New York Harbor. Refiners
in the region primarily use oil from Europe and West Africa,
which are priced versus Brent.  “The idea that the economy starts to sputter casts doubt
on summer driving demand,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and
broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut. “Product
prices are also tracking Brent more closely.”  Fuel Premium  Gasoline and heating oil premiums over crude oil on Nymex
narrowed as Brent crude on dropped more than WTI. The WTI-Brent
spread, based on August futures, slipped to as low as $13.76 a
barrel today, after widening to a record $23.32 June 15.  The gasoline crack spread, based on August contracts, fell
$2.68 to $22.91 a barrel, while the heating oil crack spread
narrowed $1.43 to $25.13.  Regular gasoline at the pump declined 1.1 cents to $3.601
yesterday, according to AAA data on its website. It’s the lowest
level since March 29.  Heating oil for July delivery sank 3.14 cents, or 1.1
percent, to $2.7503 a gallon on the Nymex.  To contact the reporter on this story:
