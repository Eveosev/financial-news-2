A Ukrainian court adjourned until
tomorrow morning a pre-trial hearing into an abuse-of-power case
against former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko .  The hearing, which began at 9 a.m. today, will resume at 10
a.m. tomorrow after opposition leader Tymoshenko requested a
recess, said Judge Rodion Kireyev of the Kiev District Court.
About 150 people filled the courtroom, which is designed to hold
40, local television reported.  Ukrainian prosecutors opened a criminal probe into
Tymoshenko in April over natural-gas contracts her government
signed with Russia in 2009. They say the price Ukraine agreed to
pay was too high, resulting in damage to the country of 1.5
billion hryvnia ($188 million).  Tymoshenko’s lawyer, Serhiy Vlasenko, told the hearing
there is no evidence of wrongdoing since the price paid by
Ukraine is below that paid by other European nations. The former
premier accused President  Viktor Yanukovych  of engineering the
case to silence opposition before next year’s parliamentary
elections.  Tymoshenko has been at odds with Yanukovych since 2004,
when she led the Orange Revolution that overturned his victory
in presidential elections. She was ordered not to leave Ukraine
in December after a separate investigation was opened into
emissions permits issued to  Japan  in 2009.  Judge Kireyev didn’t respond to a request from Vlasenko to
postpone the hearing to July 24 to allow the defense to study
some 220 pages of new documents submitted by prosecutors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
