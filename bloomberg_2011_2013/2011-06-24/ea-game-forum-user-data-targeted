Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS)  said computer
hackers broke into servers that ran a forum for its
“Neverwinter Nights” game and may have stolen personal data
such as passwords, phone numbers and e-mail addresses.  No credit card data was compromised, Electronic Arts said
today on its user-support website. The company is investigating
and has notified users who were potentially affected, it said.  “The server system associated with the ‘‘Neverwinter
Nights’’ forums was the target of a highly sophisticated and
unlawful cyber attack,” Electronic Arts said. “We have moved
swiftly to implement additional security controls to prevent
this type of breach from happening again to secure your data and
are conducting further evaluations now.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
