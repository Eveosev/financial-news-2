Gasoline on the  Gulf Coast 
strengthened as  Valero Energy Corp. (VLO)  scheduled maintenance at its
Corpus Christi West refinery in Texas.  The work in Complex 1 at the 200,000-barrel-a-day plant was
expected to start at 7 a.m. local time today and finish at the
same time tomorrow, according to a filing with the Texas
Commission on Environmental Quality.  “There was no material impact to production associated
with the emissions report at the West Plant,” said  Bill Day , a
spokesman for the company.  The discount for reformulated, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast narrowed 3.95 cents to 0.8 cent a gallon at 3:53
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
slipped 2.15 cents to $2.7686 a gallon.  BP Plc (BP) ’s Texas City, Texas, refinery plans to restart an
ultraformer and ultracracker today, according to separate state
filings. The plant can process 475,000 barrels of crude a day,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The same fuel in New York Harbor dropped 0.25 cent to a
premium of 5.75 cents versus futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
