Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. led
gains among Hong Kong-listed Chinese carmakers after a newspaper
reported the government may ease new-vehicle restrictions aimed
at cutting traffic and pollution.  Guangzhou Automobile increased 8.4 percent to HK$9.14 at
the close of trading in  Hong Kong .  Geely Automobile Holdings
Ltd. (175)  climbed 7.3 percent, Dongfeng Motor Group Co. rose 5.4
percent, BYD Co. advanced 5 percent and  Brilliance China
Automotive Holdings Ltd. (1114)  gained 7.6 percent. The benchmark Hang
Seng Index added 1.9 percent.  The National Development and Reform Commission and other
Chinese agencies want to change or remove the limits on the
number of license plates issued by government, National Business
Daily reported today, citing an unidentified official at the
 China Association of Automobile Manufacturers .  Dong Yang, deputy head of the automakers group, denied
National Business Daily’s report. “There is no such thing,” he
said in a phone interview today.  The limits, imposed this year, mandate 240,000 vehicle
registrations in Beijing for 2011, down from 891,000 last year.  “We don’t expect the government to remove the limits very
soon,” said Stanley Yan, an analyst with Masterlink Securities
Corp. in  Shanghai . He said removing the limits might boost the
stock market in the short term.  China ’s auto sales have slowed this year after surging 32
percent in 2010 to a record. Deliveries of passenger cars fell
for the first time in more than two years in May, as the
government phased out incentives and the May 11 earthquake in
 Japan  disrupted vehicle production, according to the automobile
group.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
