U.S. stocks retreated, trimming a
second straight weekly gain, as Oracle Corp. led technology
shares lower and concern about Italian banks kept  Europe ’s debt
crisis in focus. European shares pared gains, the euro weakened
for a third day and commodities erased an earlier advance.      The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3 percent to
1,279.27, falling for a third straight day and reducing its
weekly gain to 0.6 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index climbed
0.2 percent, paring a 1.2 percent rally, and the euro slumped
0.3 percent to $1.4214. The S&P GSCI Index of commodities was
little changed after a 1.1 percent advance. Ten-year Treasury
yields fell less than one basis point to 2.91 percent.   Technology shares led the S&P 500’s decline after Oracle
reported an unexpected drop in hardware sales, while banks were
the biggest drag on Europe’s benchmark index after Moody’s
Investors Service said it may downgrade 13 Italian lenders.
Declines in the two industry groups overshadowed faster-than-
forecast growth in U.S. durable-goods orders and European
leaders’ pledge to support  Greece  if the nation approves
austerity measures.   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
