Desarrolladora Homex SAB,  Mexico ’s
largest homebuilder, headed for its biggest weekly gain in
almost three months as the company’s valuation relative to other
Mexican stocks draws investors.  Homex rose 3.4 percent to 46.43 pesos in Mexico City
trading at 4 p.m. New York time. It advanced 7.5 percent this
week, the biggest weekly gain since the five days ended April 1.  Mexican homebuilders are trading at a “large discount
compared to the rest of the Mexican market,” Francisco Suarez Savin, an analyst at HSBC, said in a phone interview from Mexico
City. Homex trades at 8.4 times 12-month forward earnings,
compared to Mexico’s IPC index at 14.5 times. Shares have
dropped 48 percent since August 2008.  “Homex is a long-term value play,” Suarez said. “The
recovery in Mexico, in employment,  consumer confidence , provides
a nice setting for homebuilders to keep growing because the
demand is there. And right now, the shares of all homebuilders
are very cheap.”  Corp. Geo SAB, Mexico’s second-largest homebuilder, trades
at 7.9 times 12-month earnings estimates. It gained 2.5 percent
to 26.35 pesos. Consorcio Ara SAB, Mexico’s fourth-largest
homebuilder, trades at 7.6 times forward earnings. It was little
changed 5.61 pesos.  Mexican consumer prices unexpectedly fell 0.05 percent in
the first two weeks of June, the central bank said yesterday.
Economists had forecast a 0.11 percent rise, according to the
median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  HSBC rates Homex, Geo and Ara as “overweight.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
