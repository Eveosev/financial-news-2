Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said the decision by the U.S. to tap oil reserves
should “help reinforce some of the softness” recently seen in
the prices.  The cost of oil “obviously” will come down, Geithner said
today in an interview on CNBC television, declining to predict
the reduction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
