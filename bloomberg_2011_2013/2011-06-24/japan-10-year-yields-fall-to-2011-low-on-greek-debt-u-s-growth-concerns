Japan ’s 10-year yields touched the
lowest level this year on concerns  Greece  will struggle to pass
austerity measures and that the  U.S. economy  is losing momentum.  Japanese bonds headed for a second weekly gain before
European finance chiefs decide on July 3 whether debt-strapped
Greece has met conditions for its next aid payment.  U.S.
Treasuries  rose and stocks dropped yesterday after a Labor
Department report showed initial jobless claims increased to
429,000 in the week ended June 18, from a revised 420,000 the
previous week.  “Concern that the pace of U.S. economic recovery is
slowing and uncertainty whether Greece is able to pass budget
cuts are leading to bond buying,” said Masahide Tanaka, a
senior strategist in  Tokyo  at Mizuho Trust & Banking Co. “The
risk-averse mood in the markets is persistent.”  The 10-year yield dropped half a basis point to 1.100
percent as of 9:36 a.m. in Tokyo at Japan Bond Trading Co., the
nation’s largest interdealer debt broker, after touching 1.095
percent, the lowest since November. The 1.2 percent security due
June 2021 gained 0.045 yen to 100.898.  Ten-year bond futures for September delivery added 0.11 to
141.36 at the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  U.S. 10-year yields dropped seven basis points to 2.91
percent yesterday while the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.3
percent.  EU leaders urged Greece to pass a package of budget cuts
and vowed to do what’s needed to meet the country’s financing
needs, the EU said in a statement in Brussels yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
