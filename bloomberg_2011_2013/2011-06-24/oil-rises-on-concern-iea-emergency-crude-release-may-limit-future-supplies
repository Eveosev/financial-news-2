Oil rose in  New York , reversing
yesterday’s plunge, amid concern producers including Saudi
Arabia may reduce output in response to the  International Energy
Agency ’s move to release oil stockpiles.  Crude advanced as much as 1.5 percent, after falling 4.6
percent yesterday. The International Energy Agency agreed to
release 60 million barrels to buyers starting next week. Oil
stockpiles among the 28 member-countries of the IEA declined by
340,000 barrels a day during the first quarter of this year, the
Agency said in its monthly Oil Market Report on June 16.  “Once the temporary stock release is over, the flow of
Saudi Arabian crude could dry up, tightening up balances by
year-end and into 2012,” Barclays Plc analysts including
London-based  Paul Horsnell  wrote in a report today.  Crude for August delivery added 55 cents, or 0.6 percent,
to $91.57 on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  as of 9:42 a.m.
London time. Brent crude for August was at $106.81 a barrel,
down 0.4 percent, on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
