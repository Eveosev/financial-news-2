STR Holdings Inc. (STRI) , the world’s
largest provider of protective coatings for solar panels,
dropped 10 percent in early New York trading after reducing
second quarter sales guidance.  STR fell $1.97 to $14.75 as of 8:18 a.m. on the New York
Stock Exchange. At the close of trading yesterday, the shares
had dropped 16 percent this year.  Second quarter sales will be in the range of $98 million to
$101 million, down from prior guidance of $104 million to $110
million, Enfield, Connecticut-based STR said in a statement
after the close of regular U.S. trading yesterday.  Robert Brown , an analyst at Craig-Hallum Capital Group in
 Minneapolis , today downgraded STR to “accumulate” from “buy”
and reduced his 12-month price target to $21 from a May 5
forecast of $33 a share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
