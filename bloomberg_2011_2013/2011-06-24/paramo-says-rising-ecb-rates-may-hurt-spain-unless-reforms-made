European Central Bank Executive
Board member Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Paramo said  Spain  could be
hurt by rising interest rates if  labor laws  aren’t overhauled to
steer the economy back to growth.  “The divergence from the European cycle would be punished
with the change in the interest-rate cycle,” Gonzalez-Paramo
said in a speech in Malaga today. “This diagnosis is so obvious
to observers, analysts and international organizations that the
delay in completing the reforms is surprising.”  Gonzalez-Paramo said the Frankfurt-based ECB has started a
“normalization process” for monetary policy, although rates
“remain very accommodative.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
