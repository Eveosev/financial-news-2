(Corrects to AC Milan in final paragraph.)  Inter Milan  said Gian Piero
Gasperini will coach the Italian soccer club next season.  Gasperini, 53, will sign a two-year contract, with final
details still to be worked out, Inter said on its website. He’ll
replace Leonardo, who took over after  Rafael Benitez  was fired
in December.  Gasperini led Genoa to promotion to Serie A in 2007 and
qualified for the Europa League two seasons later. He was fired
by the club in November.  Inter finished second in Serie A last season, six points
behind archrival AC Milan.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
