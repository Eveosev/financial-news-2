Sugar fell for the second time in
three days on speculation that increased exports from  India , the
world’s second-biggest producer, will ease global supply
concerns. Cocoa declined, and coffee rose.  India said it would allow an additional 500,000 metric tons
of sugar exports after already shipping 2.2 million tons since
Oct. 1. Raw-sugar futures in  New York  have dropped 19 percent
this year.  “India has rattled the market,” said Sterling Smith, an
analyst at Country Hedging Inc. in  St. Paul , Minnesota.  Raw sugar for October delivery fell 0.08 cent, or 0.3
percent, to settle at 26 cents a pound at 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in New York, narrowing this week’s gain to 2.4 percent.  Production will exceed demand by 7.8 million tons in the
season that starts Oct. 1, VM Group and ABN Amro Bank NV said
today in their first estimate for the period.  Brazil  is the
leading grower.  Cocoa futures for September delivery fell $23, or 0.8
percent, to $2,964 a ton in New York. The price gained 1.6
percent this week.  Arabica-coffee futures for September delivery gained 1.8
cents, or 0.7 percent, to settle at $2.505 a pound on ICE. The
commodity declined 0.8 percent this week.  In  London , refined sugar and robusta coffee advanced, and
cocoa dropped on NYSE Liffe.  To contact the reporters on this story:
