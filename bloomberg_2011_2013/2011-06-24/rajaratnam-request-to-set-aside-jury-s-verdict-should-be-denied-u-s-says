Raj Rajaratnam’s request to be
acquitted, after he was found guilty at trial in the largest
insider-trading prosecution in a generation, should be denied,
U.S. prosecutors said.  “The evidence against Rajaratnam at trial was
overwhelming,” Justice Department lawyers said in a filing
today in federal court in  Manhattan . “The jury heard
devastating evidence of Rajaratnam orchestrating numerous
insider-trading crimes and instructing others how to cover them
up in his own voice in multiple recorded conversations.”  Rajaratnam, 54, was found guilty May 11 of all 14 counts
against him. The Galleon Group LLC co-founder faces as long as
19 1/2 years in prison. His lawyers last month asked the judge
to set aside the verdict, saying the evidence against him was
non-existent or so meager that no reasonable jury could have
found him guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.  John Dowd , a lawyer for Rajaratnam, didn’t immediately
return a call to his office seeking comment after regular
business hours.  The case is U.S. v. Rajaratnam, 09-01184, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of  New York  (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
