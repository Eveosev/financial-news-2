Light Louisiana Sweet oil weakened
the most in a year as the gap between West Texas Intermediate
and Brent narrowed a second day after the Energy Department
announced a release of emergency oil stockpiles.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart decreased
$1.88 to $14.36 a barrel as of 1:14 p.m. in  New York . When Brent
gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of low-sulfur U.S.
grades that compete with West African oil priced against the
European benchmark.  The department will release 30 million barrels of mostly
light, sweet, crude from storage facilities along the Gulf of
Mexico, half of a planned 60 million-barrel release coordinated
by the  International Energy Agency .  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium slumped $3.80 to $15 a
barrel over West Texas Intermediate as of 12:11 p.m. in New
York, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
largest single-day price drop since May 26, 2010. Heavy
Louisiana Sweet lost $4 to $14.75 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed $3 to $11 a barrel, while Poseidon lost $2 to
$9.50 over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed $2.25 to $9.25 a
barrel over WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount was unchanged at
$1.50. Thunder Horse’s premium lost $3.80 to $15 a barrel.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $8. Syncrude is a
light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the  tar sands  in
 Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$20.75 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
