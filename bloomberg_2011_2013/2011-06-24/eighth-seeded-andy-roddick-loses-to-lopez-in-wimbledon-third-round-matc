Three-time Wimbledon finalist  Andy
Roddick  lost to  Feliciano Lopez  of Spain in their third-round
match at the grass-court tennis tournament.  The 29-year-old Spaniard won 7-6 (7-2), 7-6 (7-2), 6-4. It
was the first time Roddick, 28, had lost to Lopez in eight

finals to Roger Federer.  Lopez, ranked 44th by the menâ€™s ATP tennis tour, made the
quarterfinals twice at the All England Club. He lost to Lleyton
