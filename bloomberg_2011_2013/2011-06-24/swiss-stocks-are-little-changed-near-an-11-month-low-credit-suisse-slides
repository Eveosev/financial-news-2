Swiss stocks pared gains, with the
Swiss Market Index trading near an 11-month low, as European
Union leaders pledged to aid  Greece .  Credit Suisse Group AG dropped 1.8 percent and Swiss Re
tumbled 2.4 percent.  The SMI gained 5.96, or 0.1 percent, to 5,997.05 at 4:55
p.m. in Zurich. The broader Swiss Performance Index retreated
0.1 percent.  EU officials vowed at a summit in Brussels yesterday to
stave off a default in Greece as long as the countryâ€™s Prime
Minister  George Papandreou   pushes through a package of budget
cuts and tax increases next week. Greek lawmakers are due to
vote on 78 billion euros ($111 billion) of austerity measures on
June 30.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
