Frontline Ltd., operator of the
world’s largest supertanker fleet, fell more than it should have
yesterday after the  International Energy Agency  said its members
would release emergency oil stocks, Pareto Securities AS said.  Frontline declined 7.7 kroner, or 8.3 percent, to 85 kroner
a share in Oslo yesterday, giving the company a market value of
6.6 billion kroner ($1.2 billion). It fell a further 0.7 percent
today. The IEA said yesterday its members will release 60
million barrels of oil reserves over the next month to
compensate for lost shipments from  Libya , curbing the need for
seaborne cargoes.  “We find yesterday’s 8.3 percent slide in the Frontline
share price to be an overreaction,” Pareto analyst Wilhelm Gedde-Dahl in Oslo said by e-mail today.  The 2 million barrels a day of released stocks won’t
translate into a comparable loss in demand for tankers because
some of the oil will be refined fuels such as gasoline, Pareto
said. Frontline ships crude oil. Part of any lost demand for
imports would also fall on overland shipments, Gedde-Dahl said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
