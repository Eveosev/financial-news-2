Spanish producer-price inflation
slowed in May as energy costs declined.  Prices of goods leaving  Spain ’s factories, mines and
refineries rose 6.7 percent from a year earlier after gaining an
annual 7.3 percent in April, the  National Statistics Institute 
in Madrid said today. From the previous month, prices dropped
0.3 percent after increasing 0.6 percent in April.  Crude-oil prices have dropped 20 percent from a peak on
April 29. They are still 20 percent higher than a year ago,
stoking inflation across  Europe . The  European Central Bank 
raised borrowing costs for the first time in almost three years
in April and policy makers have indicated more increases may
follow as the euro-area inflation rate holds above the bank’s 2
percent limit.  Consumer-price inflation in Spain, at 3.4 percent in May,
is higher than the euro-region average of 2.7 percent, even as
the economy struggles to emerge from an almost two-year
recession.  To contact the reporter on this story:
