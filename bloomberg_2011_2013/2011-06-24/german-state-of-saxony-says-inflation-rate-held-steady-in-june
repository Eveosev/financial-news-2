Inflation in the German state of
Saxony was steady in June as crude  oil prices  retreated.  The inflation rate held at 2.3 percent from May, the
state’s statistics office in Kamenz said today. In the month,
prices advanced 0.1 percent. The Federal Statistics Office in
Wiesbaden is scheduled to release German inflation, based on
data from six states, on June 28. Economists expect the German
harmonized rate to rise to 2.5 percent from 2.4 percent, the
median of 10 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey shows.  In the 17-member euro region, inflation slowed to 2.7
percent in May from 2.8 percent in the previous month. The
 European Central Bank , which aims to keep the annual rate of
consumer-price gains just below 2 percent, has signaled it’s
ready to raise borrowing costs again next month to fight price
pressures.  Crude oil prices have dropped 7.7 percent over the past
month. They’re up 20 percent from a year earlier, adding
pressure on companies to raise prices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
