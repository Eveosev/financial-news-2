The Hungarian government will
increase the capital of state-owned carrier Malev Zrt. by 4.5
billion forint ($12.7 million),  Magyar Hirlap  reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Without the capital increase, the airline may be forced to
stop operating within weeks, according to the newspaper.  The state already injected 2.5 billion forint into Malev
this year, Hirlap said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
