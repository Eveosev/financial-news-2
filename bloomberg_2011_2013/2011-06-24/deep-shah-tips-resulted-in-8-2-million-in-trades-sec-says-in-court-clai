the insider trading case of Galleon Group LLC co-founder  Raj Rajaratnam , resulted in $8.2 million in profits, the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission said in court papers.  The SEC yesterday filed papers seeking a default judgment
against Shah, claiming he hasn’t responded to its suit filed in
2009. The complaint was served on Shah in  Mumbai , according to
the SEC.  The agency claims Shah passed along inside information
about acquisitions involving Hilton Hotels Corp. and Kronos Inc.
