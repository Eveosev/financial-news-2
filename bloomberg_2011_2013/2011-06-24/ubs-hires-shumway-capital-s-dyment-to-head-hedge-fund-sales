UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest bank,
hired John Dyment as global head of hedge fund distribution to
boost its investment bank’s business with these clients.  Dyment will be based in  New York  and have the
responsibility for all hedge fund sales across the investment
bank’s equity and fixed-income divisions, Zurich-based UBS said
in an e-mailed statement today. He joins from Shumway Capital
Partners, which at its peak was a $9 billion hedge fund based in
Greenwich,  Connecticut , UBS said.  Dyment worked for six years until August 2007 at Deutsche
Bank AG, where he managed the global hedge fund capital group
and helped oversee an annual survey of hedge-fund investors.
Before that, he worked for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. UBS is
trying to strengthen its securities unit, where revenue has
lagged behind rivals for the past two years, and stem defections
in the U.S.  “The hedge fund business presents a significant
opportunity for our global investment banking franchise,”
Yassine Bouhara, co-head of equities at UBS and a former
Deutsche Bank executive, said in the statement. “We are equally
pleased to demonstrate continued investment in our senior team
in the Americas, which is of critical importance to our global
business.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
