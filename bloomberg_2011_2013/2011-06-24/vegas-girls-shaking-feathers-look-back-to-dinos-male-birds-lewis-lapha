One of the longest-running Las Vegas
revues features topless women dancing around in the plumage of
wild birds. One headdress can contain more than 2,000 feathers,
with additional plumes in backpack and “butt piece.”  (To listen to the podcast, click  here .)  Many of the 1,000 handmade costumes used in “Jubilee!”
date from the show’s premiere in 1981, carefully repaired as
necessary with ostrich, rhea, pheasant, wild turkey, chicken and
goose feathers.  It’s tough to wear the showgirl gear. “Not enough swish,
and no one looks at you,” explained one dancer. “Too much
swish, and your costume falls off.”  The elaborate revue closely resembles the mating rituals of
male birds, as they strut their stuff to outdo competitors and
attract fertile females.  I spoke with Thor Hanson, author of “ Feathers: The
Evolution of a Natural Miracle ,” on the following topics:  1. Dinosaur Evolution  2. Diversity of Form & Function  3. Religious Icons  4. Fashion Trade  5. Sexual Allure of Plumage  To buy this book in  North America , click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
