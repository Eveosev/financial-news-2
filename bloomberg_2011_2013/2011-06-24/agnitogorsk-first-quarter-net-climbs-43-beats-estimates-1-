OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel,
Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikovâ€™s steelmaker, said first-
quarter profit rose 43 percent as prices and production
increased.  Net income climbed to $134 million from $94 million a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. That beat the
average estimate of $128 million of 8 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  Sales advanced 34 percent to $2.2 billion, while earnings
before tax, interest, depreciation and amortization increased 8
percent to $403 million, the company said.  The steelmaker expects Russian demand to grow by 10 percent
in 2011, mostly driven by pipemakers and machinery builders.
Magnitogorsk plans to increase 2011 output by between 10 percent
and 15 percent, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
