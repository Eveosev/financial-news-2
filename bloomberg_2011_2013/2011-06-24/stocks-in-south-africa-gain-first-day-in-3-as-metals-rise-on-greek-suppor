South African shares rose for the
first day in three, led by mining company  BHP Billiton Plc (BIL)  as
copper and lead rose after European leaders showed support for
 Greece , easing concern a default may hurt global growth.  The FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index climbed 1.2 percent to
30,680.23 at the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg, bringing the
week’s advance to less than 0.1 percent and snapping three weeks
of losses.  Copper gained the first day in three, adding as much as 2.1
percent. Lead rose on the London Metal Exchange. European Union
leaders pledged to stabilize the euro-area economy and stave off
a Greek default as long as Prime Minister  George Papandreou 
pushes through a package of budget cuts next week. Greece’s next
hurdle is to shepherd 78 billion euros ($111 billion) of
austerity measures through parliament.  “The big reversal this morning will be welcome and we can
expect a solid bounce today,” analysts at Johannesburg-based
Renaissance BJM wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.
“Commodity prices have recovered somewhat from yesterday’s
collapse and are all trading higher from our closing levels.”  BHP Billiton  jumped 2.7 percent to 253 rand, taking the
week’s gain to 1.3 percent while  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  climbed 1.9
percent to 315.40 rand, paring yesterday’s 3 percent drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
