Ukraineâ€™s farmers harvested 13
percent of the area planted with winter barley in the East
European nation, the  Agriculture Ministry  said.  The farmers gathered 448,200 tons from 153,000 hectares
(378,000 acres) in the south of the country, the ministry said
today in e-mailed statement.  Yields have increased to 2.9 tons a hectare compared with
2.6 tons a year earlier. The condition of spring barley is
satisfactory in most areas, and unsatisfactory in some fields in
southern and eastern regions, the ministry said.  Rapeseed harvesting started in the southern Mykolayiv
region, the ministry said. Rapeseed yields have been 1.05 tons
a hectare compared with 1.04 tons last year, the ministry said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
