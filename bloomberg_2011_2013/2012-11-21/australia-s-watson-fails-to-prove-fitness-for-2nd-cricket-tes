Australia  vice-captain Shane Watson
won’t play in the second cricket Test against South Africa
starting tomorrow in Adelaide because he hasn’t fully recovered
from a calf injury.  Captain Michael Clarke said lingering doubts about Watson’s
fitness prompted Australia to name an unchanged team from that
which drew the series opener in Brisbane. Swing bowler Ben Hilfenhaus kept his place in the attack ahead of Mitchell Starc,
who was named as the 12th man.  “He’s improved a lot over the last few days, but we feel
like he’s probably a few days short of being 100 percent,”
Clarke said of Watson at a televised news conference. “We’re
doing everything in our power to give him every opportunity to
be right for the third Test in Perth.”  South Africa, which would retain the No. 1 spot in the
International Cricket Council’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat
in the best-of-three contest, made two changes by calling up
spinner Imran Tahir and batsman Francois du Plessis.  Tahir replaces fast bowler Rory Kleinveldt and du Plessis
comes in for JP Duminy, who ruptured his left Achilles tendon
during a training drill in Brisbane.  Australia can overtake the Proteas atop the rankings with a
series victory.  AUSTRALIA: Michael Clarke (captain), David Warner,  Ed
