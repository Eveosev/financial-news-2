Germany ’s winter grain planting is
nearing completion, and the rapeseed area is likely to expand
from the past season because of drier conditions, Alfred C.
Toepfer International GmbH said.  The country’s corn harvest also is almost finished, the
Hamburg-based trader said today in an e-mailed report. While
some regions in eastern Germany are too dry, soil moisture
conditions are sufficient in most of the country, it said.  Toepfer estimated Germany’s 2012 wheat production at 22.65
million metric tons, its corn crop at 5.24 million tons, and
rapeseed output at 5.03 million tons, little changed from last
month’s projections. The country is the European Union’s second-
largest wheat and rapeseed grower and the third-largest producer
of corn, according to Toepfer.  Wheat production in the 27-country EU may total 123.97
million tons in 2012, down from 129.64 million tons a year
earlier, Toepfer said. Corn output may drop to 53.2 million
tons, from 65.35 million tons in 2011. Rapeseed output was
pegged at 19.42 million tons, compared with 19.05 tons million
in the previous season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
