European banks’ reluctance to make
unsecured loans to one another rose to the highest in two weeks,
according to a money-market indicator.  The difference between the euro interbank offered rate and
overnight indexed swaps, known as the Euribor-OIS spread, was
12.5 basis points at 8:30 a.m. in  London  from 11.5 yesterday,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. The measure is the highest
since Nov. 7.  The cost for European banks to borrow in dollars was little
changed with the three-month cross-currency basis swap at 28
basis points below Euribor, or 0.28 percentage point. The one-
year basis swap was 29.5 basis points below Euribor from minus
29 yesterday.  The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight index
average, or Eonia, of unsecured lending deals was set at 0.074
percent yesterday from 0.077 percent the day before. The Eonia
swap, an estimate of average overnight borrowing costs over the
next three months, was 6.5 basis points from 6.8 yesterday.  Lenders cut  overnight deposits  at the European Central Bank
yesterday to 230 billion euros ($293 billion) from 240 billion
euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
