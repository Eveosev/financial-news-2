Spanish 10-year bonds advanced,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost two weeks, after
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said she saw a chance for a deal
on aid for  Greece  as soon as next week.  Spain’s benchmark  securities  gained for a second day as
optimism the Greek crisis will be resolved boosted demand for
the debt of so-called peripheral nations. Greece’s 10-year
securities rose for a ninth day as German Finance Minister
Wolfgang Schaeuble said the Eurogroup united on the idea of a
Greek bond buyback, although some “technical questions”
remained open. Germany’s 10-year bunds were little changed.  “The market is slightly risk-on, possibly after Merkel’s
comments,” said Lyn Graham-Taylor, a fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “Spain is being dragged with
the risk-on feeling, while Greece is benefiting from talk of a
buyback.”  Spanish 10-year yields declined seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 5.71 percent at 4:32 p.m. London time after
touching 5.70, the  least  since Nov. 8. The 5.85 percent bond
maturing in January 2022 rose 0.52, or 5.20 euros per 1,000-euro
($1,281) face amount, to 100.93.  European Union finance ministers meeting in Brussels
yesterday left the next tranche of Greek aid frozen until
another meeting on Nov. 26. They failed to tackle the dual task
of steering an extra 32.6 billion euros to the Mediterranean
nation through 2016 while finding a way to tame the resulting
increase in its debt, already the highest in  Europe .  Merkel Comments  The will to keep Greece in Europe shouldn’t detract from
the need to carry out necessary reforms, Merkel told the German
parliament in Berlin.  Schaeuble said possible solutions include reducing interest
payments on its initial bailout loans, suspending payouts
through 2020 on Greece’s second rescue package, or having the
European Central Bank buy 9 billion euros of the country’s
Treasury bills, according to four people who attended the
briefing in Brussels.  There is a more than 50 percent chance that voluntary
buybacks will be agreed next week at a 5-10 euro-cent premium on
the current market price, London-based Nomura International Plc
economists Dimitris Drakopoulos and Lefteris Farmakis wrote in a
client note today.  “The consensus continues to be that will have some kind of
an agreement on Greece,” said Michael Markovich, head of global
interest-rates research at Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich.
“We’ve had delays before so I would not overemphasize that. If
you look at the market it doesn’t seem to have had a material
impact.”  Longest Streak  Greek government bonds maturing in February 2023 extended
their streak of gains to the longest since the nation’s debt was
restructured in March. The yield dropped 35 basis points to
16.75 percent, leaving the price at 33.69 percent of face value.  Germany  sold 4 billion euros of 10-year bunds at an  average
yield  of 1.40 percent, down from 1.56 percent at the previous
sale of the securities on Oct. 24. That’s the lowest rate since
an auction of 10-year bonds on July 11, which were sold at a
record-low yield of 1.31 percent.  The nation’s 10-year yields rose two basis points to 1.44
percent.  Volatility on Portuguese bonds was the highest in euro-
region markets today, followed by those of Ireland, according to
measures of 10-year or equivalent-maturity debt, the spread
between two- and 10-year securities, and credit default swaps.  Ireland, Portugal  The yield on Irish bonds due in October 2020 fell 17 basis
points to 4.49 percent. It touched 4.47 percent, the lowest
since the securities were first auctioned in January 2010, based
on closing prices.  Ireland and  Portugal  may re-start issuing bonds in 2013 to
cover at least their redemption profile, London-based UBS AG
strategists Gianluca Ziglio and Pooja Kumra wrote in a client
note dated yesterday.  Portugal’s borrowing costs rose as the government sold a
combined 2 billion euros of three-, six- and 18-month bills in
its last debt auction for this year. The nation sold 1.2 billion
euros of securities due in May 2014 at an average yield of 2.99
percent, compared with 2.967 percent at a previous auction of
18-month bills on Sept. 19, the debt management agency said.  Investors bought 500 million euros of six-month bills at
2.169 percent, up from 1.839 percent on Oct. 17, and 300 million
euros of three-month securities at 1.936 percent, versus
1.366 percent on Oct. 17.  Portugal last sold bonds at auction in April 2011, while
Ireland last issued in September 2010, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  German bonds returned 3.6 percent this year through
yesterday, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the
European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Italian
securities gained 18 percent, and Spain’s earned 2.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
