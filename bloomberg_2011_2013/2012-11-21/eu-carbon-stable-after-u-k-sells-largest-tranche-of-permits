European Union carbon permits were
little changed after demand for allowances in the latest auction
grew compared with the previous sale.  Permits for December erased early losses to advance as much
as 2.8 percent to 6.93 euros ($8.88) a metric ton on  London â€™s
ICE Futures Europe exchange. They closed 3 cents, or 0.5
percent, higher at 6.77 euros.  The U.K. sold 6.5 million permits at 6.62 euros a ton in
its first auction of allowances for 2013. Bidders sought 18.5
million permits in the auction, 2.8 times the volume for sale.
Buyers yesterday bid for 2.7 times as many permits as were
offered by the EU, and between 1.2 and 1.7 times as many as were
offered in three sales from Nov. 13 through Nov. 16.  The EU, Greece,  Germany  and the U.K. are selling a total of
21 million tons of permits this week as the bloc ramps up its
auctioning program before the start of the third phase of the
market, which runs from 2013 through 2020.  United Nations Certified Emission Reductions for December
rose as much as 13 percent to 88 cents a ton, matching the
highest for more than a week. They were up 5.1 percent at 82
cents at 4:55 p.m. in London.  To contact the reporter on this story:
