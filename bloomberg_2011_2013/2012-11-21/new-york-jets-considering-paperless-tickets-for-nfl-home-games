The  New York  Jets are considering
using paperless tickets for games at MetLife Stadium, according
to Neil Glat, president of the National Football League team.  Glat said smart phones will be an important part of
attending games in the future, allowing fans to do everything
from shopping to watching replays.  “We are looking at some paperless ticket solutions,” he
said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s “Bloomberg
West.” “That would include how you get in the stadium, but it
could be cashless transactions, it could be how you buy
merchandise, it could be how you buy food.”  The team already has a smart phone application allowing
fans to watch replays and action from other games while at the
stadium, Glat said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
