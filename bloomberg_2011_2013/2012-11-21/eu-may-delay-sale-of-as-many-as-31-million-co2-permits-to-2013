The European Union may delay the
sale of as many as 31 million carbon permits for 2013 to next
year if eight nations fail to complete paperwork before Dec. 4,
according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  Only 12 of 25 member states have joined auctions hosted by
the European Energy Exchange AG early enough to sell their full
shares of 120 million so-called early Phase 3 allowances before
the end of the year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg New
Energy Finance. Phase 3 runs from 2013 through 2020.  The European Union will sell allowances representing more
than half of the total cap on discharges in the bloc in the
third phase of its carbon market. Countries must spread early
auction volumes evenly. Late starters will have to sell their
quota in sales that may run through April, according to James Cooper, an analyst in  London  at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.  The first 12 countries will sell their entire portion of
allowances totaling 48.3 million metric tons of permits by the
final auction scheduled for Dec. 18, Cooper said.  They will be joined by four more countries from Nov. 27,
and by  Greece  from Dec. 4, according to a calendar of auctions
on the EEX  website . These nations will only sell a portion of
their total quota in the remaining sales, according to Cooper.  “If the eight remaining countries begin auctioning from
Dec. 11, 21.3 million tons will fall into 2013,” Cooper said in
an e-mailed response to questions. “If the remaining countries
are not included in the Dec. 3 calendar release, 31 million tons
will spill into 2013.”  The EU’s original intention was to sell the early volumes
before the end of 2012, before it began carrying out regular
sales of allowances in 2013. The U.K. will auction its full
allocation of 12.3 million tons in two lots on the ICE Futures
 Europe  exchange, the first of which took place today.  Germany  is
selling its full quota of 23.5 million tons in eight tranches on
the EEX bourse.  EU permits for December 2013 rose 0.7 percent to 7.07 euros
($9.06) a ton at 4:31 p.m. London time on ICE Futures Europe.  To contact the reporter on this story:
