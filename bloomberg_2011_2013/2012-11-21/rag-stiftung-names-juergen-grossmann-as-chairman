(Corrects to clarify that executive named in fourth
paragraph is Linssen’s predecessor.)  RAG-Stiftung, which owns  Germany ’s
largest non-listed chemical maker Evonik Industries AG, named
Helmut Linssen as its finance chief.  Linssen, 70, will take up the role on Dec. 1, and Barbel
Bergerhoff-Wodopia, 57, joins him on the board with
responsibility for human resources, the Essen-based trust said
in an e-mailed statement today. Werner Mueller, a former economy
minister and past chief executive officer of Evonik, was named
chairman of the executive board earlier this month.  The new board will help decide on the future of Evonik
after it abandoned a third attempt at an initial public offering
in June. The proceeds from the IPO had been earmarked to help
close the last of Germany’s subsidized deep-shaft coal mines by
2018.  The new board members will replace Peter-Michael Preusker
and Guenter Schlatter. Mueller will replace Wilhelm Bonse- Geuking.  Evonik, which refocused on chemicals after selling the
majority stake in its energy business, is exploring options to
divest its real-estate assets, which are held jointly with union
IG BCE and valued at 6.2 billion euros ($7.9 billion), according
to a company document.  CVC Capital Partners owns a 25 percent stake in Evonik.  To contact the reporter on this story:
