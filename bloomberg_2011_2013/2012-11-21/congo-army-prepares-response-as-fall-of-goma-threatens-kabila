The  Democratic Republic  of Congo’s
army said it’s preparing a response to the capture of Goma by
rebel forces as a research group warned the fall of the city
threatens the survival of President  Joseph Kabila ’s government.  M23 rebels today pushed south from Goma, the capital and
economic center of the resource-rich North Kivu province, taking
the town of Sake and continuing toward  South Kivu  province,
United Nations-backed broadcaster  Radio Okapi  said. The fighters
now control the entire border between North Kivu and Rwanda,
making it easier to receive assistance from their backers, Ben
Payton,  Africa  analyst at Bath, U.K.-based risk analysis group
Maplecroft, said in an e-mailed report.  Kabila faces “a fight to hold onto power, with his critics
in Kinshasa likely to demand a change of leadership in order to
rescue the situation and prevent even greater territorial
losses,” Payton said.  Congo is Africa’s largest producer of tin ore, the biggest
copper producer after Zambia, and the source of about half the
world’s cobalt. It is also an important source of columbite-
tantalite, the mineral known as coltan that is used in mobile
phones and computers. A UN group of experts monitoring Congo’s
arms embargo has accused Rwanda and  Uganda  of backing the
rebels, allegations both governments deny.  Copper, Cobalt  Freeport McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  of the U.S., Baar,
Switzerland-based  Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , and Minmetals
Resources Ltd., based in  Hong Kong , have copper and cobalt
projects in the country.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS) ,  Banro Corp. (BAA) 
and  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  are investing in gold mines in the
country, which is about the size of Western Europe.  “The realization that the Congolese military is incapable
of guaranteeing security means that the businesses in the
country now face an even more uncertain operating environment,”
Payton said.  Banro, which operates the Twangiza mine in South Kivu about
200 kilometers (162 miles) south of Goma, said its operations
have been unaffected by developments in eastern Congo. The stock
fell 3.6 percent today after sinking 13 percent yesterday.  Police broke up demonstrations against the government today
in Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, Radio Okapi said. Security
forces deployed to block protesters in several other provincial
capitals and cities, including in Kisangani, where three people
died and numerous buildings burned in protests yesterday, the
Kinshasa-based broadcaster said.  War Crimes  M23 captured Goma yesterday after resuming fighting against
Congo’s army five days ago, ending an unofficial three-month
cease-fire. The renegade group is made up of soldiers that
mutinied in April and is headed by General Bosco Ntaganda, who
is wanted by the  International Criminal Court  for  war crimes .  The UN peacekeeping force in Congo defended its attempt to
stop the city from falling into rebel hands after the national
army retreated. UN soldiers are in Congo to support the army,
not replace them, Lieutenant-Colonel Prosper Basse, military
spokesman for the peacekeeping mission, told reporters today in
Kinshasa.  “The initiative of all operations is the sovereign
responsibility of the Armed Forces of the Democratic Republic of
Congo,” he said. “We will continue to support the FARDC when
they express the intention, when they take the initiative for
any action, because in the case of our mandate it is possible,
clearly stated, that we have to support their efforts to
eradicate armed groups.”  650,000 Displaced  Goma was calm this morning, according to the UN Refugee
Agency, which said more than 650,000 people have fled their
homes in eastern Congo since the M23 rebellion began in April.  The army is preparing a response to the fall of the city,
army spokesman Colonel Olivier Hamuli said by phone today,
without giving details. “The government reassures that we’ve
certainly lost the battle but not the war,” Prime Minister
Matata Ponyo said in comments broadcast by Radio Okapi.  Goma, about 1,659 kilometers east of the capital, Kinshasa,
is situated on the border with  Rwanda  at the northern edge of
Lake Kivu. Historically, it has been the main transit point for
minerals from the region.  Congo and Rwanda have fought directly or by proxy since the
late 1990s. A 2009 peace deal between Congo and Rwandan-backed
rebels improved relations between the two countries until the
M23 insurgency began seven months ago.  ‘Immediate Withdrawal’  The UN  Security Council  demanded the immediate withdrawal
of Congo’s M23 rebels from the eastern city of Goma and called
for sanctions against the group’s leaders and backers.  In a  resolution  adopted yesterday, the council also sought
“clarification of reports of external support provided to the
group.” The U.S. State Department said it was “gravely
alarmed” by the rapid deterioration in the security situation
in eastern Congo.  Kabila held talks with his Rwandan counterpart  Paul Kagame 
in Kampala, the Ugandan capital, today to discuss the crisis,
James Mugume, permanent secretary in Uganda’s Foreign Ministry,
said in a phone interview.  The three leaders should “engage in a direct and honest
dialogue in pursuit of a political resolution to the immediate
hostilities,” the State Department said in an e-mailed
statement.  On Nov. 13, the UN imposed sanctions on M23 commander
Colonel Sultani Makenga for violations of international law,
including rape and the use of child soldiers.  ‘External Support’  The Security Council said it’s considering further
sanctions “against the leadership of the M23 and those
providing external support to the M23 and those acting in
violation of the sanctions regime and the arms embargo.”  Two M23 commanders, Innocent Kaina and Baudouin Ngaruye,
may be designated for targeted sanctions, it said.  Congo’s $14.7 billion economy is forecast to grow 7.2
percent this year and 8.2 percent in 2013, according to the
 International Monetary Fund , which has a $529 million loan
agreement with the country.  While the economy has been growing since the end of nearly
a decade of war in 2003, the UN still ranks the country near the
bottom of its Human Development Index, which measures indicators
including education and income.  To contact the reporter on this story:
