Latvia is considering selling yen-
denominated debt next year to broaden the Baltic country’s
funding base to Asian investors, Finance Minister Andris Vilks
said.  “Most likely it would be worth it to consider selling
Samurai bonds next year,” said Vilks to reporters in Riga
today. “Obviously, its worth it to work with these investors so
that they will become regular buyers of Latvian bonds.”  Vilks had meetings with investors in  Hong Kong , Singapore
and  Japan  earlier this year, he said. The Baltic country has
delayed a separate unrelated bond sale this year since interest
rates have not fallen enough to reflect credit rating upgrades
and the passing of the 2013 budget, according to Vilks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
