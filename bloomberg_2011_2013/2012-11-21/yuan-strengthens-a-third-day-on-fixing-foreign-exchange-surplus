China ’s yuan strengthened for a
third day after the central bank raised the reference rate and
as a report signaled a pickup in foreign-exchange inflows.  The People’s Bank of China raised the  fixing  by 0.03
percent to 6.2908 per dollar, the strongest level in a week.
Chinese banks bought $125 billion of foreign currency from their
clients and sold $117.2 billion last month, leaving a surplus of
$7.8 billion, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said
today. Recent appreciation in the yuan was driven by a positive
economic outlook, while expectations on currency gains “are
basically stable,” SAFE said.  “The data follows the rebound of export growth in October,
while some capital is still flowing in,” said Tommy Ong, a Hong
Kong-based senior vice president of treasury and markets at DBS
Bank (Hong Kong) Ltd. “We expect the central bank to set the
fixing closer to the spot, with the latter ending the year at
around 6.2 per dollar.”  The  yuan  climbed 0.05 percent to 6.2297 per dollar as of
10:12 a.m. in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange
Trade System. One-month implied volatility for the yuan, a
measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options, declined
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.67 percent.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the currency gained 0.04
percent to 6.2310 against the greenback, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards
slipped 0.02 percent to 6.3298, a 1.6 percent discount to the
onshore spot rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
