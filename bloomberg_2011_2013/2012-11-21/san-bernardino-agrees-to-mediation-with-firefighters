San Bernardino, the bankrupt
 California  city, and its firefighters union agreed to seek
court-supervised mediation of their labor contract disputes, the
city said in court papers.  The two sides will ask U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Scott Clarkson
to oversee talks aimed at resolving their disagreements, which
were not specified in the court filing today in Riverside,
California.  Two weeks after the city filed for bankruptcy protection on
Aug. 1, the union threatened to try to have the case dismissed.  San Bernardino was the third California city to file
bankruptcy in less than three months. The city of about 209,000
people lies about 60 miles (97 kilometers) east of Los Angeles.
A fiscal emergency, brought on by a $46 million budget
shortfall, forced it to stop paying some creditors and seek
court protection, the city said.  The case is In re San Bernardino, 12-28006, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Central District of California (Riverside).  To contact the reporter on this story:
