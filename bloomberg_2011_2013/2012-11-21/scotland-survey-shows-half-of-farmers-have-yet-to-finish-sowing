Half of Scottish farmers surveyed
have yet to finish planting winter crops for harvest in the
coming season because of wet weather, said  Scotland ’s National
Farmers Union.  A fifth of producers still need to harvest more than 10
percent of their grain or potatoes, NFU Scotland said today in
an online  statement , citing its survey of more than 450 farmers.
One in 10 has gathered no more than 50 percent of crops and half
of farmers needed extra cash to stay in business, it said.  “What the survey has also done is clarify just how
difficult 2012 has been,” NFU Scotland President Nigel Miller
said in the statement. “For those with crops, the relentless
rain endured over many months has hammered crop yields and
quality, driven significant costs into harvesting, left many
crops still standing in the fields and winter seed in the shed
unsown.”  Two-thirds of livestock farmers had to buy feed and bedding
exceeding budgets and 75 percent moved animals into barns
earlier than normal because of the wet conditions, according to
NFU Scotland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
