A federal appeals court in
 California  said it will review its ruling that a law banning
political advertising on public television is unconstitutional.  A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals in San
Francisco ruled 2-1 in April that the government had no evidence
to support its claim that allowing the stations to air public
issue and political ads would harm their educational mission.  A majority of the court’s judges who voted decided to
rehear the case, according to a court order yesterday. The court
didn’t give a reason for the decision.  The case involves a lawsuit brought by Minority Television
Project Inc., a California nonprofit group that operates the
public television  station  KMTP. The station, based in Palo Alto,
California, was fined by the Federal Communications Commission
for violating the ban on public stations’ airing paid
advertisements from corporations.  The station sued the FCC claiming the ban on ads violated
its right to free speech. Public TV and radio stations have been
barred from airing ads for or against political candidates, ads
expressing views on topics of public interest, and ads for
products placed by for-profit companies.  The case is Minority Television Project Inc. v. FCC, 09-
17311, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (San
Francisco).  To contact the reporter on this story:
