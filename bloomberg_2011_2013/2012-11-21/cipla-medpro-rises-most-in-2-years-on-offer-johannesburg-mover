Cipla Medpro South Africa Ltd. (CMP)  rose
the most in more than two years after  Cipla Ltd. (CIPLA) ,  India ’s third-
largest drugmaker by market value, offered to buy a 51 percent
stake in the local pharmaceutical company.  The stock advanced 7.9 percent, the most since August 2010,
to 8.30 rand by the close in Johannesburg. That values the
company at 3.71 billion rand ($413 million).  Cipla Medpro received an indicative proposal from Cipla
India to buy a majority stake for 8.55 rand a share, excluding
the company’s final dividend, which will be capped at 10 cents a
share, the company said in a statement today. Cipla India has
“substantially concluded” a due-diligence study of the
company, it said.  A transaction will “support the company’s expansion into
collaboratively identified African markets,” Cipla Medpro said.  The company’s  30-day historical volatility , a measure of
stock swings, increased to 34 from 26.4 yesterday. The FTSE/JSE
Africa All Share Index’s  30-day volatility measure was  at 8.9
compared with 9.2 yesterday. A higher reading means an asset’s
price can have bigger moves. More than 10 million shares traded,
more than seven times the daily average over the past three
months.  Cipla India has been a core business partner of Cipla
Medpro since the South African company was founded in 1993, it
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
