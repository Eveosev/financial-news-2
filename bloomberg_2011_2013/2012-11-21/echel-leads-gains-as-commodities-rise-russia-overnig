The benchmark index of Russian
stocks traded in New York climbed to a two-week high, led by OAO
 Mechel (MTL) , as prices for commodities and crude oil rebounded.  The  Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index (RUS14BN)  of the most-traded
Russian companies in the U.S. added 0.3 percent to 92.11, rising
for a fifth day in its longest stretch of gains since the start
of September. Futures on Moscow’s RTS Index were little changed
at 141,700, while the Market Vectors  Russia  ETF, the largest
dedicated Russian exchange-traded fund, gained 1 percent to
$27.62, the highest level since Nov. 6.  Declining U.S. oil inventories sparked a 0.7 percent
advance in crude oil, Russia’s biggest export earner. Urals
crude, the nation’s chief export blend, has gained 4 percent in
the past two weeks as the conflict between Israel and Hamas
stoked prospects  Middle East  supplies would be disrupted. The
S&P GSCI Index Spot Index of raw materials rose 0.5 percent to
646.01 yesterday, after sliding 1.2 percent on Nov. 20.  “Russia is a very cyclical play, with oil and steel,”
Arjun Jayaraman, who manages $400 million in emerging-market
equities in  Los Angeles  at Causeway Capital Management LLC said
by phone yesterday. “We’ve seen a near-term pickup in  oil
prices  due to the situation in Israel and Gaza, so that may be
helping oil, and that will help Russia.”  The RTS Volatility Index, which measures expected swings in
futures, slid 0.7 percent to 24.51 points.  Mechel Gains  American depositary receipts of Mechel, Russia’s biggest
maker of steelmaking coal, jumped 2.3 percent to $6.1 in New
York, a one-week high. The ADRs traded at a 0.4 percent discount
to  Mechel (MTLR) ’s Moscow stock, the least since Oct. 16.  The miner extended a 13 billion ruble credit line with VTB
Group to the middle of 2013 from this year after agreeing to pay
nearly twice the  interest rate , the Vedomosti newspaper reported
on Nov. 19, citing a financial statement.  Mechel had $9.15 billion of debt at the end of the last
quarter, with a net debt-to-earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortization ratio of 4.85, making it the
 third-most indebted  company in Russia’s metals and mining
industry.  Moscow-based Mechel is the worst performer in the Russia-US
index in 2012, dropping 28 percent. The ADRs reached their
biggest discount to Moscow in seven weeks on Nov. 16 after MSCI
Inc. said the previous day that the stock would be moved from
its Russia Large Cap Index to the Mid Cap gauge.  Mechel is one of Russia’s most oversold stocks “and could
generate double-digit returns in a week on a healthy index
rebound,”  Chris Weafer , chief strategist at Sberbank CIB, an
arm of Russia’s largest lender, wrote in a Nov. 20 note.  Oil Advances  Deutsche Bank AG equity analyst  George Buzhenitsa  upgraded
the stock to hold from sell yesterday and set a 12-month price
target of $5.60 a share. Mechel rose 0.9 percent to 190.9
rubles, or $6.12, on Russia’s 30-stock Micex Index yesterday.

ADR represents one-tenth of a Micex share.  Nickel climbed for a fourth day on the London Metal
