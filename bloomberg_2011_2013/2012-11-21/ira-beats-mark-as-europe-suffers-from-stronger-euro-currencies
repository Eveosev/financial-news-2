Europe ’s economy, shrinking under
the weight of a three-year debt crisis and rising unemployment,
would be better off if its currency behaved more like the
Italian lira than the deutsche mark.  At least that’s the view of a growing number of investors
and analysts, who say the euro is too strong for Europe’s good.
The shared currency trades 5.5 percent above its lifetime
average of $1.2102, and is 2.6 percent higher than it should be
against the dollar, data on purchasing power compiled by the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show.  The euro has gained more in the past three months than any
of its nine developed-market peers in Bloomberg Correlation-
Weighted Indexes, even with the region’s unemployment rate at a
record 11.6 percent. Instead of acting like the mark, the
bulwark of Europe’s foreign-exchange markets before 1999,
economies and companies would become more competitive if the
euro echoed  Italy ’s lira, which weakened about 30 percent in the
decade before countries did away with individual currencies.  “The euro is not sustainable at these levels in the
medium-to-long run,”  Ulrich Leuchtmann , the Frankfurt-based
head of currency strategy at Commerzbank AG,  Germany ’s second-
biggest bank, said in a phone interview on Nov. 19. “This has
to be an economic area with a soft currency, more like the lira
before 1999 than the deutsche mark. A weaker currency will help
to contain some of the problems.”  Purchasing Power  The 17-nation common currency declined 0.1 percent to
$1.2801 as of 11:09 a.m.  London  time today. It gained 0.7
percent to 105.41 yen. After closing at $1.18 on Jan. 1, 1999,
it has traded as high as $1.6038 in July 2008, and as low as
82.30 U.S. cents in October 2000.  The euro has strengthened 4.2 percent since a pledge by
European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  on July 26 to do
whatever it takes to safeguard the monetary union. It was 2.7
percent undervalued against the dollar the day before he made
that vow, having weakened to a 2012 low of $1.2043 on July 24,
according to data from the Paris-based OECD, which uses relative
costs of goods and services.  The shared currency may fall back to $1.23 by the end of
2013, Leuchtmann said. The median of at least 46 strategists’
predictions compiled by Bloomberg is for the euro to end this
year at $1.28, before slipping to $1.25 by December next year.  “The euro is still a strong currency, relative to where it
came in,”  Richard Clarida , a global strategic adviser at
Pacific Investment Management Co., said in a panel discussion at
the Bloomberg FX12 Summit in  New York  on Nov. 14. “Given the
macro fundamentals in Europe, a euro at $1.20 would not be the
end of anyone’s world, or even a euro at $1.15. It’s not clear
what’s supporting it now.”  Depreciating Lira  Italy’s currency weakened to 1,659.90 against the dollar on
the last trading day of 1998, from 1,169.25 on Dec. 31, 1987,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Germany’s mark was at
1.6767 per dollar on its last day before the euro’s debut, from
1.5708.  Over that period, Italy’s economy expanded at an average
1.64 percent per year. Growth in Germany, which was reunited in
1990, averaged 1.36 percent between 1992 and 1998, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The lira was devalued by 7 percent against the mark in
September 1992 and Italy left the European Exchange-Rate
Mechanism, which had been intended to reduce currency-market
volatility. When it rejoined the ERM in November 1996, the lira
had lost more than 20 percent against the German currency.  Corruption Investigations  The financial market turmoil provided a backdrop for
corruption investigations beginning in 1992, which led to the
collapse of Italy’s dominant political parties. That opened the
door for  Silvio Berlusconi  to enter politics. He was elected as
prime minister in 1994, and his first government lasted less
than a year. Italy elected another four prime ministers by April
2000.  Germany has had three leaders since reunification in 1990,
with  Angela Merkel  as Chancellor since 2005.  Currency debasement to boost exports is no longer an option
to offset spending cuts needed to bring deficits of countries
including Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece to within European
Union limits. That’s creating a dilemma for Draghi, who needs to
balance inflation across all euro-area nations even as he takes
steps to tackle the sovereign debt crisis.  For  Marcus Hettinger , a foreign-exchange strategist at
Credit Suisse Group AG in Zurich, policy makers’ efforts to
reorganize the currency bloc’s economy are already showing
success and the euro will probably climb to $1.35 in the next
year, as investors remove bets on the monetary union collapsing.  Budget Deficits  “If you look at the whole of the  euro zone , then the debt
is lower than the U.S. and the  government deficit  is lower,”
Hettinger said in a Nov. 14 telephone interview. “It’s just
that in the past year or two, some investors have had the
impression that it’s not a single entity anymore.”  The nations that share the euro will probably reduce the
region’s budget deficit in 2013 and 2014, according to Bloomberg
surveys of economists. They will also record current-account
surpluses, the broadest measure of trade in goods and services,
of 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent of gross domestic product,
compared with shortfalls of 3 percent of GDP in both years for
the U.S. The surplus means that Europe isn’t reliant on foreign
capital to fund its investment and spending.  While the euro has weakened about 0.7 percent in the past
month, according to Bloomberg Correlation Weighted Indexes, it
has strengthened 2.4 percent in the past three months. Since its
creation in 1999, the euro has depreciated about 15 percent.  Net Shorts  Hedge funds  and other large speculators are increasing bets
the European currency will weaken. The difference in the number
of wagers on a decline in the euro compared with those on a gain
was 83,646 on Nov. 13, compared with 67,141 a week earlier.
That’s the most since the period through Sept. 14.  Euro-area GDP contracted 0.1 percent in the third quarter
after a 0.2 percent decline in the previous three months, data
showed on Nov. 15. The economy will probably shrink 0.5 percent
this year and grow 0.1 percent next year, according to
economists’ predictions compiled by Bloomberg, while the U.S. is
forecast to expand 2.2 percent this year and 2 percent in 2013.  Italy’s  unemployment rate  rose to a seasonally-adjusted
10.8 percent in September, the highest since the third quarter
of 1999, the Rome-based national statistics office Istat said on
Oct. 31. Spain’s joblessness is a record 26 percent.  Asset Purchases  That contrasts with recovering growth and hiring in the
U.S., where the  Federal Reserve  completed two rounds of stimulus
and said in minutes of last month’s meeting published on Nov. 14
it may increase efforts to sustain an expansion. American
employers added more workers than economists predicted in
October even as the unemployment rate rose to 7.9 percent, Labor
Department figures showed on Nov. 2.  The Fed bought $2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt
from 2008 to 2011. The ECB purchased the equivalent of about
$280 billion of  European debt  through the Securities Markets
Program it announced in May 2010. It sterilized those purchases
by taking the cash back as deposits to avoid stoking inflation
and hasn’t used the program since March.  “It would be very helpful if the ECB could be as loose as
possible and push down the euro,” Michael Siviter, a  money
manager  at Invesco Ltd. in London, which oversees $683 billion,
said in an interview on Nov. 16. “A weaker currency would help
the growth profile.”  Siviter said he forecasts the euro will depreciate against
the dollar, declining to give a forecast.  Export Demand  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EADS) , which hedges to
manage  currency risk  on future Airbus aircraft deliveries, loses
1 billion euros of earnings for every 10-cent increase in the
euro against the dollar. Sanofi, maker of the world’s best-
selling insulin Lantus, said on Oct. 25 that exchange-rate
movements had a positive effect of 6.4 percentage points on
third-quarter sales growth after currencies including the dollar
strengthened against the euro.  Weaker export demand is set to spread to the euro region’s
larger nations, the European Commission said this month.
Shipments from Germany, Europe’s biggest economy, shrank 1.5
percent in September. Italy and Spain reported export declines
of 0.8 percent and 1.2 percent, respectively.  The ECB needs to ease monetary policy, which will cause the
euro to depreciate to $1.15 within a year,  John Hardy , the head
of foreign-exchange strategy at Saxo  Capital Markets  in London,
said in a Nov. 16 phone interview.  “The peripheral economies absolutely must be able to
devalue and at the moment they are not able to do that,” Hardy
said. “They are just in a horrible situation and they need a
weaker currency.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
