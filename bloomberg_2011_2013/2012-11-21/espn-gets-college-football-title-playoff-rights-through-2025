Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s ESPN reached a 12-
year agreement to carry all of the postseason games tied to the
new college football national championship system starting after
the 2014 regular season.  The accord runs through January 2026, ESPN said today in  a
statement . Financial terms of the agreement in principle weren’t
given. The Sports Business Journal reported the deal for the
playoffs and championship is worth more than $7 billion, citing
people in the industry it didn’t name.  “Because of college football’s widespread popularity and
the incredible passion of its fans, few events are more
meaningful than these games,” ESPN President John Skipper said
in the statement. “We are ecstatic at the opportunity to
continue to crown a college football champion on ESPN’s outlets
for years to come, the perfect finale to our year-round
commitment to the sport.”  ESPN is in the middle of a four-year agreement to televise
the Bowl Championship Series, which crowns a national champion.
The network shows the Rose, Sugar, Orange and Fiesta Bowls, as
well as the BCS championship.  The title games on ESPN in 2011 and 2012 generated the two
largest audiences for any program in the history of  cable
television , drawing 27.3 million and 24.2 million viewers
respectively, according to ESPN.  Disney, the world’s largest entertainment company, rose 39
cents to $48.83 at 2:39 p.m. in  New York . Based in Burbank,
 California , Disney had  risen  29 percent this year as of
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
