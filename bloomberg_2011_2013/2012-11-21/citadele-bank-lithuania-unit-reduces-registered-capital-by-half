The Lithuanian unit of Citadele
Banka AS, Latvia’s state-owned retail lender, got central bank
approval to cut its registered capital by almost half.  The Bank of Lithuania’s Supervisory Council decided today
that AB Citadele Bankas could reduce its capital by 137.3
million litai ($50.9 million) to 148.9 million litai and still
meet all risk-related requirements, the central bank said in an
e-mailed statement.  “The bank currently has sufficient capital and seeks to
use it as effectively as possible,” the Lithuanian lender said
in a statement.  The Latvian government plans to sell Citadele, which was
split from Parex Banka after a run on deposits triggered a
government rescue in the Baltic nation’s second-biggest lender
in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
