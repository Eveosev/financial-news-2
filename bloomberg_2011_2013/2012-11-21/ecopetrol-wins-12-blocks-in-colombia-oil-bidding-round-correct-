Colombia awarded new oil and natural
gas blocks today as the fastest-growing major oil producer in
 Latin America  looks to begin offshore exploration and join the
global shale boom.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL) , Colombia’s state-run producer, won 12 blocks
and a venture between Andes Energia Argentina SA and Integra Oil
& Gas picked up seven, Orlando Cabrales, head of the National
Hydrocarbons Agency, told reporters.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ,  Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  and Hocol SA were also among the winners.  Colombia is looking to raise output above 1 million barrels
a day by expanding in areas once dominated by guerrilla groups.
Offshore exploration and drilling for oil and gas found in shale
rock formations probably will start next year, Cabrales said.  Ecopetrol will operate three of the five so-called
unconventional blocks alone and partner with Exxon Mobil in the
other two, he said. Colombia wants to increase unconventional
reserves to 1 billion barrels in the next two decades.  Colombia’s oil production jumped 72 percent since 2007,
allowing the nation to surpass  Argentina  to become the region’s
fourth-largest supplier after Brazil,  Mexico  and  Venezuela .  International investment in crude has climbed after
military strikes weakened the nation’s largest rebel movement,
which is meeting in Oslo with government negotiators for talks
aimed at ending an armed conflict in its fifth decade.  To contact the reporter on this story:
