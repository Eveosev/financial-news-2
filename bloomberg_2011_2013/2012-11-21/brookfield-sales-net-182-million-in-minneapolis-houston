Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO) 
sold towers in Minneapolis and Houston, giving it net proceeds
of $182 million, as investors seeking higher yields lift demand
for buildings outside top-tier U.S. cities.  The $205.5 million sale of 33 S. 6th St. in Minneapolis to
Shorenstein Properties LLC resulted in a net gain of $106
million, and the disposition of a 50 percent stake in Houston’s
KBR Tower to a  W.P. Carey Inc. (WPC)  affiliate brought proceeds of $76
million, New York-based Brookfield said today in a statement.  Buildings in so-called secondary cities made up 31 percent
of office transactions this year through the third quarter,
compared with 23 percent all of last year, according to Real
Capital Analytics Inc. Those markets exclude New York, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Washington, Chicago and Boston.  The 50-story Minneapolis property has 1.1 million square
feet (102,000 square meters) of office space, 370,000 square
feet of retail and 687 parking spaces. Anchor tenant  Target
Corp. (TGT) ’s lease for 72 percent of the office space runs through
2023, Brookfield said. The building is 95 percent leased.  KBR Tower, at 601 Jefferson St. in Houston, has 1.05
million square feet of office and retail space and an adjacent
1,500-space garage. Engineering company  KBR Inc. (KBR)  has its
headquarters at the almost fully leased building, occupying 87
percent on a 20-year lease signed in 2010.  “These dispositions continue our active capital recycling
program over the past two years in which we have sold seven
mature or non-strategic assets,” Brookfield Chief Executive
Officer Dennis Friedrich said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
