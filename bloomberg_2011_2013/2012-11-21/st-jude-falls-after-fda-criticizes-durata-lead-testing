St. Jude Medical Inc. (STJ) , a maker of
heart rhythm devices, sank the most in three years after U.S.
government inspectors criticized the company’s methods for
testing its Durata cables used for defibrillators.  St. Jude fell 12 percent to $31.37 at 4 p.m. New York time,
its largest decline since October 6, 2009. The shares of the  St.
Paul , Minnesota-based company had risen 4.1 percent this year
through yesterday.  St. Jude failed to follow procedures at its  Irvine ,
California, plant for verifying that Durata cables, called
leads, worked properly and safely, the  Food and Drug
Administration  said in an inspection  report  dated Sept. 25
through Oct. 17. Lawrence Biegelsen, an analyst at Wells Fargo
Securities in  New York , downgraded St. Jude to market perform
from outperform.  “Issues raised in the FDA 483 inspection letter are likely
to heighten physicians’ concerns about Durata,” Biegelsen said
in a note to clients.  Each criticism in the eight-page FDA report is followed by
the annotation “Promise to correct.” Biegelsen said he expects
the FDA to issue St. Jude a warning letter in relation to the
inspection report next year.  Durata replaced older Riata wires that St. Jude pulled off
the market in 2010 after research showed that electrical wires
could break through the insulation coating, potentially leading
the device to give off excessive shocks or fail to work when
needed. An August report found Durata’s insulation coating can
fray when it rubs against another object.  To contact the reporter on this story:
