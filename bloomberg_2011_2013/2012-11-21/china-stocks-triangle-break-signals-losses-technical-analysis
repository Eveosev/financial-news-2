The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  will
likely fall to 1,700, a 15 percent drop from yesterday’s close,
after the benchmark index broke through a triangular
consolidation trading pattern, according to Chart Partners.  The  benchmark index ’s slide below “big resistance” at
2,100 and the break of the triangle foreshadow a retreat to
1,700 in the “medium term” and possibly to 1,500,  Thomas Schroeder , Bangkok-based managing director at Chart Partners,
wrote in an e-mailed response to questions.  The Shanghai measure dropped as much as 0.5 percent today
to 1,998.40, the second time it went below 2,000 this week amid
concern the nation’s new leadership may slow efforts to reduce
the government’s grip on the economy. The  index  retreated 0.4
percent to 2,001.76 as of the 11:30 a.m. local-time break.  The bear triangulation “has not only broken back below
2,100 but taken out pattern support,” Schroeder said. “This
will see a new low, uptick and then slide toward 1,700 medium
term with risk to 1,500 where I would turn bullish on a macro
basis.”  Schroeder said in February a rally by the Shanghai
Composite was a “false bounce” that might falter as a so-
called rising wedge pattern mirrored previous failed rebounds.
The index reached its high for the year on March 2 and has since
tumbled 19 percent amid concern a slowing economy will curb
earnings growth.  Weakening Momentum  The Shanghai Composite’s 14-day  relative strength index 
fell to 32 today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
RSI measures how rapidly prices have risen or dropped during the
specified time period. Some traders use a drop below 30 as a
signal to buy.  Shanghai Composite is seeing “weakening price momentum,”
Tacky Cheng, a Hong Kong-based technical analyst at Nomura
Holdings Inc., wrote in a report dated yesterday. “The RSI also
had a negative breakout from an upward channel recently,” said
Cheng, who puts “primary support” for the Shanghai Composite
at the 1,945 level.  Technical analysts look at price charts to forecast
resistance levels, or ceilings restricting further price
increases, and support levels, or floors limiting declines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
