China’s lead climate negotiator said
it would be unfair to require the world’s most-populous nation
to reduce its  carbon emissions  in absolute terms.  China is the world’s largest emitter of carbon emissions
and those emissions continue to grow very quickly,  Xie Zhenhua ,
the nation’s lead climate negotiator and also a vice chairman of
the National Development and Reform Commission, said at a
briefing today. The briefing was held ahead of United Nations
climate talks scheduled for next week in Doha, Qatar.  The world’s second-biggest economy is seeking a turning
point in terms of its emissions, Xie said. It is doing so in its
own way, instead of following developed nations, he said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
