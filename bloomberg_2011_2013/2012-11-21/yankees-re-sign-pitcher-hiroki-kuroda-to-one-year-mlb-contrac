Right-handed pitcher  Hiroki Kuroda ,
who tied for the  New York  Yankees’ lead with 16 wins last
season, signed a new one-year contract with the Major League
Baseball team.  The club did not release details in announcing the deal
yesterday. Kuroda’s contract is worth $15 million salary plus
incentives worth less than $1 million,  ESPN reported , citing
people familiar with the agreement it didn’t identify.  Kuroda, 37, went 16-11 with a 3.32 earned run average in a
team-high 33 starts in 2012, his first season with the Yankees.
 Phil Hughes  also had 16 wins for the team last season.  “I am very happy and excited to re-sign with the
Yankees,” Kuroda said in a team  release . “At the end of the
day, I wanted to try to win a championship with the teammates
that I went to battle with last season.”  Kuroda recorded career bests in wins, starts, innings
pitched (219 2/3) and strikeouts (167) last season. He went 13-5
in his final 24 starts.  A native of Osaka, Japan, Kuroda spent four seasons with
the  Los Angeles Dodgers  before joining the Yankees as a free
agent in January. He has a 57-57 career MLB record.  The Yankees also said yesterday that they had claimed
right-handed relief pitcher Mickey Storey off waivers from the
 Houston Astros . Storey, 26, made his major league debut with the
Astros in August 2012, going 0-1 with a 3.86 ERA in 26
appearances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
