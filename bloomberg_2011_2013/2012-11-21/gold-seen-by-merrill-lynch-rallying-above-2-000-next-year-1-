Gold is poised to rise above $2,000
an ounce next year, while lack of clarity on demand outlook and
policies in China dim prospects for industrial metals, according
to Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, which oversees more than
$1.8 trillion for clients.  “We are holding gold at the moment,”  Bill O’Neill , chief
investment officer for Europe,  Middle East  and Africa, told
reporters in London today. “We just use it as a form of
diversification, a form of catastrophe insurance, but we are
actually looking for a move above $2,000.”  Gold advanced 10 percent to $1,727.78 in London this year,
headed for a 12th consecutive annual gain, the longest streak in
data compiled by Bloomberg going back to 1920. Prices reached a
record $1,921.15 in September 2011.  Global growth will improve slightly next year to 3.2
percent from 3.1 percent, while the  U.S. dollar  is poised to
appreciate, he said.  China’s economy  will expand 8.1 percent in
2013, compared with 7.7 percent in 2012, while the U.S. growth
will slow to 1.5 percent next year from 2.1 percent this year,
he said.  Still, a lack of clarity on demand outlook in  China , the
top metals user, and inventory levels there make it hard to be
positive towards industrial commodities, O’Neill said. A
stronger dollar may also become a headwind next year, he said.  “We don’t really have a commitment to industrial
commodities at the moment,” he said. “This doesn’t necessarily
mean we are not going to commit to anything other than gold in
2013, but for now we don’t see this being part of the
portfolio.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
