Japanese  stocks  rose, with the  Topix (TPX) 
Index closing at its highest level since July, as new U.S. home
construction rose to a four-year high and the yen weakened after
 Japan  posted a trade deficit for a fourth month.  Canon Inc. (7751) , the world’s biggest camera maker, rose 1
percent.  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  jumped 3.2 percent after McKinsey & Co.
said China’s passenger-vehicle sales will expand by an average 8
percent a year.  Japan Steel Works (5631)  Ltd. sank 5.8 percent after
SMBC Nikko Securities Inc. cut its equity rating on the
machinery maker to underperform.  The Topix gained 0.7 percent to close at 767.01 in Tokyo,
with more than twice as many shares advancing as falling. The
 Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  rose 0.9 percent to 9,222.52, with
volume 6.3 percent above the 30-day average.  The trade deficit is “allowing investors to expect the yen
will weaken, which is positive for stock markets,” said Goya
Nakao, a senior investment manager at Sompo Japan Nipponkoa
Asset Management Co., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($61
billion). “U.S. housing has entered a long-term upward trend
because housing inventories and prices have adjusted.”  The Topix has risen 6.2 percent since Nov. 14, when Prime
Minister  Yoshihiko Noda  called for elections that polls show the
opposition party is likely to win. That’s the gauge’s biggest
gain over a five-day period since March 2011.  Japan’s broadest measure of equity prices trades for 0.9
times book value, compared with 2.1 times for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index and 1.5 times for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A
number less than one means that companies can be bought for less
than the value of their assets.  Talks Deadlock  Japanese stocks temporarily pared gains after European
finance ministers failed to agree on a debt-reduction package
for Greece after battling with the  International Monetary Fund 
over how to nurse the country back to fiscal health.  More than 11 hours of talks broke up early today in
Brussels with praise for the Athens government’s economic
overhaul and a declaration that an accord on the financing
package will wait at least until a hastily arranged meeting of
the ministers on Nov. 26.  Exporters got a boost after the yen declined against the
dollar as Japan reported its fourth monthly trade deficit in a
row. The  Finance Ministry  said overseas shipments fell 6.5
percent in October from a year earlier, leaving a deficit of 549
billion yen ($6.7 billion) after imports fell 1.6 percent.
Economists expected a 4.9 percent drop in exports. The yen
depreciated to as low as 81.97 against the dollar.  Canon rose 1 percent to 2,820 yen. Brother Industries Ltd.,
a maker of  office equipment  that gets more than 75 percent of
its sales overseas, gained 1.8 percent to 747 yen.  Car Sales  Carmakers and tire manufacturers gained the most among the
Topix’s 33 industry groups. McKinsey said China’s passenger-
vehicle sales will expand by an average 8 percent a year to
reach 22 million in 2020, driven by demand for sport-utility
vehicles and rising incomes in smaller cities.  Honda Motor jumped 3.2 percent to 2,657 yen. Nissan Motor
Co. advanced 2.1 percent to 766 yen.  Bridgestone, a tiremaker that counts the Americas as its
biggest market, gained 2.8 percent to 1,957 yen. Yokohama Rubber
Co., which supplies tires to Japan’s top carmakers, added 2.1
percent to 547 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.3 percent
today. The  S&P 500  added 0.1 percent yesterday as the increase
in housing starts tempered a tumble in Hewlett-Packard Co.
shares. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said the
central bank doesn’t have the tools to offset the potential harm
to the economy from the so-called fiscal cliff.  Fiscal Cliff  If talks between President  Barack Obama  and the Republicans
and Democrats fail to produce an agreement on the U.S. budget,
it will trigger more than $600 billion in automatic tax
increases and spending cuts that may throw the country into a
recession.  U.S. Housing starts rose 3.6 percent to 894,000, exceeding
all estimates in a Bloomberg survey, Commerce Department figures
showed yesterday in  Washington . The median forecast of 82
economists called for an 840,000 pace.  Among shares that declined, Japan Steel Works declined the
most in the Nikkei 225, falling 5.8 percent to 469 yen after
SMBC Nikko Securities cut the investment rating to underperform
from neutral.  To contact the reporter on this story:
