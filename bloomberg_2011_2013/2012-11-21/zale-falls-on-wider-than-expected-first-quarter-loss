Zale Corp. (ZLC) , the operator of the
Zales and Piercing Pagoda jewelry chains, fell the most in
almost four years after reporting a fiscal first-quarter loss
that was wider than analysts estimated.  The  shares  slid 30 percent to $5.21 at the close in  New
York  for the biggest one-day decline since Nov. 25, 2008. The
shares had gained 95 percent this year through yesterday.  Zale said in a statement yesterday that its loss in the
three months ended Oct. 31 narrowed to $28.3 million, or 88
cents a share, from $31.9 million, or 99 cents, a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated a 68-cent loss.
Sales rose 1.8 percent to $357.5 million, trailing analystsâ€™
average estimate of $366 million.  Zale, based in Irving,  Texas , has posted five straight
years of losses. The company yesterday reiterated that it
expects to be profitable in its current fiscal year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
