The  National Hockey League  and the
NHL Players Association will resume talks on a new collective
bargaining agreement today at league offices in  New York .  The two sides held a 90-minute meeting two days ago, the
first such negotiations since Nov. 11. League officials asked
the union to make a proposal detailing its position on economic
issues.  NHL Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly yesterday told NHL.com
that talks will resume this morning, adding that “I don’t know
about the substance and I have no expectations.”  NHL players have been locked out since Sept. 16, the day
after the old labor contract expired, and the league has
canceled all regular-season games through Nov. 30. The two sides
have been unable to agree on proposed changes to player contract
rights and the sharing of hockey-related revenue.  The NHL has canceled a total of 327 regular-season games
since the start of the lockout. Among them is the annual Winter
Classic scheduled for Jan. 1. Daly said the league would have to
make a decision on canceling more games if an agreement on a new
labor contract isn’t reached soon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
