Peruvian oil and gas liquids output
rose to a 24-year high last month as Dallas-based Hunt Oil Co.
and  Argentina ’s Pluspetrol SA boosted production at the  Camisea 
gas fields to a record, the government said.  Oil and gas liquids production rose 11.3 percent from a
year earlier to 167,785 barrels a day in October, state oil-
licensing agency Perupetro said today in a statement posted on
its website. Natural gas output fell 1 percent to 1.19 billion
cubic feet, Perupetro said.  The seven-company Camisea Group, which boosted gas liquids
by 24 percent to 98,702 barrels per day last month, completed
the expansion of its Malvinas gas separation plant, Hunt’s
country manager Barbara Bruce said. Peru has lined up $23
billion in energy investments during the next decade in a bid to
double oil and gas production, according to Perupetro.  “The number of wells and dimension of the Camisea
structures are so large that it’ll be possible to maintain this
rate of production,” Bruce told reporters today in  Lima . “What
the domestic market can’t consume will be exported.”  Crude oil for January delivery gained 79 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $87.54 a barrel at 3 p.m. on the  New York  Mercantile
Exchange. Natural gas for December delivery rose 6.8 cents, or
1.8 percent, to $3.90 per million British thermal units at 2:59
