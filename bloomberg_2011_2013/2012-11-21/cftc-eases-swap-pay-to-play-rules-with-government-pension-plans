Wall Street banks have been freed
from Dodd-Frank Act limits on political contributions intended
to limit fraud in swaps with government pensions.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the main U.S.
derivatives regulator, said in  a letter yesterday  that it would
not enforce so-called pay-to-play restrictions on banks selling
swaps to the pensions. The restrictions apply to dealers that
have made political contributions to municipal officials in the
two years before a trade.  The CFTC said its decision was intended to harmonize limits
on political contributions from the Securities and Exchange
Commission and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. The CFTC
said in the letter that it acted after industry participants
said they would need to “expend significant resources to update
their current policies and procedures to ensure compliance.”  The Dodd-Frank business conduct standards were completed in
January and were intended to protect less-sophisticated
customers in swap trades with banks. Lawmakers in the Dodd-Frank
Act called for regulators to crack down on abuses in the sales
of derivatives to states, cities and school districts after
municipalities lost billions of dollars on  interest-rate swaps 
during the 2008 credit crisis.  The CFTC also said the two-year waiting period restriction
won’t apply to contributions made before the end of the year.
Banks won’t need to register their swap-dealing units until Dec.
31 at the earliest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
