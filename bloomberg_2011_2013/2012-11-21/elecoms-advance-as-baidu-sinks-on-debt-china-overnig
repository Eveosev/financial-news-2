Chinese equities  climbed in  New
York , led by telecommunications stocks, on speculation the
confirmation of future political leaders is stoking investment
in the nation’s assets.  The  Bloomberg China-US Equity Index (CH55BN)  of the most-traded
Chinese shares in the U.S. gained 1 percent to 91.54 yesterday,
paring the first monthly drop since July to 2.5 percent.  China 
Telecom Corp. rose after Ji-Asia Research Ltd. raised it to buy,
while China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. traded at a premium to Hong
Kong for a third day.  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , owner of China’s most popular
search engine, sank after selling $1.5 billion of debt.  YY Inc. (YY) 
jumped after raising $81.9 million in the first U.S. initial
share sale by a Chinese company in seven months.  The China-US gauge has gained 2.1 percent since a new
generation of leaders were named on Nov. 15 to manage the
world’s second-largest economy at this month’s Communist Party
congress. Chinese equity funds have posted inflows for 10
straight weeks to Nov. 14, data compiled by EPFR Global show,
and the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  has rebounded after dropping
below its key 2,000 level yesterday and on Nov. 19.  “China’s recent power transition provides some clarity
that helps the market,” Charlie Awdry, a portfolio manager for
Henderson Global Investors’ 500 million pound ($800 million)
China Opportunities Fund, said in a phone interview from  London 
yesterday. “The appetite for Chinese stocks has increased.”  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., advanced 1.1 percent to $36.58
yesterday, erasing a 1 percent loss on Nov. 20. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.2 percent to 1,391.03 as a cease-fire
between  Israel  and the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas was
reached over fighting in the  Gaza Strip .  ‘Technical Bounce’  China’s Shanghai Composite index of domestic shares added
1.1 percent to 2,030.32 by the close of trading, after sliding
to as low as 1,995.17. It’s only a matter of time before the
measure closes below 2,000, according to Hao Hong, managing
director for research at Bank of China Communications Co., the
nation’s fifth-largest lender by assets.  While the index of so-called A-shares is due for a
“technical bounce,” the Shanghai Composite may fall between 5
percent and 10 percent, Hong Kong-based Hong said by e-mail
yesterday. Hong was the only strategist among 13 brokerages
surveyed by Bloomberg at the start of the year to forecast
declines for Chinese stocks in 2012. The Shanghai Composite has
slipped 7.7 percent this year.  The index is falling at a “measured speed” probably
because of government intervention in the market, Hong said. The
2,000 level “doesn’t seem like a final bottom,” he said.  China Telecom  The Shanghai gauge trades for 8.6 times estimated earnings
over the next 12 months, compared with a multiple of 10.7 for
 Brazil ’s  Bovespa Index (IBOV) , 5.3 for  Russia ’s Micex Index and 13.8
for the BSE India Sensex Index. The valuation for the China-US
index was  12.6 times  yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  American depositary receipts of China Telecom, the
country’s biggest fixed-line phone carrier, rose 1.8 percent to
$54.73 in New York. Ji-Asia’s Hong Kong-based analyst Neil Juggins lifted his rating on the stock to buy from neutral
yesterday, after Credit Suisse AG revised its recommendation
last week to outperform from neutral.  China Telecom added a net 2.9 million mobile users in
October to 156 million, while fixed-line users declined by 1
million to 165 million, according to data from the Beijing-based
company published Nov. 20.  New Horizon  ADRs of China Unicom, the nation’s second-largest mobile-
phone carrier, advanced 1.5 percent to $15.35 yesterday. The
ADRs, each representing 10 underlying shares in Unicom, traded
0.5 percent above its  Hong Kong  stock, the third trading day
they have posted a premium.  Hong Kong-based China Unicom will buy Unicom New Horizon
from its parent company, Unicom Group. New Horizon owns
telecommunications network assets in 21 provinces and cities in
southern China, according to a statement yesterday to the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange. The purchase will be made in cash from
internal funds and the deal is expected to completed by the end
of this year, subject to a government approval, China Unicom
said yesterday.  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , the biggest of China’s three phone
companies, rose 2.7 percent to $56.15, the steepest increase in
the ADRs in four weeks. The provider added 3.71 million users to
its third-generation service last month for a total 79.31
million, according to a Nov. 20 statement.  Within Target  YY, a social network operator based in  Guangzhou , gained
7.7 percent to $11.31 in New York after the company sold ADRs
for $10.50 each in the initial public offering. YY is the third
Chinese company to complete an IPO in the U.S. this year,
compared with the 13 initial share sales completed in 2011 and
38 in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The price the ADRs
sold at was at the bottom end of YY’s $10.50 to $12.50 target
range.  Baidu slipped 0.9 percent to $93.24 in New York, after
earlier tumbling to a two-year low.  The Beijing-based company issued $1.5 billion of bonds
yesterday, according to a statement. Speculation Baidu will use
the cash to acquire mobile businesses that won’t be immediately
profitable drove declines in the stock, said Jeff Papp, a senior
analyst at Oberweis Asset Management Inc. in Lisle,  Illinois .  “The risk is everyone wants to move to the mobile business
but none of them has made money out of it yet,” Papp, who
doesn’t own Baidu, said by phone yesterday. “The dilemma for
Baidu is that they want to further cement their position in
mobile business, but they may not have a huge return on assets
right away.”  Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  gained 1.7
percent to 10,397.73 yesterday for the biggest one-day advance
since Nov. 14. Thirty-day  volatility  in the Bloomberg China-US
gauge rose to 18.64 yesterday, the highest since Oct. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
