Argentine authorities will meet
today with gasoline producers including  YPF SA (YPFD)  and  Petrobras
Argentina SA (PZE)  to revise soybean biodiesel regulation, La Nacion
reported, without saying how it got the information.  Small- and medium-sized biodiesel producers are seeking
incentives to better compete with larger companies such as Bunge
 Argentina  SA, Cargill Inc. and Aceitera General Deheza SA, the
Buenos Aires-based newspaper reported.  Argentina is the worldâ€™s largest exporter of soybean
biodiesel and mixes 7 percent of the fuel with regular diesel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
