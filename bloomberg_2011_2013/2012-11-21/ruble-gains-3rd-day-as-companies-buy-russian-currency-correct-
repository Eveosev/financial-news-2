(Corrects headline to say currency bought was rubles.)  The ruble strengthened for a third
day as companies bought the currency to pay taxes, offsetting
earlier losses that resulted from a paring of risk appetite
after European officials failed to agree on a debt-reduction
package for  Greece .  The ruble appreciated 0.3 percent against the dollar to
31.2100 by 3:42 p.m. in Moscow, after falling as much as 0.5
percent. It gained 0.4 percent versus the euro to 39.9507 and
added 0.4 percent against the central bank’s euro-dollar target
basket.  The beginning of the tax period “offers considerable
support for the national currency,” Alexei Egorov, an analyst
at Moscow-based OAO Nomos Bank, said by e-mail. The ruble had
weakened after “the issue of granting Greece a new tranche of
financial aid remained open,” Egorov said.  Companies are buying the ruble ahead of payouts to the
government next week including mineral extraction and profit
taxes, which Egorov estimates at about 400 billion rubles ($12.8
billion). With creditors led by  Germany  refusing to put up fresh
money or offer debt relief, the finance chiefs were unable to
scrape together enough funds from other sources to help
alleviate Greece’s debt burden, set to hit 190 percent of gross
domestic product in 2014.  Europe  is  Russia ’s main trade partner.  Non-deliverable forwards showed the ruble at 31.7253 per
dollar in three months compared with 31.7615 yesterday.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries dropped one basis point to 194,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. An index
of five-year government bond yields fell 17 basis points to
6.7848 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
