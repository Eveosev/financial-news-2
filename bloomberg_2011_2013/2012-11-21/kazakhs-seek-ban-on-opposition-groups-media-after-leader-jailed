Kazakhstan ’s prosecutors asked a
court to ban as extremist opposition groups and media outlets
including the  Alga  party after its leader  Vladimir Kozlov  was
sentenced to 7 1/2 years in prison for fomenting violence.  Prosecutors yesterday asked an Almaty court to shut down
Alga and the country’s Halyk Maidany movement, Nurdaulet
Suindikov, a spokesman for the Prosecutor General’s Office in
Astana, said in a  statement  e-mailed today. The authorities also
want to halt the distribution of eight newspapers and 23
websites controlled by the Respublika group and close outlets
including Vzglyad newspaper,  K+  television channel and  Stan.tv 
portal, according to the statement.  Kozlov, in jail since January, was sentenced to prison last
month after facing accusations of fomenting violence in December
among striking oil workers in western Kazakhstan, where at least
14 people died in the worst unrest since the ex-Soviet republic
won independence two decades ago.  The conviction of Kozlov and others established the
“extremist character” behind unregistered public groups and
several media outlets, Suindikov said.  Yermukhambet Yertysbayev, an adviser of President  Nursultan Nazarbayev , has said former BTA Bank Chairman  Mukhtar Ablyazov 
used the money embezzled from the defaulted lender to sponsor
Alga and Golos Respubliki newspaper to lead calls for large-
scale protest actions, according to an interview published in
the Liter newspaper on Aug. 3, 2011.  Locksley Ryan, a spokesman for Ablyazov, denied at the time
that BTA funds were used to sponsor the opposition party and its
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
