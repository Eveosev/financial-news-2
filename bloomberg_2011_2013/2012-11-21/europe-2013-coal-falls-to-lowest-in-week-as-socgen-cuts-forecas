European coal for next-year delivery
declined to the lowest level in more than a week as Societe
Generale SA cut its price forecasts.  Thermal coal for delivery next year to Amsterdam, Rotterdam
or Antwerp dropped as much as 0.6 percent to $95.50 a metric
ton, according to broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Thatâ€™s the
lowest level since Nov. 13.  Year-ahead coal in  Europe  will average $103.60 a metric ton
next year, down 8 percent from the previous forecast made in
September, Paolo Coghe, an analyst for the bank in Paris, said
today in an e-mailed report. The 2015 contract will average
$110.3 next year, down 8 percent from the earlier estimate as
global oversupply and ailing global demand cap prices.  Bloomberg tracks information from ICAP Plc, GFI Group Inc.,
