Portugal ’s borrowing costs rose as
the government sold a combined 2 billion euros ($2.56 billion)
of three-, six- and 18-month bills in its last debt auction for
this year.  The nation sold 1.2 billion euros of securities due in May
2014 at an average yield of 2.99 percent, compared with 2.967
percent at a previous auction of 18-month bills on Sept. 19, the
debt management agency said. Investors submitted bids for 1.9
times the amount allotted, down from 2.4 times in September.  The agency sold 500 million euros of six-month bills at
2.169 percent, up from 1.839 percent on Oct. 17. It sold 300
million euros of three-month securities at 1.936 percent, versus
1.366 percent on Oct. 17.  “Portugal sold all the debt it aimed to sell in this last
auction of 2012, which is always good news,” Filipe Silva, who
manages the equivalent of $76 million at Banco Carregosa SA in
Oporto, northern Portugal, wrote in a note to clients. “The
increase in rates was not a total surprise because the secondary
market was already demonstrating that increase in yields in the
last few weeks.”  Notes Gain  Two-year notes  gained for a fourth day, with the yield
falling 27 basis points, or 0.27 percentage point, to 4.75
percent at 1:55 p.m. in  London . The yield is still above this
year’s low of 3.89 percent set on Oct. 8.  The  10-year rate  dropped 22 basis points to 7.97 percent
after falling to 7.95 percent, the lowest since Oct. 26. The
extra yield investors demand to hold the securities instead of
similar-maturity German bunds shrank to as little as 6.52
percentage points today from a record 16.47 percentage points on
Jan. 31.  Prime Minister  Pedro Passos Coelho  is battling a deepening
recession as he raises taxes to meet the terms of a 78 billion-
euro aid plan from the European Union and the International
Monetary Fund. Portugal aims to regain access to bond markets by
September 2013 and Passos Coelho has said if the country can’t
do that for “external reasons,” it would be able to rely on
continued support from the IMF and the EU.  Portugal in April 2011 followed Greece and Ireland in
requesting a bailout. European finance ministers failed to agree
on a debt-reduction package for Greece at a meeting that ended
early today in Brussels.  The IGCP, as the debt agency is known, said on Nov. 15 the
total indicative amount for today’s auctions would be between
1.75 billion euros and 2 billion euros. It also said a bill
auction scheduled for Dec. 19 would be scrapped.  The debt agency on Oct. 3 exchanged bonds maturing in
September next year for securities due in 2015, reducing its
repayment burden for 2013 as it plans to regain access to long-
term debt markets.  European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said on Sept.
6 that debt purchases may be considered for euro-area countries
currently under bailout programs, such as  Greece , Portugal and
Ireland, when they regain bond-market access.  To contact the reporter on this story:
