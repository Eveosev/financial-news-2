Chelsea named former Liverpool coach
Rafael Benitez as interim manager, replacing the fired Roberto
Di Matteo.  Benitez, 52, will manage the Blues for the remainder of the
season, Chelsea said in a statement on its website.  Di Matteo, 42, was fired earlier today after a 3-0 loss at
Juventus last night left the Blues on the brink of elimination
from the Champions League, a competition they won in May.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
