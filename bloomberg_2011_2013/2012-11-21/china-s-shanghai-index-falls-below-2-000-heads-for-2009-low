China’s  stocks  climbed the most in
three weeks, with the  Shanghai  Composite Index rebounding from a
drop below the 2,000 level, on speculation the government will
lower reserve-ratio requirements to boost investor confidence.  The  Shanghai index  jumped in the last hour of trade, adding
1.1 percent to 2,030.32 at the close. The index slid by as much
as 0.7 percent to 1,995.17, the second time this week it fell
below 2,000. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  added 1.4 percent to 2,194.90.
The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index rose 1.7 percent.  There is speculation “China’s central bank will cut the
reserve-ratio requirement from Nov. 25,”  Li Jun , a strategist
at Central China Securities Co. in Shanghai, said in a phone
interview. “There’s no basis for the speculation so we don’t
know if it’s true. It could be a technical rebound as well.”  Sinolink Securities Co. led a rally for  brokerages  after
the China Securities Journal said a new rule that lowers the
benchmark for calculating risk capital reserves may free up 50
billion yuan ($8 billion) for the industry. China said it will
waive some requirements for foreign investors to make it easier
to bring money into and out of the country. Yanzhou Coal Mining
Co. rose the most in a month, sending a measure of energy
producers to the second-biggest advance among industry groups.  Calls to the central bank’s news department today seeking
comment on the reserve-ratio speculation weren’t immediately
answered. The People’s Bank of China will probably keep the
reserve ratio for large lenders at 20 percent, based on the
median estimate of economists in a Bloomberg News survey
conducted Nov. 14-19. That compares with the half-point cut
projected last month. The central bank has cut  interest rates 
twice since early June and lowered reserve ratios three times
from last November.  Financials Rally  A gauge of financial companies including banks and
brokerages in the CSI 300 rose 1.8 percent, the most among 10
industry groups. Industrial Bank Co. added 1.6 percent to 12.50
 yuan . Huaxia Bank Co. gained 1.8 percent to 8.48 yuan. Sinolink
Securities, based in Chengdu, jumped 4 percent to 15.77 yuan.
Hong Yuan Securities, based in Urumqi, surged 5.1 percent to
17.57 yuan.  A new rule for brokerages that lowers the benchmark for
calculating risk capital reserves and net  capital requirements 
may free up capital for the industry, the China Securities
Journal reported, citing an unidentified China Securities
Regulatory Commission official.  Yanzhou Coal led gains for producers of the fuel, rising
2.3 percent to 6.92 yuan. China Shenhua Energy Co., the largest
coal producer, advanced 1.5 percent to 21.68 yuan.  The Shanghai Composite earlier slid as much as 0.7 percent
to 1,995.17 on concern the government will resume share sales.
 China ’s securities regulator will conduct its first review of a
share-sale application in more than a month today.  Psychological Support  Trading volumes in the Shanghai Composite were 17 percent
lower than the 30-day average, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Thirty-day volatility in the Shanghai Composite was
at 12.6, compared with this year’s average of 17.1.  The Shanghai index has slumped 7.7 percent this year amid
concern the nation’s new leadership may slow efforts to reduce
the government’s grip on the economy, which expanded at the
slowest pace in more than three years last quarter. The  Shanghai
Composite (SHCOMP)  is valued at 9.7 times reported earnings, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  “The 2,000 level provides psychological support,” said
Zhang Haidong, an analyst at Tebon Securities Co. in Shanghai.  The Shanghai gauge dropped to 1,995.72 on Nov. 19 before
rallying in the final hour of trading to close 0.1 percent
higher. The rebound may have been spurred by government-backed
buying of stocks “but I don’t think anybody knows,”  Richard Ross , a technical strategist at  Auerbach Grayson  said by phone
in  New York  on that same day.  Targeting 1,700  Foreign investors will be exempt from needing regulatory
pre-approval for opening bank accounts, remitting profits abroad
and transferring money between different domestic accounts
starting Dec. 17, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
said today on its website. The changes are aimed at “making it
easier for investors,” SAFE said.  The Shanghai index first broke above 2,000 in July 2000 and
almost tripled to 6,092.06 on Oct. 16, 2007, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg dating to 1991. Demand for equities surged
in that time amid average annual economic growth of 10.8
percent, luring Shanghai public offerings from  Industrial &
Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. and PetroChina Co.  The index will likely fall to 1,700, a 15 percent drop from
yesterday’s close, after it broke through a triangular
consolidation trading pattern, according to Chart Partners.  The Shanghai measure’s slide below “big resistance” at
2,100 and the break of the triangle foreshadow a retreat to
1,700 in the “medium term” and possibly to 1,500,  Thomas Schroeder , Bangkok-based managing director at Chart Partners,
wrote in an e-mailed response to questions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
