Soybeans declined for the first time
in three days on speculation rains in parts of Brazil may
improve planting prospects in the world’s largest grower and
exporter after drought cut the output in the U.S.  The contract for delivery in January lost as much as 0.6
percent to $14.045 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade,
before trading at $14.0725 at 10:32 a.m. Singapore time.  More than 50 millimeters of rain fell in some soybean and
cotton growing areas from Mato Grosso to  Minas Gerais  in the
week to Nov. 17, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said in its
weekly crop  bulletin  yesterday. The nation’s soybean and corn
growing areas have mostly favorable conditions for planting and
early development, Telvent DTN Inc. said yesterday.  “All eyes are certainly on the corn and soybean crop in
 South America ,”  Michael Creed , an agribusiness economist at
National Australia Bank Ltd., said by phone from Melbourne
today. “That’s a large swing factor as far as crops are
concerned.” Favorable weather would remove some of risks to
production, he said.  Corn for delivery in March slipped 0.1 percent to $7.4625 a
bushel in Chicago, while wheat for delivery in the same month
was unchanged at $8.605 a bushel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
