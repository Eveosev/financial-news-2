OAO Rosneft (ROSN) ,  Russia ’s largest oil
company, began to receive responses from banks as it seeks to
raise about $32.5 billion of loans to fund its acquisition of
TNK-BP, according to four people with knowledge of the deal.  Banks have each been asked to commit $1.75 billion to a
two-year bridge loan of as much as $24.5 billion and $500
million to a $8 billion, five-year facility, said the people,
who asked not to be identified because the terms are private. As
many as 15 non-Russian lenders are expected to commit to the
state-run firm’s request, said the people.  The Moscow-based energy company plants to get banks to sign
initial terms on the deal by the end of the year and for the
transaction to be completed in the first quarter of 2013, the
people said.  A Rosneft press official, who asked not to be identified,
citing company policy, declined to comment on the deal.  Rosneft is to pay about $55 billion for TNK-BP after
agreeing to buy stakes held by  BP Plc (BP/)  and a consortium of
billionaires known as AAR. Rosneft has offered BP $17.1 billion
in cash and 12.8 percent of its stock while AAR is set to
receive $28 billion in cash, it said Oct. 22. The Rosneft board
approved the deal earlier today.  Russia-based banks will provide additional funding to help
raise remaining cash for the bid, the people said.  Rosneft plans to replace about 70 percent of the bridge
loan with bonds and the rest with longer-term loans, two of the
people said. The shorter loan is structured so it reduces by 40
percent after the first year, the two people said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
