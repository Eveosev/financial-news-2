An explosion on a bus in Tel Aviv
left at least 10 people injured, Israeli  Army Radio  reported.  The blast occurred near the military headquarters in the
Israeli commercial hub. A witness who wasn’t identified told
Channel Two that it was a powerful explosion and many were hurt.
Police spokesman  Micky Rosenfeld  said the cause of the blast
wasn’t immediately clear.  The explosion comes as the conflict between Israel and
Palestinian militants in the Gaza Strip enters a second week,
with Israeli planes carrying out airstrikes and the Gaza-based
groups firing rockets. More than 130 Palestinians and five
Israelis have been killed, officials say.  Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , who visited Jerusalem
and the West Bank today, and Egypt’s President Mohamed Mursi are
leading international efforts to broker a cease-fire accord.  To contact the reporter on this story:
