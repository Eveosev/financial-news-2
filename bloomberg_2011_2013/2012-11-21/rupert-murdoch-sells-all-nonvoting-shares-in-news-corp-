News Corp. (NWSA)  Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer  Rupert Murdoch  sold all of his nonvoting Class
A shares in the company, retaining his voting stake.  Murdoch sold 418,631 shares on Nov. 20 for $23.87 to $24.01
each for a total of more than $10 million, according to a  filing 
to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The sale was for
estate-planning purposes, according to a person with direct
knowledge of the situation who asked not to be named because the
matter is sensitive.  Murdoch still holds the company’s largest voting stake,
with 40 percent of  Class B (NWS)  shares. That control makes it
difficult to enact board changes that differ from his wishes.
 Prince Alwaleed bin Talal , a friend of the Murdoch family, owns
an additional 7 percent of voting shares.  Some investors criticized that dual-class structure at the
company’s annual meeting last month. The company is still
seeking to move past a hacking scandal that erupted at the
company’s U.K. newspapers last year. Rebekah Brooks, who was
head of News Corp.’s U.K. unit, was charged in a bribery probe
related to the company’s newspapers, police said yesterday.  News Corp.’s Class A shares fell less than 1 percent to
$23.82 at the close in New York before the filing was posted.
The shares have risen 34 percent this year.  Julie Henderson , a spokeswoman for News Corp., declined to
comment on Murdoch’s selling of shares.  To contact the reporter on this story:
