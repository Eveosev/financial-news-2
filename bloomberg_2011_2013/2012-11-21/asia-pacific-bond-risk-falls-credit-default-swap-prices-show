The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx  Japan  index decreased 4 basis points to
180 as of 9:22 a.m. in  Tokyo , Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark is on track for its lowest close in more than two
months, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
140 as of 11:27 a.m. in Sydney, according to  Australia & New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  The measure is on course for the
lowest close in two weeks, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan fell 1.5 to 121 as of 8:28 a.m. in Hong
Kong,  Credit Agricole SA (ACA)  prices show. The gauge is set for its
lowest close since Nov. 8, according to CMA, which is owned by
McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the
privately negotiated market.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
credit quality. A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
