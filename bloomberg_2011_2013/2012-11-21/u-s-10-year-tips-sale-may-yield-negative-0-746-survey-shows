The government’s $13 billion auction
of 10-year inflation-indexed notes may draw a yield of negative
0.746 percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg
News survey of eight of the Federal Reserve’s 21 primary
dealers.  The Treasury Inflation Protected Securities, which mature
in July 2022, yielded negative 0.769 percent in trading before
the auction. Bids are due by 11:30 a.m.  New York  time.  The last offering of 10-year TIPS, a $13 billion sale on
Sept. 20, drew a record low yield of negative 0.75 percent, the
fifth consecutive time an auction of the securities yielded less
than zero.  TIPS pay interest at lower rates than nominal Treasuries on
a principal amount that’s linked to the Labor Department’s
consumer price index.  The September sale’s bid-to-cover ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.36, the lowest since April 2009 and compared with an average
of 2.72 for the past 10 sales.  Indirect bidders, a category of investors that includes
foreign central banks, bought 43.8 percent of the securities at
the September auction, compared with 44 percent at the July
sale. The average for the past 10 offerings is 40 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 7.7 percent of the
notes at the last sale, versus 16 percent in July and an average
of 14 percent at the past 10 auctions.  TIPS Returns  U.S. inflation-linked debt maturing in 10 or more years has
returned 12 percent this year, compared with a 7.2 percent gain
in the broader TIPS market and a 2.4 percent advance in the
overall Treasury market, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch indexes.  The auction is the Treasury’s only offering of notes or
bonds this week. It will raise $13 billion of new cash, as there
are no maturing securities held by the public.  Primary dealers trade government securities with the
central bank and are obligated to participate in Treasury
auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
