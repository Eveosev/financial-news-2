Indonesia ’s rupiah fell for a fifth
day as concern Southeast Asia’s largest economy hasn’t been able
to rein in its current-account deficit damped demand for the
nation’s assets. Government bonds were little changed.  Overseas investors sold $34 million more local shares than
they bought in the first two days of the week, exchange data
show, while the benchmark stock index fell for a third day. Bank
Indonesia sees a current-account shortfall of 2.2 percent of
gross domestic product in the fourth quarter, compared with 2.1
percent in the preceding three months, Perry Warjiyo, executive
director for economic research and monetary policy, said Nov. 13.  “Capital inflows are very limited,” said Nurul Eti Nurbaeti, head of treasury research at PT Bank Negara Indonesia
in Jakarta. “There is still attention from foreign investors on
our current-account deficit.”  The rupiah declined 0.1 percent to 9,643 per dollar as of
9:43 a.m. in Jakarta, prices from local banks compiled by
Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, which measures
exchange-rate swings used to price options, held at 4.70 percent.  The yield on the government’s 7 percent notes due May 2022
was steady at 5.42 percent, according to prices from the Inter
Dealer Market Association. The rate has risen two basis points,
or 0.02 percentage point, this week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
