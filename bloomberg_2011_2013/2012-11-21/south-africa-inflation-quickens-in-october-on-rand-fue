South Africa ’s inflation rate rose
more than economists forecast to the highest in four months as a
weaker rand increased the cost of imports, boosting the case for
the Reserve Bank to keep borrowing costs unchanged tomorrow.  Inflation accelerated to 5.6 percent last month from 5.5
percent in September, Pretoria-based Statistics South Africa
said on its website today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey of 23 economists was 5.4 percent. Prices rose 0.6 percent
in the month.  “The bank has been expecting a food-price effect,” Elize Kruger, an economist at KADD Capital in Johannesburg, said in a
telephone interview. “It will reinforce an unchanged monetary
policy stance.”  South Africa’s  Reserve Bank  will leave the benchmark
repurchase rate at 5 percent, the lowest level in more than 30
years, as a weaker rand and rising food and fuel prices threaten
to push inflation higher, according to all 23 analysts surveyed
by Bloomberg. The central bank targets inflation of 3 percent to
6 percent.  The government has raised the price of gasoline by 12
percent in the past year as oil surged and the currency fell
against the dollar. Corn has gained 22 percent on the Chicago
Board of Trade in the same period. White corn, a staple in South
Africa, gained 14 percent in the second half of the year. The
rand dropped 9.2 percent this year, the second-worst performer
of 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  For every one percentage point decline in the currency, the
inflation rate rises as much as 0.2 percentage point, according
to Standard Bank Group Ltd.  The rand weakened 0.7 percent to 8.9070 a dollar at 10:22
a.m. in Johannesburg. The yield on the rand debt due in 2021
rose 2 basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.66 percent.
The yield on the forward-rate agreements due as soon as four
months rose 5 basis points to 4.9 percent after the data was
released, the biggest gain since Oct. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
