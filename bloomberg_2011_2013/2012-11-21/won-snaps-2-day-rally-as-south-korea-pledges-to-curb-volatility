South Korea ’s won fell for the first
time in three days after Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said the
government will act to curb volatility if needed. Sovereign
bonds were little changed.  The government is closely monitoring the  currency market ,
Bahk said in Seoul today. The yen weakened against the dollar
for a sixth day as data showed  Japan ’s exports contracted for a
fifth month. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said
yesterday failure to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff would pose
a “substantial threat” to economic recovery. The U.S. faces
$607 billion of automatic spending cuts and tax increases
scheduled to take effect in 2013.  The won fell 0.1 percent to 1,083.35 per dollar at the
close in Seoul, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It touched
1,080.95 yesterday, the strongest level since Sept. 9, 2011.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, slid three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 5.73 percent.  “There is caution against government intervention as
Bahk’s comments sounded as if the authorities are trying to
prevent the won from strengthening beyond the 1,080 per dollar
level,” said Han Sung Min, a Seoul-based currency trader for
Busan Bank. “Still, the weakening yen is triggering trades of
selling the yen and buying the won, which is supporting the
Korean currency.”  The yield on the government’s 2.75 percent bonds due
September 2017 was steady at 2.87 percent, Korea Exchange Inc.
prices show. The one-year interest-rate swap slipped one basis
point to 2.77 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
