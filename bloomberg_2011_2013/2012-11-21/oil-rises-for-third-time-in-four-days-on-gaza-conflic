Oil advanced for the third time in
four days as U.S. inventories fell unexpectedly and fewer
Americans filed applications for  unemployment benefits .  Prices increased as stockpiles of crude and oil products
dropped and  jobless claims  decreased by 41,000. Oil pared gains
after Israel and Hamas agreed to a cease-fire, reducing concern
that supplies would be disrupted.  “The inventory report is driving oil up,” said  Michael Lynch , president of Strategic Energy & Economic Research in
Winchester,  Massachusetts . “Certainly the fundamentals are
looking more bullish for oil. The cease-firing is taking some
geopolitical premium off the table.”  Crude oil for January delivery gained 63 cents, or 0.7
percent, to settle at $87.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The price is down 12 percent this year.  Brent for January delivery advanced $1.03, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at $110.86 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange
in  London .  Oil  inventories  decreased for the first time in three
weeks, down 1.47 million barrels to 374.5 million, the Energy
Department said. The median estimate of 11 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was a gain of 1 million.  Gasoline inventories  fell 1.55 million barrels to 200.4
million.  Distillate supplies , which include heating oil and
diesel, dropped 2.68 million to 112.8 million, the lowest level
in more than four years.  Report ‘Supportive’  “The report is supportive,” said  Tim Evans , an energy
analyst at Citi Futures Perspective in  New York . “We have
declines in each major category.”  The refinery  utilization rate  increased 1.5 percentage
points to 87.5 percent and  oil imports  dropped 1.3 percent to
7.77 million barrels a day, the second-lowest level this year.  Gasoline  demand  rose 1.2 percent in the four weeks ended
Nov. 16 to average 8.74 million barrels a day, the Energy
Department report showed.  “Demand is rising and that’s a good sign,” Lynch said.  Oil output  climbed by 1,000 barrels a day to 6.71 million,
the most since May 20, 1994. Production has increased for 11
weeks, the longest stretch of gains since at least 1990.  U.S. jobless claims fell to 410,000 in the week ended Nov.
17 as damage to the labor market caused by  Hurricane Sandy  began
to subside, the Labor Department reported. The number of
applications matched the median forecast of 48 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Rising Optimism  Oil also rose on signs of rising economic optimism. The
 Conference Board ’s gauge of the outlook for the next three to
six months increased 0.2 percent after a revised 0.5 percent
gain in September, the New York-based group said today.
Economists projected the October gauge would climb 0.1 percent,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The Bloomberg monthly consumer expectations index rose to 4
in November from minus 7. The share of households in the
Bloomberg survey projecting the economy will get better rose to
37 percent, the highest since March 2002.  “The  U.S. economy  is getting a little better,” said Tariq Zahir, a New York-based commodity fund manager at Tyche Capital
Advisors. “Geopolitical headlines are definitely the market
movers here.”  Oil dropped as much as 0.4 percent earlier as the truce
accord officially came into effect at 9 p.m. local time today
after Egyptian Foreign Minister Mohamed Amr and Secretary of
State  Hillary Clinton  announced it earlier at a news conference
in Cairo.  ‘Very Sensitive’  “Every time you hear something about a peace agreement,
the market will fall,” said  Phil Flynn , senior market analyst
at the Price Futures Group in  Chicago . “The oil market is very
sensitive to the Middle East.”  The conflict has threatened further instability in the
 Middle East  and North Africa, regions accounting for more than
35 percent of global crude production, according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Statistical Review of World Energy.  “There are concerns about oil supply, but the odds of a
wider dispute and the odds of an oil supply disruption are
relatively low,” Evans said.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 360,370
contracts as of 3:31 p.m. Volume totaled 607,214 contracts
yesterday, 14 percent higher than the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.5 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
