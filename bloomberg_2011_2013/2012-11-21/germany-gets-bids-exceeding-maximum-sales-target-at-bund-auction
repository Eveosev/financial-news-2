Germany  got bids exceeding its
maximum sales target at an auction of 10-year government bonds.  Investors bid for 4.908 billion euros of the securities,
versus the 4 billion-euro target, the Bundesbank said today in a
statement. The bunds were sold to yield 1.40 percent, down from
1.56 percent at the last auction of similar-maturity debt on
Oct. 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
