BP Plc (BP/)  shut down a system associated
with its Chicap pipeline near Mokena, Illinois, yesterday after
a spill.  Oil was discharged into a containment area and covered
about 1,000 square feet inside a berm, according to a  filing 
with the National Response Center. The incident occurred at a
tank farm, the filing showed.  A separate  filing  with the Illinois Emergency Management
Agency said an estimated 200 barrels of oil spilled from the
line. The release was halted and a vacuum truck, tanks and other
equipment were sent to the scene.  The Chicap Pipeline System includes a 360,000-barrel-a-day,
26-inch mainline from Patoka, Illinois, to the Mokena area. A
100,000-barrel-a-day, 16-inch lateral line runs from Mokena to
Lemont, Illinois, according to the company’s  website .  The Chicap line receives low sulfur and heavy crude from
the Capline and Woodpat pipes, an  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  system in
Patoka and an  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  pipeline system in Mokena, the
website showed.  U.S. companies must notify the response center if they
release hazardous substances in excess of reportable quantities,
according to the Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, commonly known as Superfund.
