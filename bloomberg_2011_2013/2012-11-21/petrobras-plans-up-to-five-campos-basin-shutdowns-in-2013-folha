Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PBR)  plans to
temporarily shut four or five platforms in the Campos Basin next
year for planned maintenance,  Folha de S. Paulo  reported on its
website.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
will shut the P-54 platform at the Roncador field in February
and the P-40 platform at the Marlim Sul field in April as part
of the maintenance program, Folha cited Solange da Silva Guedes,
a production manager at Petrobras, as saying. Each shutdown will
last about 15 days, Folha said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
