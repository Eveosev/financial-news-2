Reformulated gasoline declined in
the  New York  Harbor spot market after fuel inventories grew by
the most since June in the region and as Phillips 66 prepared to
start its Bayway refinery.  Stockpiles of motor fuel in the Central Atlantic region,
which includes New York Harbor, gained 1.43 million barrels to
23.7 million in the week ended Nov. 16, the biggest jump since
June 15, the Energy Department reported today. Phillips 66’s
238,000-barrel-a-day  refinery  in Linden,  New Jersey , is expected
to return to normal operations before the end of the month.  Reformulated gasoline to be blended with ethanol declined
1.63 cents to 6.75 cents a gallon over futures on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  at 2:15 p.m., the third consecutive daily
slide.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel  fuel was unchanged at 19.75 a
gallon over heating oil futures.  Phillips’s Bayway refinery, the largest facility near New
York Harbor, was restoring cooling system water pumps on Nov. 19
and was working to bring back steam before returning process
units to service, a person familiar with the situation said
yesterday.  Hurricane Sandy , which made landfall in southern New Jersey
on Oct. 29, primarily damaged electrical equipment at Bayway,
the company said in a statement on its  website  on Nov. 5.
Process units at the plant were “in good condition,” the
company said.  Conventional, 87-octane gasoline  on the U.S. Gulf Coast
advanced 0.25 cent to trade at a discount of 14 cents below
futures at 1:55 p.m. The region’s inventories fell 2.09 million
to 73.9 million last week, the Energy Department said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
