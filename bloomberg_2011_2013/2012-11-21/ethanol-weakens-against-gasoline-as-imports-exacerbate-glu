Ethanol futures in  Chicago  weakened
against gasoline as imports worsened a glut of the biofuel.  The grain-based additive’s discount to the motor fuel
expanded to 36.85 cents a gallon from 32.55 cents yesterday,
based on December futures prices. The difference between the two
was 99.8 cents on Sept. 28.  An Energy Department report released today showed  ethanol
imports  averaged 6,000 barrels a day in the week ended Nov. 16,
compared with none a year earlier, while ethanol-blended
gasoline made up 89 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, the
lowest level in nine weeks.  “Domestic production is down so that’s obviously getting
filled by Brazilian imports,” said Will Babler, a broker at
Atten Babler Risk Management LLC in Galena,  Illinois .  Denatured ethanol for December delivery fell 0.6 cent, or
0.3 percent, to settle at $2.381 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade. Prices have gained 8.1 percent this year.  Gasoline for December delivery advanced 3.7 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $2.7495 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract covers reformulated gasoline, made to be
blended with ethanol before delivery to filling stations.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 1 cent
to $2.485 a gallon and in Chicago the additive increased 1 cent
to $2.39, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast climbed 1 cent to $2.545 a gallon
and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel rose 0.5 cent to $2.48.  Ethanol Stockpiles  Stockpiles of the additive swelled 6 percent to 18.9
million barrels last week, the biggest weekly gain in 22 months,
while  production  fell 1.6 percent to 811,000 barrels a day, the
Energy Department report showed.  Corn for March delivery declined 2 cents, or 0.3 percent,
to $7.4525 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  The fuel is derived from sugarcane in  Brazil , the world’s
second-biggest ethanol producer, giving that country a
competitive edge over U.S. manufacturers because of cheaper
feedstock costs, Babler said.  Raw sugar for March delivery fell 1.3 percent to 19.64
cents a pound on ICE Futures U.S. The sweetener has plunged 16
percent this year compared with a 15 percent gain in corn.  “Sugar prices are low and corn prices are at the other end
of the spectrum,” Babler said.  A 54-cent-a-gallon tariff on Brazilian imports was allowed
to expire last year along with a 45-cent-a-gallon tax credit for
ethanol blenders.  Ethanol on the Brazilian spot market  is
fetching $2.04 a gallon, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Based on December contracts for corn and ethanol, producers
are losing 31 cents on each gallon of the fuel made, unchanged
from yesterday, excluding the revenue that can be pocketed from
the sale of dried distillers’ grains, a byproduct of ethanol
production that can be fed to livestock, according to data
collected by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
