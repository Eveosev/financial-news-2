U.K. Defense Secretary Philip
Hammond said he’s examining how the military may be able to
access pension funds to pay for private housing.  “We will explore models to directly access some of that
wealth or allow them to access it to collateralize borrowing,”
Hammond told a defense conference in  London  today.  Most service personnel live in publicly funded housing, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
