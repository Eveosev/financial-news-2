Japan’s  Kansai Electric Power Co. (9503) 
and Kyushu Electric Power Co. agreed to buy 1 million metric
tons of thermal coal from U.S.-based Oxbow Carbon LLC.  The Japanese power companies will start receiving coal from
Oxbow Carbon, based in  West Palm Beach , Florida, after November
under a one-year agreement,  Kansai Electric  said in a statement.
Kyushu Electric plans to purchase 600,000 tons, and Kansai
Electric will take the rest.  Kansai Electric and seven other Japanese power utilities
posted a combined loss of 674 billion yen ($8.2 billion) in the
six months ended Sept. 30 due to rising costs for running gas,
oil and coal plants to make up for lost nuclear power generation.
Kansai Electric and Kyushu Electric were among the utilities
most dependent on nuclear power.  The purchase would help the two Japanese utilities
diversify suppliers, as they currently purchase most of thermal
coal from Australia, Eiji Maekawa, general manager of Kansai
Electric’s oil and coal purchasing group, told reporters in
 Tokyo  today. Kansai Electric bought 3.9 million tons of thermal
coal last fiscal year, about 71 percent of which was from
Australia, Maekawa said.  About 66 percent of 6.2 million tons of thermal coal that
Kyushu Electric bought in the year ended March came from
Australia, and 22 percent came from  Canada , according to Tetsuo Shuto, assistant manager in the business promotion group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
