China  will actively take part in
negotiations on emission cuts for the aviation industry, the
country’s lead negotiator for Unitied Nations climate talks said
today at a briefing in Beijing.  Multiple measures in addition to carbon taxes and emission
trading systems should be implemented to cut emissions, Xie
Zhenhua, who is also a vice chairman of China’s National
Development and Reform Commission, said. He spoke at a briefing
today held ahead of  UN climate talks  scheduled for next week in
Doha, Qatar.  Increasing energy efficiency and energy savings can also
play a role in reducing emissions in the aviation and shipping
industries, Xie said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
