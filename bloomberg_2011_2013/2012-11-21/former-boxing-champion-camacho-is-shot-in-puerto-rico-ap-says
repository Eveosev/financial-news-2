Former world boxing champion Hector
“Macho” Camacho was shot and seriously wounded in his native
 Puerto Rico  yesterday, the  Associated Press  reported.  Camacho, 50, was taken to Centro Medico trauma center in
the Puerto Rican capital,  San Juan , where he was in critical but
stable condition, AP reported, citing Ernesto Torres, the
hospital’s director.  The bullet struck Camacho in the jaw and exited his head
before lodging in his right shoulder and fracturing two
vertebrae, AP cited Torres as saying. Camacho, who won junior
lightweight, lightweight and junior welterweight world titles in
the 1980s, was at risk of paralysis from the shooting, Torres
added, according to AP.  Camacho, who was born in Bayamon, part of the San Juan
metropolitan area, retired in 2010 with a 79-6-3 career record,
according to The Ring magazine’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
