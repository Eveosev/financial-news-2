Griffiths Energy International Inc.,
a company founded by late banker Brad Griffiths, is seeking to
sell shares in the first half of next year after shelving plans
to list in 2012, said people familiar with the matter.  Griffiths is working with  Royal Bank of Canada  to manage
the IPO, two of the people said, asking not to be named as the
deliberations are private. It may raise about $150 million, one
of the people said. The company had asked banks to pitch and may
appoint more managers, another person said.  In September, Griffiths  said  it raised $173.6 million
through a pre-IPO convertible bond due in 2017. The same month,
 Glencore International Plc (GLEN) , the world’s largest publicly traded
commodities supplier, agreed to pay $331 million for a stake in
an oil field development in  Chad  with Griffiths.  Calgary-based Griffiths was formed in 2009 by Brad
Griffiths, an investment banker who died in a boating accident
in July 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
