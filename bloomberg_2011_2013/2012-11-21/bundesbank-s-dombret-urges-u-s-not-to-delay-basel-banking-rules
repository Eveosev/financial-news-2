Bundesbank board member Andreas Dombret said U.S. policy makers shouldn’t delay the
implementation of global banking rules, known as Basel III.  “There is no alternative to implementing Basel III on a
global scale,” Dombret said today in a speech in  Frankfurt .
“In particular, I call on my colleagues in the U.S. not to
unexpectedly question the whole framework in the 11th hour --
after taking part in its negotiation during the entire
process.”  Boosting reserves as required by Basel III would help
prevent a repeat of taxpayer-funded rescues, while “separating
banking functions will not prevent future banking crises,”
Dombret said.  “I do not see a clear case for separating banking
functions,” he said. “Even if there were a clean
organizational separation, the interconnectedness of the
financial sector and the resulting systemic importance of
individual institutions would not be entirely eliminated.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
