Mexico ’s peso advanced for a fourth
day after a report showed U.S. new-home construction climbed to
a four-year high, boosting the economic outlook for the Latin
American country’s biggest trading partner.  The currency increased 0.4 percent to 13.0044 per  U.S.
dollar  at 4 p.m. in Mexico City. The peso’s 7.2 percent rally in
2012 is the biggest among the dollar’s 16 most-traded
counterparts tracked by Bloomberg.  U.S. housing starts rose 3.6 percent to an annual pace of
894,000, the fastest since July 2008, the Commerce Department
reported today in  Washington . The figure beat the median
estimate of 82 economists for a 840,000 starts. Mexico sends
about 80 percent of its exports to its northern neighbor.  “Higher growth in the U.S. impacts Mexico for their close
economic and financial relationship,” Flavia Cattan-Naslausky,
a  Stamford , Connecticut-based local markets strategist at RBS
Securities Inc., said in an e-mailed message.  Yields on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 5.49 percent, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.20 centavo to
139.71 centavos per peso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
