Jack Taylor  of Grinnell College
scored 138 points to break college basketball’s 58-year-old
single-game scoring record.  Taylor, a 22-year-old sophomore guard at the Division III
school in Grinnell,  Iowa , made 52 of 108 field-goal attempts
last night, including 27 3-pointers, in a  179-104 win  over Faith
Baptist Bible College.  The performance broke the National Collegiate Athletic
Association record of 113 points, set by Clarence “Bevo”
Francis of Division II Rio Grande in 1954.  Taylor, who played 36 of the 40 minutes, had 58 points by
halftime and later passed the Division III scoring record of 89,
set last year by teammate Griffin Lentsch, according to the
school’s website. In one stretch of the second half, Taylor
scored 28 straight points for the Pioneers, including seven 3-
pointers without a miss.  “That’s crazy, man,” Los Angeles Lakers All-Star guard
Kobe Bryant said when told about the feat, according to the
Associated Press. “I don’t care what level you’re at. Scoring
138 points is pretty insane.”  Bryant, who never played college basketball, scored 81
points in a 2006 National Basketball Association game, the
second most in league history. Wilt Chamberlain holds the NBA
record, scoring 100 points as a Philadelphia Warrior against the
 New York  Knicks on March 2, 1962 in Hershey,  Pennsylvania .  Taylor, a 5-foot-10, 170-pound player from Black River
Falls,  Wisconsin , also had three rebounds and three steals in
the win. He had no assists.  Grinnell’s next game is at home against William Penn
University of Iowa on Nov. 25.  To contact the reporter on this story:
