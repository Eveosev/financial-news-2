Konstantin Brownstein, head of
options trading at OAO Sberbank’s investment bank, left the
company along with a partner in equity sales Sukhrob Ibadov.  The two departed due to “organizational changes” and
“optimization of the structure and strengthening of the team,”
Timur Nasardinov, head of Moscow-based Sberbank’s equities
department, wrote in e-mailed comments today. Both decided to
“pursue other career opportunities” and left by “mutual
understanding,” he said.  Brownstein had worked at Troika Dialog, which Sberbank
bought in January and then re-branded Sberbank Investment
Banking, since 2005. He didn’t answer calls seeking comment.
Ibadov, who joined in 1999, did not return calls placed to his
office phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
