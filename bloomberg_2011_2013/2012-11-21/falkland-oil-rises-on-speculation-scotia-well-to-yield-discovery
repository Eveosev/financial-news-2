Falkland Oil & Gas Ltd. (FOGL) , the
explorer focused on the namesake South Atlantic islands, surged
in  London  on speculation that drilling at its Scotia well will
lead to a discovery.  The shares rose as much as 21 percent, the most since Sept.
12, and traded up 19 percent as of 12:21 p.m. in London.  Falkland Oil and its partners  Noble Energy Inc. (NBL)  and Edison
SpA are targeting about 1 billion barrels of oil at the Scotia
well. The company made the second gas discovery this year at its
Loligo well after  Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR)  said in July
that it found gas, including some liquids, south of the islands
 Margaret Thatcher  went to war to keep British in 1982.  “They’re close to the target depth on Scotia,” said Laura Loppacher, an analyst at Jefferies International Ltd. in London.
“What these kinds of stocks do best is speculation, and we may
get results shortly.”  Rockhopper Exploration Plc (RKH)  found a potentially commercial
oil discovery north of the archipelago two years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
