Iran has earned more than $112
million in eight months through the export of sea products, the
state-run  Mehr  news agency reported, citing Issa Golshahi, an
official with  Iran’s Fisheries Organization .  Iran exported 27,000 tons of sea products to countries
including the U.S., Canada,  Italy , Spain,  Egypt , Kuwait, the
United Arab Emirates, China and  South Korea  since the start of
the Iranian year on March 20, Golshahi said, without providing
details.  The value of exports by Iran’s fishery industry will
surpass $350 million in the current year compared with $210
million the year before, deputy Agriculture Minister Gholamreza
Razeqi said last month, according to Mehr.  Iran exported 4,000 tons of shrimp last year and plans to
ship a ton of caviar overseas this year, Razeqi has also said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
