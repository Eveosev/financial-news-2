The  African Development Bank  plans
to roll out a trade finance program of as much as $1.5 billion
by the end of the year to meet demand from smaller financial
institutions on the continent.  The institution’s $1 billion Trade Finance Facilitation
Program may be increased to $1.5 billion, Mohamed Kalif,
divisional manager at the Tunis-based bank, said in an interview
yesterday in Mauritius. “It’s going to the board of governors
on Nov. 28” for approval, he said at Trou aux Biches, north of
Port Louis, the capital. “We already have deals lined up.”  While major African banks have been able to raise funds
from  capital markets , second- and third-tier lenders are under
greater pressure to meet their clients’ needs as their costs are
higher, Kalif said.  The new program, which will operate for as long as four
years, replaces the 2009 $500 million Global Trade Liquidity
Program with about 200 financial institutions, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
