Magyar Telekom Nyrt., the Hungarian
unit of  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) , slid the most in more than three
months after the government increased a tax on cables, wires and
pipes.  The shares fell 2.2 percent to 397 forint at the close in
Budapest, the steepest slump since Aug. 9 and bringing the drop
in the past three days to 4.3 percent. The benchmark BUX stock
 index  fell 0.2 percent today, declining for a fifth day.  Parliament yesterday approved a levy of as much as 125
forint per meter on electricity, telecommunication, natural gas,
heating, water and wastewater infrastructure. The tax, which the
government earlier proposed to cap at 100 forint per meter, will
cost Magyar Telekom 9 billion forint ($41 million) to 11 billion
forint a year, the company said in a statement to the Budapest
Stock Exchange late yesterday.  “We expect the selling pressure in Magyar Telekom shares
to continue in the near term,” Gergely Palffy, a Budapest-based
analyst at  KBC Groep NV (KBC) , wrote in a research report today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
