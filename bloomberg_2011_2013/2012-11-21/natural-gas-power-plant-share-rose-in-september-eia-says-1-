U.S. electricity generators burned
17 percent more natural gas in September and cut coal use versus
a year ago, the Energy Department said today.  Power plants  consumed 834.3 billion cubic feet of gas
during the month, up from 712 billion in September 2011, the
department’s Energy Information Administration said in its
Electric Power Monthly  report . It represents 4.08 billion cubic
feet a day of additional gas demand.  Coal consumption fell 9.5 percent to 69.5 million tons in
September from 76.8 million a year earlier.  Total electricity  production  in the nation fell 1 percent
to 334.7 million megawatt hours versus September 2011. Gas-fired
plants accounted for 32 percent of the generation, up from 27
percent a year earlier, while coal’s share fell to 38 percent
from 42 percent during the same period, department data show.  “Almost all regions of the country saw an increase in
natural gas-fired generation when compared to September 2011,”
especially in the western, southeastern and central states, the
department said in its  Electricity Monthly Update  also released
today.  Output from coal plants fell in every state in the
continental U.S. except  Florida , where a “slight increase” in
coal use probably occurred because of refueling outages at two
nuclear plants, the department said.  Gas at  Henry Hub  in Erath,  Louisiana , the delivery point
for  New York  futures contracts, rose 46 percent to $2.96 per
million British thermal units in September from a low of $2.03
in April, the department said. Central Appalachian coal rose 2.2
percent to the equivalent of $2.74 per million Btu during the
same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
