Agellan Commercial Real Estate
Investment Trust (0623351D)  is seeking to raise about C$140 million ($140.5
million) in an initial public offering in Toronto to buy office
and industrial sites in  Canada  and the U.S., according to two
people familiar with the transaction.  Agellan will sell units for C$10 each, according to a Nov.
15 regulatory filing. The IPO is expected to be priced next
month, said the people, who declined to be identified because
the terms aren’t public.  Agellan was formed to own and operate industrial, office
and retail properties in the U.S. and Canada. The Toronto-based
REIT plans to use the proceeds to buy 23 properties comprising
47 buildings with about 4.2 million square feet of space, mostly
in Ontario and  Texas .  Derek Dermott, a former  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  investment banker,
was appointed president, and its properties will be managed by
Agellan Capital Partners, the company said in the statement. A
telephone message left with Dermott wasn’t immediately returned.  Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are
leading a group of banks on the sale.  To contact the reporter on this story:
