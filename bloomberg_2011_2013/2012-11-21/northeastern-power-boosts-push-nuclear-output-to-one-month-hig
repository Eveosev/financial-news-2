Power increases at northeastern
reactors including Constellation Energy Group Inc.’s Nine Mile
Point 2 and  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG) ’s Salem 2
lifted U.S.  nuclear production  to a one-month high.  Total U.S. generation increased by 0.7 percent to 77,830
megawatts, or 76 percent of capacity, the highest level since
Oct. 19, according to U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission data
compiled by Bloomberg. Output was 10 percent lower than a year
ago with 23 of 104 reactors offline.  Nine Mile Point 2, a 1,140-megawatt plant 6 miles (10
kilometers) northeast of Oswego,  New York , is operating at full
capacity, up from 53 percent yesterday. The reactor shut Nov. 15
for planned maintenance on a steam valve and repairs to the
switch yard, said Jill Lyon, a company spokeswoman based in
Scriba, New York.  Salem 2, a New Jersey reactor with a capacity of 1,130
megawatts, was operating at 29 percent of capacity, up from 20
percent yesterday. The unit shut for refueling and maintenance
on Oct. 14. Work was delayed for two days because of  Hurricane
Sandy , said Joe Delmar, a plant spokesman based in  Newark .  Constellation also boosted output at its Ginna reactor, a
498-megawatt unit near Rochester, New York. It was operating at
29 percent of capacity at 7:50 a.m. local time, according to
Maria Hudson, a company spokeswoman based in Ontario, New York,
up from 13 percent earlier today.  Northeastern nuclear-power generation increased 4.4 percent
to 20,111 megawatts, the highest level since Nov. 10, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Reactor maintenance shutdowns, usually undertaken in the
U.S. spring or fall when energy use is lowest, may increase
consumption of natural gas and coal to generate electricity. The
average refueling down time was 43 days in 2011, according to
the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
