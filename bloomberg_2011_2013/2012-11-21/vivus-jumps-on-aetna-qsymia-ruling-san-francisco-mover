Vivus Inc. (VVUS) , maker of the Qsymia
weight-loss medicine that won U.S. approval in July, jumped the
most in nine months after insurer  Aetna Inc. (AET)  cleared the way for
coverage of the obesity treatment.  Vivus rose 13 percent to $11.73 at the close of trading in
New York, for the Mountain View, California-based company’s
biggest single-day gain since Feb. 24, after Aetna said on its
 website  that Qsymia is “medically necessary.”  Qsymia this year joined Belviq, made by  Arena
Pharmaceuticals Inc. (ARNA)  and  Eisai Co. (4523) , as the first new obesity
medicines approved for the U.S. market since 1999. Aetna said
both drugs can be considered necessary, while coverage will
depend on a patient’s particular medical plan.  While diet drugs often produce only temporary benefits,
people who can’t lose weight through other methods may still
need the medications, the insurer said in a bulletin on its
website. “For these persons, the risk of physical dependence or
other adverse effects may present less of a risk than continued
obesity.”  Arena, based in San Diego, rose 3 percent to $9.20.  Aetna, the third-biggest health insurer by membership, is
based in Hartford,  Connecticut .  To contact the reporter on this story:
