Tiger Brands Ltd. (TBS) , South Africa’s
largest food company by market value, beat profit estimates for
the full year and said weak  consumer spending  will continue to
weigh on Africa’s largest economy.  Net income climbed 5 percent to 2.7 billion rand ($303
million) in the 12 months through September from a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue advanced 11 percent to 22.7 billion rand. Earnings per
share rose 4.6 percent to 16.72 rand, beating the median
 estimate  of 16.54 rand of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Tiger’s grocery division turned around this year,” Diane Laas, an equity analyst at Investec Asset Management, said by
phone from Cape Town. “Volume growth was achieved at the
sacrifice of some profitability as prices had to be realigned to
suit the current tough consumer market.”  South African consumers are under pressure amid
 unemployment  of 25.5 percent and economic growth that will slow
to 2.5 percent this year, the lowest since the 2009 recession,
according to government estimates. The  Reserve Bank  cut the
 benchmark lending rate  to a 30-year low of 5 percent on July 19
to support the economy.  Tiger Brands, the biggest bread and rice seller in  South
Africa , agreed to buy  Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU)  of Nigeria from
Dangote Industries Ltd. for 30.1 billion naira ($191 million) in
July as part of a plan to expand outside South Africa. Growth in
the rest of the continent was robust with Tiger’s operations
“contributing positively” to profit growth, the company said.  Tiger Brands  fell  1.4 percent to 274.07 rand in
Johannesburg by 12:40 p.m. About 65,000 shares, or 13 percent of
the daily average over the last three months, changed hands. The
 FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index (JALSH)  climbed for a third day, rising
0.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
