Getty Images Inc. lost a European
Union court appeal over its attempt to gain trademark protection
for the name of its photos.com service.  The EU’s General Court upheld a decision by the EU’s
trademark office to reject an application to protect the term
photos.com because the words were “devoid of distinctive
character,” according to a ruling today.  The case is T-338/11 Getty Images Inc. v. Office for
Harmonisation in the Internal Market.  To contact the reporter on this story:
