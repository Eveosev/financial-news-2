Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  and  United
Technologies Corp. (UTX) ’s Sikorsky have beaten  Finmeccanica SpA (FNC) ’s
AgustaWestland to supply helicopters to the Danish military.  The Danish government has opted for the MH-60R over the
AW159 Wildcat, the defense ministry said today in a statement on
its website. The nine rotorcraft will be delivered between 2016
and 2018, the ministry said.  The loss is a major setback for AgustaWestland, which was
the incumbent on the program. The MH-60Rs will start replacing
AgustaWestland Lynx helicopters in Danish operational service in
2017, the ministry said.  An AgustaWestland spokesman said the company had no
immediate comment.  Lockheed Martin, based in Bethesda,  Maryland , and Sikorsky
developed the MH-60R for the U.S. Navy and sold the system to
 Australia  last year. The companies have said  Saudi Arabia ,
Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Malaysia,  Singapore  and
Thailand are potential buyers. Thailand last year agreed to buy
the MH-60S, a sister model.  The MH-60R and AW159 also are competing for a contract in
 South Korea , with a decision scheduled for next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
