Abortions in the U.S. fell 5 percent
in 2009, the biggest annual drop since at least 2000, as the
rate of teenage pregnancies declined, health officials said.  A total of 784,507 abortions were reported in 2009, with a
ratio of 227 abortions for every 1,000 live births, the Atlanta-
based  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  said in a
report today.  The report  included the District of Columbia and
 New York  City while excluding seven states that didn’t provide
enough data.  The decline in abortions occurred as the U.S. birth rate
was falling for three straight years, dropping in 2010 to the
lowest level since 1987. Adolescent pregnancies plunged,
reflected in the lowest-ever teen birth rate in 2010 and an even
steeper decrease in teen abortions, the report authors said.  “Given that unintended pregnancy precedes nearly all
abortions, efforts to reduce the incidence of abortion need to
focus on helping women avoid pregnancies that they do not
desire,” the report’s authors wrote.  The data also showed more women have abortions early in
gestation, with the majority of terminations performed at less
than eight weeks. That’s when the risks for complications are
lowest, the authors wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
