Jamaica’s economy contracted 0.6
percent in the third quarter from the same period last year, led
by a drop in mining production, the  Finance Ministry ’s planning
agency said.  Economic growth for the Caribbean island will “remain
challenging” during the last three months of 2012 because of
damage from Hurricane Sandy, the agency  said  yesterday on its
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
