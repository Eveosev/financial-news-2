New York Times Co. (NYT)  Chairman and
Publisher Arthur Sulzberger Jr. said the lingering scandal at
the British Broadcasting Corp. has been a challenge for new
Chief Executive Officer  Mark Thompson , who used to run the  BBC .  “The British stuff hasn’t made things easy,” Sulzberger
said in a brief interview last night at an event held by the
Committee to Protect Journalists. “But Mark is a good man.”  Thompson joined the New York Times earlier this month after
a career at the BBC, which he led for eight years. The U.K.
broadcaster has been roiled by allegations that its popular host
Jimmy Savile sexually abused dozens of children while he worked
for the company. The BBC also killed a story last year by its
“Newsnight” program that would have brought the matter to
light, further raising concerns about a cover-up.  Thompson said he wasn’t aware of the abuse allegations and
didn’t participate in stopping “Newsnight” from airing the
segment. Savile died last year, before the scandal broke.  “I was not involved in any way in the decision-making
about the ‘Newsnight’ investigation into Savile,” Thompson said
in an interview last month.  Sulzberger didn’t elaborate on the issue yesterday, only
saying he was glad to have Thompson fill the CEO role, which was
vacant for almost a year.  “We are very happy to have him in the position after all
that time,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
