Gasoline futures pared gains after
the Energy Department reported inventories along the U.S. East
Coast rose last week.  The government said stockpiles in Padd 1, which includes
New York and  New Jersey , where  Hurricane Sandy  struck Oct. 29,
shutting refineries and terminals, climbed 1 million barrels to
46.1 million in the week ended Nov. 16. Total U.S. supplies fell
1.55 million barrels to 200.4 million. The median estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for a 1 million-barrel gain.  Gasoline for December delivery rose 2.83 cents, or 1
percent, to $2.7408 a gallon at 10:34 a.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . Prices were $2.7511 before the reportâ€™s
release at 10:30 a.m. in Washington.  Distillate supplies, which include heating oil and diesel,
sank 2.68 million barrels to 112.8 million in the seven days
ended Nov. 16, according to department data. Analysts estimated
a 1 million-barrel decrease, according to the survey.  December-delivery heating oil gained 4.23 cents, or 1.4
percent, to $3.0815 a gallon, from $3.0801 before the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
