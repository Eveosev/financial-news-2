Nampak Ltd. (NPK) , a South African
packaging company, said its full-year profit nearly doubled as
it ramped up expansion in fast-growing economies elsewhere in
Africa.  Net income rose 92 percent to 1.2 billion rand ($134
million) in the 12 months through September from a year earlier,
the Johannesburg-based company said today in a statement.
Revenue advanced 12 percent to 17.6 billion rand. Earnings per
share increased 90 percent to 1.97 rand, broadly in line with an
average  estimate  of 1.98 rand according to nine analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The strategy of investing in our core business in South
Africa and growing and investing in businesses across Africa
over the last three years is expected to enable the group to
further improve on performance in 2013,” the company said.  South  Africa ’s economic growth is expected to slow to 2.5
percent this year, the lowest since a 2009 recession, according
to government estimates. The decline has prompted many companies
to look to faster-growing African economies to boost growth.  Nampak raised the dividend 20 percent to 129.5 cents a
share. The shares rose 3.75 percent to 30.19 rand by 3:55 p.m.
in Johannesburg, the most on an intraday basis since Oct. 8.
About 900,000 shares changed hands, or 62 percent of the daily
average over the last three months.  The company said on Sept. 5 it is evaluating projects worth
$498 million outside South Africa over the next three to five
years. The company is considering investments worth $350 million
in West Africa and $120 million in Angola and  Mozambique , it
said.  Nampak’s trading profit from the rest of Africa increased
from 122 million rand to 316 million rand, primarily due to
operations in Angola and Zambia, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
