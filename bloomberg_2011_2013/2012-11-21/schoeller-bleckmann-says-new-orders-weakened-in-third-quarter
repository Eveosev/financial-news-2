Schoeller-Bleckmann Oilfield
Equipment AG (SBO) , a producer of gear to extract oil from hard-to-
reach places, said third-quarter new orders weakened and clients
may turn “temporarily cautious.”  The order backlog fell 9 percent to 190.3 million euros
($243 million) in the three months to September, the Ternitz,
Austria-based company said today in a  report . New orders
“slightly diminished” in the period, Schoeller-Bleckmann said.  “Given customers’ overly optimistic ordering behavior in
the first half of 2012 and the still unclear outlook for further
global economic development, a temporarily cautious spending
policy” of its customers “has to be taken into account,”
Schoeller-Bleckmann said.  Net income increased 46 percent to 19.65 million euros in
the period, up from 13.65 million euros a year earlier,
according to the producer.  Schoeller-Bleckmann fell as much as 2 percent in Vienna
trading and was 1.2 percent lower at 72.39 euros by 9:14 a.m.
That cut the stock’s gain this year to 5 percent.  The company had said in August that third-quarter orders
were “strong” after reporting record profit and sales in the
first half.  Schoeller-Bleckmann makes directional-drilling equipment to
extract crude on land and under water, and has benefited from
higher oil prices that justify bigger investments into
production in places that require more elaborate technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
