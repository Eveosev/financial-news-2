Azerbaijan, the largest oil producer
in the former Soviet Union after Russia and Kazakhstan, cut
crude exports in the first nine months as production declined.  The Caspian Sea nation saw oil exports fall 8 percent in
January through September to 28 million metric tons, the State
Statistics Committee based in the capital, Baku, said by e-mail.  Gas exports declined 9.6 percent to 4.6 billion cubic
meters, the statistics committee said.  Azerbaijan produced 32.7 million tons of oil through
September, a decline of 7.8 percent from the year-earlier
period, the State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar, said last
month. Gas production rose 0.4 percent to 6.5 billion cubic
meters,  Socar  said.  The country pumped 45.6 million tons of oil and 25.8
billion cubic meters of gas last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
