Greenlight Capital Re Ltd. (GLRE) , the
reinsurer that counts hedge-fund manager David Einhorn as its
chairman, rose the most since August as UBS AG raised its rating
on the firm to buy and said the stock will rebound from a slump.  Greenlight Re jumped 3.6 percent to 23.21 at 4 p.m. in New
York. Analysts led by Brian Meredith increased their price
target on the Cayman Islands-based insurer to $27 from $25.50.
The stock had dropped 5.4 percent this year through yesterday.  Einhorn established the reinsurer in 2004 and invests
premiums through an affiliate of his hedge fund Greenlight
Capital Inc. The firm is trading below book value, a measure of
assets minus liabilities, compared with a historical average of
about  22 percent higher  than that metric, the analysts said.  Greenlight Re “is a unique way to invest with the
successful hedge fund,” the analysts wrote in a note today.
They previously had a neutral rating on the stock.  The reinsurer has “largely addressed” underwriting losses
related to commercial vehicle policies it wrote in prior years,
the analysts said. The company’s third-quarter profit was hurt
after higher than expected claims costs on contracts protecting
dump trucks and garbage haulers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
