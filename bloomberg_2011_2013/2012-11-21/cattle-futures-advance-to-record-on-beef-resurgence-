Cattle futures surged to a record on
signs of increasing demand for U.S. beef.  Meatpackers processed 259,000 cattle in the first two days
of this week, up 7 percent from a week earlier, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show. Beef demand is picking up on the East
Coast as consumers boost purchases in the aftermath of  Hurricane
Sandy , Jason Roose, an analyst at U.S. Commodities Inc. in  West
Des Moines ,  Iowa , said in a telephone interview.  “We’ve found good resurgence in the beef demand, and we’re
still looking at the tight numbers giving us strong support in
the cattle market,” Roose said.  Cattle futures for February delivery rose 0.7 percent to
$1.31475 a pound at 10:05 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Earlier, the most-active contract reached a record
$1.31725. The commodity headed for the fifth straight gain, the
longest rally since mid-May.  Through yesterday, cattle gained 7.5 percent this year.  Wholesale  beef  gained 0.1 percent yesterday to $1.9428 a
pound, the highest this month, USDA data show.  Feeder-cattle futures for January settlement advanced 0.9
percent to $1.473 a pound in  Chicago .  Hog futures for February settlement increased 0.4 percent
to 88.075 cents a pound. The price headed for the fifth straight
gain, the longest rally since early June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
