Farm income in Ireland fell 22
percent in 2012 after unfavorable weather cut production and
costs rose, the Irish Farmers’ Association said.  Average farm  income  fell to about 18,000 euros ($23,000),
the Dublin-based association said today in a statement on its
website. Ireland saw above-normal  rainfall  this summer. More
than 90 percent of farm income will come from direct payment
programs in 2012, the IFA said. The European Union’s Common
Agricultural Policy programs contribute about 1.6 billion euros
to Irish farms annually, and potential funding cuts “would have
a directly negative impact on incomes and production,” it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
