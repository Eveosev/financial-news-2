ZUE SA (ZUE) , a Polish rail construction
company, decreased to the lowest in more than two months after
BRE Bank SA decreased its share-estimate, citing rising costs.  The  stock  declined as much as 4.7 percent, and traded down
2.3 percent at 5.88 zloty, the weakest since Sept. 4, as of 2:17
p.m. in Warsaw. Turnover amounted to 63 percent of the daily
average from the last three months, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  BRE cut the company’s share-estimate to 6.2 zloty from 7
zloty and maintained its hold recommendation. ZUE’s “margins in
the third quarter disappointed,” Maciej Stoklosa, a Warsaw-
based analyst at BRE said in a note today. Contracts secured in
2009 and 2010 are “negatively affected” by rising costs,
Stoklosa said. “For the whole industry 2012 is lost.”  Zue’s net income fell to 4.5 million zloty ($1.39 million)
in the first nine months of 2012 from 11.2 million zloty a year
ago, the Krakow, Poland-based company said in a filing on Nov.
