Brazil  raised its gold reserves for
a second month in October to the highest level in more than 11
years as emerging nations from Kazakhstan to  Russia  boosted
holdings by more than 40 metric tons.  Brazil’s holdings expanded 17.2 tons last month to 52.5
tons, the most since January 2001, according to data on the
International Monetary Fund’s website. The country’s 1.7-ton
purchase in September was the first since December 2008.
Kazakhstan’s holdings increased 7.5 tons, Russia added 0.4 ton
and  Turkey ’s reserves rose 17.5 tons, the data show. Germany,
the second-biggest holder, after the U.S., cut gold holdings by
4.2 tons, the first reduction since June.  Central banks have been expanding reserves as the metal
heads for a 12th straight annual gain and investors hold a
record amount in bullion-backed  exchange-traded products , data
compiled by Bloomberg show. Nations bought 373.9 tons in the
first nine months of the year and full-year additions will
probably be in the “bottom end” of 450 to 500 tons, the
London-based World Gold Council estimates.  “This is a chunky purchase by a central bank, and the gold
market will likely sit up and pay attention,”  Edel Tully , an
analyst at UBS AG in London, wrote today in a report, referring
to Brazil’s addition. “Today’s news confirms much of the market
chatter at the time that official sector buying was taking place
and was one of the key factors that gave prices a reasonable
floor last month.”  Germany’s Reserves  Germany holds 3,391.4 tons, the IMF data show. The
Bundesbank declined to comment on the past month’s gold
reserves, spokeswoman Susanne Kreutzer said, adding that the
central bank reserves 7 tons a year to sell to the Finance
Ministry for minting. The year started on Sept. 27, she said.
The Bundesbank sold about 0.7 ton to the finance ministry in
June and 4.7 tons in October 2011 to mint commemorative coins.  Gold for immediate delivery was little changed at $1,726.99
an ounce by 10:57 a.m. in  London . It’s gained 10 percent this
year. Holdings in gold-backed ETPs reached a record 2,604.9 tons
yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “The IMF figures showed continued strong buying by central
banks,” said Dan Smith, a commodities analyst at Standard
Chartered Plc in London. “This continues the trend of recent
months and we expect this to support gold prices.”  Turkey’s bullion holdings have increased due to it
accepting gold in its reserve requirements from commercial
banks. Belarus expanded holdings by 0.1 ton in October and
 Mexico  reduced them by 0.2 ton, the IMF data show.  Gold accounts for about 0.5 percent of Brazil’s total
reserves and 20 percent of Kazakhstan’s, according to the World
Gold Council. That compares with more than 70 percent for the
U.S. and  Germany , the biggest bullion holders, the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
