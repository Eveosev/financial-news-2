Jockey Frankie Dettori was
temporarily suspended from horseracing in  France  today after his
positive test for a banned substance at Longchamp in September,
Sky reported.  The medical committee of France Galop, the country’s racing
authority, considered the case yesterday and heard evidence from
the 41-year-old jockey via a conference call.  Having notified Dettori of its decision, “the medical
committee has temporarily suspended the said jockey from riding
in races in France, based on medical grounds,” France Galop was
cited as saying in a statement today.  The medical committee’s report will be studied by France
Galop stewards within the next two weeks and they will decide
what action to take.  The banned substance hasn’t been publicly specified.
Dettori’s lawyer Christopher Stewart-Moore said last week it was
“not a performance-enhancing drug.”  Italian Dettori is a three-time champion jockey in Britain.
Last month he lost his role as a contracted jockey for Dubai
ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum’s Godolphin training
set-up. He was with the stable for 18 years and rode nine
English classic winners for it before falling out of favor this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
