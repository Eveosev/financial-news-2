U.K. government bonds were little
changed after minutes showed Bank of England policy makers voted
8-1 to stop expanding the central bank’s bond-purchase program
at a meeting earlier this month.  The yield on 10-year securities was at 1.85 percent as of
9:37 a.m. London time.  The pound strengthened 0.2 percent to 80.29 pence per euro
and was little changed at $1.5927.  A separate report showed Britain’s budget deficit widened
in October.  To contact the reporter on this story:
