Norway’s  unemployment  unexpectedly
fell in the September quarter as a boom in the country’s oil and
gas sector soaked up available labor.  The seasonally-adjusted jobless rate fell to 3 percent in
the August to October period from 3.1 percent,  Statistics Norway 
said today. The median estimate of eight economists in a
Bloomberg survey was for a rate of 3.1 percent.  Central bank Deputy Governor Jan F. Qvigstad said last week
that the economy has been “overheated” for the past six months
as low  interest rates  fuel a credit-driven housing boom. The
bank, which has held its benchmark rate at 1.5 percent since
March, has signaled it may begin to tighten monetary policy
between March and August next year.  Europe ’s second-largest oil and gas exporter has withstood
the euro area’s debt crisis as record petroleum investments feed
through to the rest of the economy. Boosted by  consumer
spending ,  gross domestic product , excluding oil, gas and
shipping, grew 0.7 percent in the third quarter, slowing from
0.8 percent in the prior quarter, a report yesterday showed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
