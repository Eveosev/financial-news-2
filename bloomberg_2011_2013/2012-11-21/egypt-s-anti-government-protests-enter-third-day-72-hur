At least 72 people were injured
during the third day of clashes between Egyptian police and
anti-government protesters in central Cairo.  The demonstrators, who had assembled to mark similar
rallies a year ago that left 45 dead, hurled stones and
firebombs and security forces fired bird-shot and tear gas.
Authorities arrested 118 protesters on charges of attacking the
police and destroying public facilities, the Ministry of
Interior said in an e-mailed statement today.  Activists and political groups have called for mass
protests across the country on Nov. 23 to demand the dismissal
of the President Mohamed Mursi’s government. The calls come in
the wake of this week’s fatal train and bus collision in Assiut
that left 51 dead, most of them children.  The violence underlined the task facing Mursi, the
country’s first popularly elected leader, who is struggling to
restore order and reinvigorate the economy even as near-daily
protests break out over issues ranging from the violence in Gaza
to jobs and surging crime.  Earlier today, protesters beat up Cairo security chief
Osama El-Sagheer and destroyed  Al Jazeera ’s office in the
Egyptian capital.  To contact the reporter on this story:
