Turkey ’s Federation of Consumer
Organizations signaled concern about surging bad consumer loans
and called on the country’s banking regulator to take measures.  The number of people defaulting on consumer loans rose to
990,552 in September from 766,813 a year earlier, the Istanbul-
based non-profit organization said in an e-mailed statement
today, citing central bank data. Bad consumer loans rose 28
percent in November from a year ago, while total consumer loans
increased 17 percent to 188 billion liras ($104 billion).  “Lack of conflict resolution in the collection of bad
loans may result in an increase in foreclosures and cause
irreparable damages to the consumer very soon,” the federation
said. “The banking regulator should act on this as soon as
possible.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
