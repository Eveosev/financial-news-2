Paranapanema SA (PMAM3) , Brazil’s biggest
copper smelter, said it’s in an “advanced” stage of analysis
of four possible purchases of stakes in mining projects as the
company seeks better procurement terms.  Owning a share of mines will allow Paranapanema to buy
copper concentrate cheaper than on the international market,
where its gets about 75 percent, Chief Executive Officer Luiz Antonio Ferraz Jr. said today in a telephone interview. He
declining to give details of the deals.  “Small and medium mineral deposits aren’t targets of the
big miners, so there is a very big space for us to act together
with strategic partners,” he said from Santo Andre, Brazil.
“We have here four projects in quite an interesting stage.”  Paranapanema, based in Dias D’Avila,  Brazil , is cutting
costs, boosting production capacity and selling assets as it
seeks to reverse losses amid slower growth in Latin America’s
largest economy. The company, which is investing about 1 billion
reais ($477 million) until 2014,  posted  on Nov. 14 a third-
quarter net loss of 177 million reais, its fourth straight
quarterly loss.  Paranapanema expects to produce about 260,000 metric tons
of refined copper next year, 44 percent more than an estimated
180,000 tons this year, after suffering 74 days of stoppages in
2012, Ferraz said. The producer, which is seeking to boost
capacity to 320,000 tons as early as in 2015, sees copper-
product demand growing 7 percent to 8 percent in 2013, he said.  Paranapanema  gained  3.2 percent to 3.54 reais at the close
in Sao Paulo today. The stock advanced 20 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
