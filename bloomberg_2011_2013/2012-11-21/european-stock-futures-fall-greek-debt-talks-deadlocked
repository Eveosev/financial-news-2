European stocks advanced for a third
day, as gains by Veolia Environnement SA, SAP AG and carmakers,
as well as a decline in applications for U.S. jobless benefits
offset the failure of euro-region policy makers to reach a
decision on assisting debt-laden  Greece .  Veolia Environnement rose 1.3 percent after getting
approval for the sale of its U.S. waste-management business. SAP
AG climbed 2 percent. Fiat SpA climbed 1.6 percent.  Johnson
Matthey (JMAT)  Plc slumped 5.8 percent after it reported a drop in
first-half profit. Imagination Technologies Group Plc slipped
3.9 percent as it said that it will monitor mobile chip designer
CEVA Inc.’s counter bid for MIPS Technologies Inc.  The  Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP)  rose 0.2 percent to 270.11 at
the close of trading. The gauge has climbed 16 percent from its
low on June 4, boosted by stimulus announcements from the
European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve as well as
better-than-forecast economic data.  “The European markets are very keen on at least a small
solution for Greece which is enough today to keep the market
alive and the U.S. data is not that bad,” said  Robert Halver ,
head of capital markets research at Baader Bank AG in  Frankfurt .
“This is enough for the markets today and may be the beginning
of a year-end rally.”  The volume of shares changing hands on the Stoxx 600 was 15
percent lower than the average of the last 30 days, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Options Slide  The  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which tracks the cost of Euro Stoxx 50
Index options, fell 4.9 percent to 17.85, its lowest level since
December 2007.  More than 11 hours of talks broke up early today in
Brussels with praise for the Greek government’s economic
overhaul and a declaration that a financing accord will wait at
least until a meeting of the ministers on Nov. 26.  With creditors led by  Germany  refusing to put up fresh
money or offer debt relief, the finance chiefs were unable to
scrape together enough funds from other sources to help
alleviate Greece’s debt burden, set to hit 190 percent of gross
domestic product in 2014.  In the U.S., Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said
yesterday an agreement on ways to reduce long-term  federal
budget  deficits would remove an impediment to growth, while
failure to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff would pose a
“substantial threat” to the recovery.  U.S. Jobless  Fewer Americans filed applications for unemployment
benefits last week as damage to the labor market caused by
superstorm Sandy began to subside.  Jobless claims  decreased by 41,000 to 410,000 in the week
ended Nov. 17, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . The number of applications matched the median
forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The index of U.S. leading economic indicators rose at a
slower pace in October as businesses held back on  investment  in
anticipation of domestic fiscal policy changes set to take
effect in January.  The  Conference Board ’s gauge of the outlook for the next
three to six months increased 0.2 percent after a revised 0.5
percent gain in September that was lower than initially
reported, the New York-based group said today. Economists
projected the October gauge would climb 0.1 percent, according
to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
U.S.  consumer sentiment  for November rose to 82.7 from 82.6 at
the end of last month. Economists projected 84.5 for the gauge
after a preliminary November reading of 84.9, according to the
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  Veolia Environnement  Veolia Environnement (VIE)  advanced 1.3 percent to 7.90 euros.
The world’s largest water company said it obtained approval from
the Department of Justice for the sale of its U.S. waste-
management business for $1.91 billion, which will cut its debt
by $1.84 billion.  SAP, the largest maker of enterprise-management software,
added 2 percent to 58.82 euros, its highest price since Sept. 5,
as Salesforce.com Inc. reported third quarter earnings per share
in line with analysts’ estimates and raised forecasts for 2013
and 2014.  BG Group Plc, the U.K.’s third-largest natural gas
provider, rose 2.8 percent to 1,060 pence amid takeover
speculation reported in The Independent newspaper.  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  gained 6.1 percent to 124.20 Swiss
francs. Switzerland’s biggest life insurer may write down almost
half the value of its German broker unit AWD Holding AG, an
analyst survey showed.  New Targets  Swiss Life, which plans to present new targets at an
investor day on Nov. 28, may write down about 463 million francs
($491 million), according to the average estimate of five
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The insurer valued the unit at
1.3 billion francs at the end of June. Christian Pfister, a
spokesman at Swiss Life in Zurich, declined to comment.  Royal KPN NV (KPN) , the former Dutch phone monopoly, added 6.8
percent to 4.26 euros. Moody’s Investors Service Inc. said
European cable operators’ revenues will grow by between 5
percent and 6 percent in 2013.  Fiat (F) , the Italian carmaker which controls Chrysler Group
LLC, rose 1.6 percent to 3.37 euros.  Renault SA (RNO) ,  France ’s
second-biggest automaker, gained 3.5 percent to 37.15 euros. A
gauge of carmakers made the second-biggest contribution to the
Stoxx 600’s advance.  Johnson Matthey  Johnson Matthey, which makes a third of all auto-catalysts,
tumbled 5.8 percent to 2,190 pence, its lowest in almost four
months, after it reported a 2.2 percent drop in first-half
profit as platinum prices slid, and forecast “similar” results
in the second six months of its fiscal year.  Net income was 145.7 million pounds ($232 million) in the
six months ended Sept. 30, compared with 149 million pounds a
year earlier, the London-based company said today.  Imagination Technologies (IMG)  slipped 3.9 percent to 423.8
pence, its lowest level in almost a year. The U.K. chip designer
in which Apple Inc. holds a minority stake said it will monitor
the situation after MIPS said it got an unsolicited $75 million-
proposal from CEVA to acquire its outstanding shares. MIPS had
recommended a $60 million-bid from Imagination for the shares.  Siemens AG fell 1.3 percent to 77.60 euros after Deutsche
Bank AG cut its rating on  Europe ’s largest engineering company
to sell from hold, and reduced its price target on the shares to
65 euros from 75 euros, citing threats to its 2014 margin
target, including low growth prospects.  Paragon Group Cos (PAG) , the lender to British landlords, lost 1
percent to 238.3 pence after RBC Capital Markets downgraded the
stock to sector perform from outperform. A 12-month target price
of 260 pence per share was forecast for the stock. The company
fell the most in nine weeks yesterday after analysts said its
plan to increase dividends is too modest.  A gauge of resource companies was the second-worst
performer of the  19 industry groups in the Stoxx 600 . Lonmin
Plc, the third-largest platinum producer, retreated 6 percent to
292.1 pence. Rio Tinto Group, the world’s third-largest mining
company, fell 1 percent to 2,997 pence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
