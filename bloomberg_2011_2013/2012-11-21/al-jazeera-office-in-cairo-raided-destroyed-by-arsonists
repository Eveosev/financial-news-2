Arsonists attacked and threw Molotov
cocktails at Al Jazeera Mubashir Misr channel’s office in the
Egyptian capital on the third day of anti-government protests in
central Cairo.  The office overlooking  Tahrir Square , the scene of three
days of protests, caught fire and was destroyed, footage
broadcast by the Cairo-based channel showed. Earlier today,
protesters beat up Cairo security chief Osama El-Sagheer as
police clashed with hundreds of protesters at the square.  Police used tear gas to repel the demonstrators, who
assembled to mark similar rallies a year ago in which 45 people
were killed. At least 72 people have been injured in the past
three days, the state-run Ahram Gate website reported.  The violence underlined the task facing President Mohamed Mursi, the country’s first popularly elected leader, who is
struggling to restore order and reinvigorate the economy even as
near-daily protests break out over issues ranging from the
violence in Gaza to jobs and surging crime.  Activists and political groups have called for mass
protests across  Egypt  on Nov. 23 to demand the dismissal of
Mursi’s government, according to Ahram Gate. The calls come in
the wake of a Nov. 17 train and bus collision in Assiut that
left 51 people dead, most of them children.  To contact the reporter on this story:
