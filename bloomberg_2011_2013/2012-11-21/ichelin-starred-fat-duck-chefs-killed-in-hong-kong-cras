Two chefs working for  Heston Blumenthal ’s Michelin three-star restaurant, The Fat Duck, were killed in a car crash in Hong Kong, the city’s police said.  Carl Magnus Lindgren, 30, and Jorge Herrera, 34, died after the taxi they were traveling in was crushed between two double- decker buses on Nov. 19, said Florence Lui, assistant information officer at the Police Public Relations Branch.  The driver of one of the two buses lost consciousness before the crash, Lui said. The 53-year-old driver of the taxi, Wong Kim-chung, died in the incident, which occurred at 11:38 a.m., she said.  Two senior members of Blumenthal’s culinary team were staying at the Mandarin Oriental in  Hong Kong  on business, Nina Coll, the hotel’s director of communications, said in an e-mail, declining to identify the guests.  Blumenthal was shown in a video on the website of the  Oriental Daily  exiting the Victoria Public Mortuary yesterday morning, dressed in a black t-shirt.  The restaurateur opened  Fat Duck  in 1995 in a converted 450-year-old pub located in the village of Bray, Berkshire, in Britain, according to its  website .  The restaurant’s  tasting menu , which costs 195 pounds, features snail porridge, salmon poached in a licorice gel and wine gums, and requires roughly 3 1/2 hours to consume.  Muse highlights include  James Russell  on architecture.
