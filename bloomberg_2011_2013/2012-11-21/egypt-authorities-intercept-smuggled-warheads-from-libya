Egyptian authorities have
intercepted a weapons cache including over 100 Grad rocket
warheads smuggled in from  Libya , the  Interior Ministry  said in a
faxed statement.  Authorities intercepted two trucks near the north-western
city of Marsa Matrouh laden with almost 270 boxes containing 108
warheads, as well roughly 20,000 small-arms rounds, the
statement said.  Egyptian security forces have intercepted several arms
shipments smuggled in from Libya and reportedly destined for
Sinai, authorities said. In the past year these have included
surface-to-air missiles, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and
ammunition.  With assistance from Ahmed El-Sayed in Cairo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
