Morgan Stanley (MS)  was sued by DZ Bank
AG, a clearinghouse for cooperative banks in Germany, over
claims the investment bank misrepresented and omitted
information about $694 million in mortgage-backed securities.  DZ Bank, based in Frankfurt, filed the suit today in New
York State Supreme Court in Manhattan. It has taken similar
actions in the same court against other banks this year,
including  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , HSBC Holdings Plc, UBS AG and
 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)   Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  Morgan Stanley’s media office didn’t immediately return an
e-mail seeking comment on the lawsuit.  DZ Bank is one of two clearing organizations for Germany’s
cooperative banks, allowing it to provide structured products
directly to more than 900 local lenders.  The case is Deutsche Zentral Genossenschaftsbank AG v.
Morgan Stanley, 654035/2012,  New York  State Supreme Court, New
York County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
