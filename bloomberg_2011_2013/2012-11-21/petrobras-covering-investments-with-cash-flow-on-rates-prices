Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
state-controlled oil company, is generating enough cash flow to
cover investments with current oil prices and the local  exchange
rate , and doesn’t have a time frame for an increase in domestic
fuel prices.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based producer is known,
won’t need a fuel price increase if international crude prices
fall like they did in 2009, Chief Executive Officer Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters in Brasilia today. She said the
company expects to increse fuel prices eventually.  “Lets assume that Brent falls, like it did in 2009, we
won’t have a fuel price increase,” Foster said. “What I’m
making absolutely clear is that today there is a perfect harmony
between Petrobras’s healthy  cash flow  and its capacity to
invest.”  Petrobras’s refining division posted a record 17.3 billion
reais ($8.3 billion) in losses during the first nine months of
this year, mainly because it sells imported gasoline and diesel
below cost as part of the government’s efforts to control
inflation. The government controls Petrobras’s board with a
majority of voting shares.  Petrobras fell 2.7 percent to 18.62 reais in Sao Paulo, the
lowest in four months. The stock is down 13 percent this year,
compared with a 0.9 percent drop in the benchmark  stock index .
Brent for January settlement advanced 88 cents, or 0.8 percent,
to $110.71 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange in
 London .  To contact the reporter on this story:
