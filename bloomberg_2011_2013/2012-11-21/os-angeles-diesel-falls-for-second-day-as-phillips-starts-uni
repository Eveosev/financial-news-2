Spot diesel in  Los Angeles 
strengthened for a second day as Phillips 66 was said to be
starting a hydrocracker at its Los Angeles-area refinery after
finishing planned maintenance.  The 139,000-barrel-a-day plant will take about a week to
return the unit to normal operations, a person familiar with the
work said today. The hydrocracker was scheduled to be shut about
Oct. 16 for a turnaround, two people with knowledge of the plans
said last month.  California-grade, or CARB, diesel in Los Angeles fell 0.75
cent to a 3.25-cent-a-gallon premium over heating oil futures
traded on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange at 1:36 p.m. Eastern
time, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The same fuel in
 San Francisco  declined 4.5 cents to a discount of 2 cents.  California-blend gasoline, or Carbob, in Los Angeles
climbed 2.5 cents to a premium of 12.5 cents a gallon over
gasoline futures traded on the Nymex. Carbob in San Francisco
fell 3 cents to a 3-cent discount.  Conventional 84 sub-octane gasoline to be blended with
ethanol in  Portland ,  Oregon , dropped 1 cent to a discount of 20
cents a gallon to gasoline futures. Low-sulfur diesel in
Portland was unchanged at 6.5 cents over heating oil futures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
