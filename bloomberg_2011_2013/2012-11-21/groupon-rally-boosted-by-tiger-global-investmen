Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , the largest provider
of daily deals, rose 15 percent, climbing for the second day
after Tiger Global Management LLC said it acquired a 9.9 percent
stake in the coupon website.  The shares advanced to $3.88 at the close in  New York ,
their biggest gain since May. The stock has gained for the sixth
straight day, making it a 48 percent jump over the period.  Groupon is still 81 percent below its November 2011 initial
public offering, when the shares sold for $20 each. The backing
of Tiger Global, a New York hedge fund run by Chase Coleman and
Feroz Dewan, is one of the first encouraging signs for the
Chicago-based company amid a tumultuous year, said Edward Woo,
analyst at Ascendiant Capital Markets LLC in Irvine,  California .  “Now that we have a really smart investor taking a really
big stake in the company, investors may be saying it’s worth
jumping in now,” said Woo, who recommends selling the shares.  Groupon took steps to bolster its international sales,
which fell during the most recent quarter, including promoting
e-commerce veteran Kal Raman to chief operating officer last
week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
