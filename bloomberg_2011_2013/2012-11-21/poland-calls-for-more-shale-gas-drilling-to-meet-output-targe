Poland must increase shale gas
exploration to reach its goal to boost domestic natural gas
output to more than 10 billion cubic meters by 2020, Treasury
Minister Mikolaj Budzanowski said.  The eastern European country, which imports about two-
thirds of its gas from  Russia ’s OAO Gazprom, wants to double its
production of the fuel from about 4.5 billion cubic meters per
year by 2019 to improve its negotiating position before talks
start on a new long-term contract that ends in 2022.  “Achieving at least 10 billion cubic meters of domestic
output is our only chance to cut that dependency,” Budzanowski
told a conference today. “Ten-plus wells per year is way too
little to achieve that, we need to drill several times more.”  Poland will have 34 exploration wells completed this year
instead of 45 expected earlier as some projects are delayed,
Deputy Environment Minister Piotr Wozniak said in September. The
country granted over 100 licenses to explore for the fuel.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the reporter on this story:
