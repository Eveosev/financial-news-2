Belgium ’s Apetra, the agency that
manages the nation’s strategic oil stockpiles, bought 55,000
cubic meters of diesel in a tender, covering its needs for the
rest of the year, an official said.  The tender for about 46,000 metric tons for delivery from
November to December was awarded last month, Alain de Mot,
Apetra’s general manager, said by phone today from Brussels. He
declined to disclose the price or seller.  The next tender to purchase products hasn’t been finalized
and will be for deliveries next year, he said.  The agency bought 20,000 tons of diesel for last month and
another 68,000 cubic meters for September and October in
separate tenders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
