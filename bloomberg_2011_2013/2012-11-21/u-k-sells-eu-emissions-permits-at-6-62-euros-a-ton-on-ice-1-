The U.K. sold 6.5 million European
Union carbon permits for immediate delivery at 6.62 euros
($8.46) a metric ton on ICE Futures  Europe , according to the
exchange’s  website .  The clearing price in the auction was 2 cents lower than
the prevailing  spot price  on the Paris-based Bluenext SA
exchange at 11 a.m. local time. EU permits for December reversed
earlier losses to advance 0.3 percent to 6.76 euros a ton as of
10:25 a.m. in London.  Bids in the sale totaled 18.5 million tons of allowances,
or 2.8 times the amount for sale, according to ICE data compiled
by Bloomberg. A sale of 4.5 million permits by the EU yesterday
received 2.7 times more bids than the volume available.  The EU will sell more than half of all carbon permits
during the third phase of the bloc’s market, which runs from
2013 through 2020, after it gave away almost all allowances in
the second phase of the emissions-trading system from 2008
through 2012.  The U.K. is selling a total of 12.3 million permits for
2013 in two sales before the end of the year, as part of a 120
million ton program of so-called early Phase 3 sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
