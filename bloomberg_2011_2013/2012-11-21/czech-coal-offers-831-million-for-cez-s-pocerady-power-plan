Czech Coal AS offered 16.5 billion
koruna ($831 million) for  CEZ AS (CEZ) ’s 1,000-megawatt Pocerady coal-
fired power plant as it seeks to expand into electricity
production.  The actual amount paid will depend on whether carbon
credits are included in the sale, Czech Coal spokeswoman
Gabriela Benesova said in a telephone interview today from
 Prague . The deadline for CEZ’s decision is the end of the year.  “Our offer is very attractive,” Benesova said. “It
includes several alternatives depending on what kind of package
CEZ offers.”  Czech Coal, which is competing for the plant with utility
Energeticky a Prumyslovy Holding AS, also wants Pocerady because
it is located next to its Vrsany coal mine in the north west of
the  Czech Republic . CEZ and Czech Coal are in dispute over the
price of coal the miner supplies to the utility. The long-term
contracts for coal supply to Pocerady expire at the year end and
CEZ claims the price Czech Coal is asking to renew the contract
is too high.  “Czech Coal has warned it will stop supplying Pocerady
after the current contracts run out at the end of the year,”
Bohumil Trampota, an analyst at J&T Banka AS in Prague, wrote
today in a note. “If CEZ decides not to sell Pocerady, it will
have to ramp up production in its own coal mines in Northern
Bohemia and transport the coal to the plant.”  CEZ shares were down 1 percent to 671.7 koruna at 12:41
p.m. in Prague. The stock has lost 14.5 percent of its value
this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
