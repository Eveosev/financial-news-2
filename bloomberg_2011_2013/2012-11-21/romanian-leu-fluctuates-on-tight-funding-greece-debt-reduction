Romania ’s leu gained for the first
time in three days as an extension of a cap on repo funding to a
seventh week offset paring of risk appetite after European
officials failed to agree on a debt-reduction package for
 Greece .  The leu strengthened 0.1 percent to 4.5306 by 6 p.m. in
Bucharest, heading for its highest level in more than a week.
Yields on 2019 Eurobonds were unchanged at 4.901 percent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The Banca Nationala a Romania extended its 6 billion lei
($1.7 billion) limit on funding via repurchase agreements even
as demand rose to 30 billion lei at an auction on Nov. 19,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The central bank
introduced the cap on Oct. 8. European finance ministers failed
to agree on a debt-reduction package for Greece after battling
with the  International Monetary Fund  over how to bring the
recession-wrecked country back to fiscal health.  “European finance ministers failed to overcome division
over how fast to cut Athens’ debt and called a further meeting
next week,” Mihai Patrulescu, a Bucharest-based economist at
UniCredit Tiriac Bank SA wrote in a note today.  A campaign for general elections in Romania started on Nov.
9 as the ruling coalition of Prime Minister Victor Ponta goes
head-to-head with the opposition party supporting president
Traian Basescu. Parliamentary elections will be held on Dec. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
