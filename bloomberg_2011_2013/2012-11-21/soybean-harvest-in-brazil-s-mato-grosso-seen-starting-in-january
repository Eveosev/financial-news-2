Soybean harvesting in the Brazilian
state of Mato Grosso, the country’s biggest grower of the
oilseed, may start in January’s first half based on planting
progress to date, said Soybean & Corn Advisor Inc.  The harvest should start about Jan. 5-10 in the
municipality of Lucas do Rio Verde in central Mato Grosso, the
Hinsdale, Illinois-based researcher said in an online  report 
today. Dry weather delayed planting in Sinop in the state’s
north, meaning gathering there will start about Jan. 15-20, the
company said.  Brazil  is predicted to overtake the U.S., where crop yields
in the Midwest were hurt by a summer drought, as the biggest
soybean exporter in the 2012-13 season, the U.S. Department of
Agriculture forecasts. The start of soybean shipments from South
America next year is expected to ease supply conditions,
according to researcher Oil World.  “There might be a few fields of soybeans in Mato Grosso
harvested by New Year’s Day, but the volume of harvested
soybeans will be small until about the middle of January,”
Soybean & Corn Advisor wrote.  Farmers can manage the harvest’s timing because many early
soybeans are forced into maturity by use of desiccants that
prompt leaves to drop off plants and stems to dry out, after
which the crop is ready for gathering in seven to 10 days,
according to the researcher.  To contact the reporter on this story:
