Polish year-ahead electricity
declined to its lowest level in more than four years amid
falling demand.  Electricity for delivery next year fell 0.3% to 175.40
zloty ($54.60) a megawatt-hour, broker data showed. That’s the
lowest price since Bloomberg started tracking data in June 2008.  Polish power use fell in October, extending a decline from
the first nine months as economic growth slowed, the country’s
transmission grid said yesterday.  Next-day power in  Poland  fell 1.6 percent to 182.70 zloty a
megawatt-hour, according to exchange data compiled by Bloomberg.
The country was set to send 820 megawatts of power to the  Czech
Republic ,  Germany  and Slovakia from 6 a.m. to 7 a.m. tomorrow,
down from 1,700 megawatts at the same time today, according to
the data from the grid manager.  Next-day electricity on the coupled markets of the Czech
Republic and Slovakia dropped 1 percent to 49.66 euros ($63.66)
a megawatt-hour in a daily auction, according to the countries’
market operators. The day-ahead contract in  Hungary  fell 3.8
percent to 49.91 euros a megawatt-hour.  To contact the reporter on this story:
