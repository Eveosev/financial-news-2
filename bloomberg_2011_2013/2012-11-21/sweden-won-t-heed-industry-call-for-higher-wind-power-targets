Sweden  will not respond to calls
from wind-power developers to boost targets for alternative
energy output, for fear of undermining investor confidence.  “I know it is not always easy to be a wind-power
entrepreneur, with low electricity certificate prices triggering
calls for political intervention,” Anna-Karin Hatt, Swedish
minister for information technology and energy, said today at a
conference in  Stockholm , according to an  e-mailed copy of her
speech .  The Swedish Wind Energy Association wants the government to
raise targets for renewable energy investments to secure higher
revenue for wind-power producers, the earnings of which are
affected by subdued prices for power and tradable electricity
certificate subsidies. That may cause the country to fall short
of official renewable energy goals, the association said on Oct.
23.  “I’m genuinely concerned that such unplanned and rash
changes would undermine the credibility of the system,” Hatt
said, ruling out more stringent targets which would secure
better viability for wind farms.  An EU directive from 2009 requires all member-states to
increase the proportion of renewable energy production in gross
final energy consumption so that the bloc reaches a total of 20
percent by 2020. The target for Sweden is 49 percent, compared
with a 39.8 percent share in 2005.  Tradable renewable energy certificates, a subsidy system
introduced in Sweden in 2003 and in  Norway  this year, are
designed to add a total of 26.4 terawatt-hours of annual power
output in the two countries from 2012 to 2020, mostly from wind
power, according to Sweden’s Energy Agency.  Recovery Ahead  The average price for renewable electricity certificates
over the past year has been 198.7 kroner ($29.4) per megawatt-
hour, according to data on grid operator  Svenska Kraftnaet’s
website .  The Nordic power contract for 2013 traded at 36.90 euros
($47.16) a megawatt-hour at 11:47 a.m. on the Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo.  Electricity certificates, which are traded bilaterally,
have risen “markedly since the summer, and have a significant
further upside”, Swedish power trading company  Telge Kraft AB 
said today in an e-mailed report. That’s helping wind-power
investors to attract financing, with a total of 100 billion
Swedish kronor ($14.8 billion) or 3 percent of Swedish GDP
needed for the period 2012 through 2020 to boost annual output
to as much as 20 terawatt-hours, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
