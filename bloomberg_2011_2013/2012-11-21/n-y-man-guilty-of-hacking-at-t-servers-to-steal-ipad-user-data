A  New York  man was convicted of
hacking into  AT&T Inc. (T) ’s servers, stealing the e-mail addresses
and personal information of about 120,000  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPad users,
and giving the information to a reporter at Gawker.  Andrew Auernheimer, 27, was found guilty today by a federal
jury in Newark, New Jersey, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said in a
statement. Auernheimer was convicted of conspiracy and
possession and transfer of the iPad users’ account information.
He faces as long as five years in prison for each of the two
counts, according to the statement.  Auernheimer and a co-defendant who pleaded guilty belonged
to Goatse Security, a “security research” group, prosecutors
said. They created an “iPad 3G Account Slurper” script and
deployed it against Dallas-based AT&T’s servers for several days
in June 2010, according to prosecutors.  The Account Slurper mimicked the behavior of an iPad to
deceive the servers into granting access, prosecutors said.
After stealing the user data, the hackers provided it to Gawker,
which published the information in redacted form along with an
article on the breach, the U.S. said.  Tor Ekeland, Auernheimer’s lawyer, said he will appeal the
verdict.  “This is a dangerously vague and broad interpretation of
what constitutes unauthorized access under the computer fraud
and abuse act,” Ekeland said in a telephone interview. “It
criminalizes normal behavior.”  The case is U.S. v. Auernheimer, 11-470, U.S. District
Court, District of  New Jersey  (Newark).  To contact the reporter on this story:
