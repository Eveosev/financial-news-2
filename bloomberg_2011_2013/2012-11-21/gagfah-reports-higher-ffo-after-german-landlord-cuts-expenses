Gagfah SA (GFJ) , the second-biggest owner
of German homes, said third-quarter funds from operations rose
37 percent after the company reduced its expenses.  FFO excluding disposals, a measure of a property company’s
ability to generate cash, climbed to 29.9 million euros ($38.1
million) from 21.8 million euros a year earlier, the Luxembourg-
based company controlled by  Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG)  said
in a statement today. Net interest expenses fell to 63.3 million
euros from 93.2 million a year earlier.  Gagfah is selling its 38,000 apartments in Dresden to help
pay 3.1 billion euros of debt due next year. Fortress is among
the private-equity firms facing debt deadlines after buying
German properties with the cheap credit available in the years
before the global financial crisis started in 2008.  “Refinancing will remain an important driver for our share
price, and we are on track towards resolving our 2013 debt
maturities,” Gagfah Chief Executive Officer Stephen Charlton
said in the statement.  Gagfah shares have more than doubled in Frankfurt trading
this year, the  second-best performing stock  on the German DAX
Mid-Cap Index for medium-sized companies, which has gained 26
percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
