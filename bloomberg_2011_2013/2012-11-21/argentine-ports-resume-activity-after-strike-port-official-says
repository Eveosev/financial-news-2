Argentine port workers returned to
normal activities today after a 24-hour strike that delayed
shipments, said Guillermo Wade, an official at the port
exporters chamber.  All Parana River ports are operating again and ships are
loading grain normally, Wade said by telephone from Rosario, the
country’s largest soybean export port.  Argentine trade unions blocked highways and halted train,
bus and subway services yesterday in their first general strike
against President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  to protest
rising prices and taxes. Immigration, customs, health as well as
port administration employees went on strike yesterday, Wade
said.  “Activity is normal,” he said. “Trucks loaded with
grains are coming to Rosario’s main ports.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
