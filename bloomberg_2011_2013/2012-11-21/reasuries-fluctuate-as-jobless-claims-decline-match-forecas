Treasuries fell, pushing 10-year
yields higher for a third day, as optimism that European finance
ministers are close to a debt-reduction package for Greece
damped demand for refuge.  Ten-year yields  rose  to an almost two-week high as the U.S.
sold $13 billion in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities of
the same maturity at a higher-than-forecast yield of negative
0.72 percent.  U.S. government debt  due in 10 years and longer
has returned 2.2 percent in the past month, the most among
securities in 144 indexes tracked by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Volatility dropped
yesterday to a five-year low.  “We’re being driven by what’s going on in  Europe ,” said
Jason Rogan, director of U.S. government trading at Guggenheim
Partners LLC, a New York-based brokerage for institutional
investors. “At least people are meeting to come up with a plan.
It’s showing initiative.”  The benchmark  10-year yield  rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 4:59 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 1.625 percent
security due in November 2022 dropped 1/8, or $1.25 per $1,000
face amount, to 99 1/2. The yield touched 1.69 percent, the
highest since Nov. 8.  The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association
recommends a full market  close  tomorrow for the Thanksgiving Day
holiday and an early close at 2 p.m.  New York  time on Nov. 23.  Volatility Plunges  “People are hopeful that something resolves itself around
Greece,” said Tom Tucci, managing director and head of Treasury
trading in New York at CIBC World Markets Corp. “I’m not sure
if that’s going to happen. It’s a short lived sell-off because
of austerity -- they will continue to have weak economic
growth.”  Volatility in U.S. government bonds dropped to the lowest
in more than five years before the holiday. Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s  MOVE index , which measures price swings for
Treasuries based on options, fell to 53.7 yesterday, the least
since May 2007.  Treasury trading  volume  rose to $241.6 billion yesterday,
compared with the 2012 daily average of $241 billion, according
to ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of U.S. government
debt. The figure was up from $177 billion the previous day.  Jobless claims decreased by 41,000 to 410,000 in the week
ended Nov. 17 as damage to the labor market caused by  Hurricane
Sandy  began to subside, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . The number of applications matched the median
forecast of 48 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  Economic Reading  “You can’t make much of the two-week’s worth of economic
data because it’s highly impacted by Hurricane Sandy,” said  Tom Porcelli , chief U.S. economist in New York at Royal Bank of
Canada, one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal
Reserve . “You are going to be hard pressed to find a catalyst
today, unless you get some significant out-of-consensus print on
the economic data.”  The Fed sold $7.67 billion in Treasuries maturing from
November 2015 to January 2016 today as part of its Operation
Twist program in which it swaps short-term debt for longer-term
securities.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said yesterday an agreement to
reduce long-term U.S. deficits may remove an impediment to
economic growth and crimp haven demand. The Fed’s next policy
meeting is Dec. 11-12.  TIPS Trade  Ten-year TIPS  yielded  negative 0.764 percent just before
today’s auction. The rate slid to a record negative 0.96 percent
last month, with investors so concerned about inflation that
they are willing to accept yields below zero to buy debt that
protects against price gains.  Demand today was stronger than at the last auction, drawing
a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.52, compared with 2.36 at the previous
sale in September, the lowest since 2009.  Indirect bidders, a group that includes foreign central
banks, bought 48.3 percent of the amount sold, compared with
43.8 percent in the prior auction. Primary dealers bought 41.3
percent, compared with 48.5 in the previous sale. Direct bidders
purchased 10.4 percent, compared with 7.7 percent at the
previous sale.  Treasuries were earlier supported as 27 European Union
leaders are preparing to square off over the budget in Brussels
tomorrow after euro-region finance ministers’ efforts to agree
on a debt-reduction plan for  Greece  failed. More than 11 hours
of talks ended without a deal early this morning as a bloc of
top-rated creditors led by  Germany  refused to write off a
portion of their aid loans. The finance ministers will regroup
on Nov. 26.  To contact the reporter on this story:
