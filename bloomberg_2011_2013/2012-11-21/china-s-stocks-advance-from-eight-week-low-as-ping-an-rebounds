Most Chinese  stocks  fell, as
declines by consumer-staple producers overshadowed gains among
financial and energy companies.  Wuliangye Yibin Co. (000858)  sank 2.7 percent, pacing declines among
liquor makers. Ping An Insurance (Group) Co., the nation’s
second-biggest insurer, gained 1.2 percent, snapping four days
of losses，amid speculation HSBC Holdings Plc will sell its
stake in the company.  Three stocks dropped for every one that advanced in the
 Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which slid 0.3 percent to 2,003.30 as
of 11:07 a.m. local time. It climbed 0.7 percent earlier. The
 CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  fell 0.2 percent to 2,161.28. The Shanghai gauge
closed at its lowest level since Sept. 26 yesterday after data
showed foreign direct investment in China dropped last month.
Conference Board reported today that its Chinese leading
economic index gained 1.5 percent in October.  “The market rose a bit at the start before paring gains
again, showing the lack of confidence,” Zhou Lin, an analyst at
Huatai Securities Co., said by phone from Nanjing. “There isn’t
enough volume to push stocks any higher and investors are unsure
the economy has reached a bottom. For the rest of the year, I
don’t see any impetus for shares to climb substantially.”  The last time the Shanghai Composite closed below 2,000 was
in January 2009. The gauge’s trading volumes were 38 percent
below the 30-day average for this time of day, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Volumes on the city’s bourse slumped
yesterday to the lowest level since Dec. 12, 2011, the data
show.  The  Hang Seng China Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies
traded in  Hong Kong  climbed 0.7 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US
55 Index (CH55BN) , the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese
companies, dropped 1.1 percent in  New York .  Share Sales  A gauge of consumer staples in the CSI 300 fell 0.9
percent, the biggest drop among 10 industry groups. The measure
is down 21 percent from its July 13 peak.  Sichuan Swellfun Co. slumped 4.4 percent while Wuliangye
Yibin dropped 2.7 percent. Jiuguijiu Co. shares remained halted
trading after the company said it would check an unidentified
media report that its liquor contains excessive amounts of
plasticizer, a chemical.  “Reports about plasticizer in Jiuguijiu are very negative
to liquor makers,” said Wang Ping, analyst at Great Wall
Securities Co. The  Securities Times  reported an unidentified
company official denying the possibility of plasticizer in
liquor products. Three calls to the company’s board office by
Bloomberg before business hours were not answered.  IPO Concerns  The Shanghai Composite had lost 2.3 percent since Nov. 14
through yesterday amid concern a new generation of leaders named
by China’s ruling party will fail to accelerate economic
reforms. The gauge has fallen 8.4 percent this year.  China’s securities regulator will conduct its first review
of a share-sale application in more than a month today.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission will today
decide on Zhuhai Port Co.’s plan to place shares, the regulator
said in a statement dated Nov. 16. Zhuhai Port said in December
2011 that it planned to raise 561 million  yuan  ($90 million) to
finance an acquisition. Zhuzhou Times New Material Technology
Co.’s share placement plan was the last to be reviewed and
approved on Oct. 12, according to the CSRC’s website.  More than 800 companies have applied and are awaiting
approval to sell shares in China, the 21st Century Business
Herald reported on Nov. 14. Of these, more than 700 are initial
public offerings, according to the newspaper.  Two phone calls today to the press office of the CSRC
seeking comment went unanswered.  Policy Direction  The Shanghai Composite trades at 9.6 times estimated profit
for 2012, compared with the 17.8 average multiple since
Bloomberg began compiling the weekly  data  in 2006. Thirty-day
 volatility  on the index was at 12.5, compared with this year’s
average of 17.1.  Ping An rose 1.2 percent to 35.74 yuan. HSBC is in talks to
sell shares of Ping An to  Thailand ’s Charoen Pokphand Group for
about HK$74 billion ($9.6 billion), the Shanghai Securities News
reported. HSBC contacted  China  Investment Corp. about the sale
of its stake in Ping An，the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing people familiar.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., slid 1 percent, the biggest
drop in a week, to $36.19.  -- Editors: Darren Boey, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter for this story:
