Poste Italiane  won European Union
approval for about 1.56 billion euros ($2 billion) in Italian
government subsidies for operating postal services from 2009 to
2011.  The European Commission approved the payments of 1.1
billion euros for providing public service postal deliveries and
458 million euros to compensate for reduced postal fees for
publishers, non-profit organizations and political candidates.  The commission said in an e-mailed statement it initially
treated the payments as illegal state aid because  Italy  hadnâ€™t
informed regulators of them in advance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
