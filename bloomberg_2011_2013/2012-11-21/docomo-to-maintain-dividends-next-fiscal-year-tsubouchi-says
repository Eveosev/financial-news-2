NTT DoCoMo Inc. (9437) , Japan’s largest
mobile-phone company, plans to maintain dividends next fiscal
year to lure investors as it lags behind competitors in adding
subscribers.  “We will at least maintain  dividends ,” even as operating
profit may not increase next fiscal year, Chief Financial
Officer Kazuto Tsubouchi said in an interview in  Tokyo 
yesterday. “Keeping the payouts is a high priority.”  The company, which lagged behind  KDDI Corp. (9433)  and  Softbank
Corp. (9984)  in the number of subscribers added in October, cut its
 profit forecast  last month to boost sales promotion spending.
Starting this month, DoCoMo plans to introduce 11 new handsets
that work on a faster network using Long Term Evolution
technology in a bid to win back market share after its rivals
began offering Apple Inc.’s iPhone 5 in September.  “Investors had fears that DoCoMo would cut its dividends
next fiscal year because of an expected profit decline,” said
Shinji Moriyuki, a Tokyo-based analyst at SMBC Nikko Securities
Inc. in Tokyo. The CFO’s comments “are good enough” to ease
such concern, he said.  DoCoMo rose 1.7 percent, the most since Oct. 16, to 118,100
yen at the close on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, paring this year’s
decline to 17 percent. KDDI has gained 23 percent in the period
and Softbank has advanced 38 percent.  The carrier, 63 percent  owned  by  Nippon Telegraph &
Telephone Corp. (9432) ,  expects  operating profit of 820 billion yen
($9.9 billion) for the 12 months ending March, 8.9 percent less
than its previous estimate of 900 billion yen, the company said
last month. That would be 6.2 percent lower than last fiscal
year. Annual revenue may be 4.52 trillion yen, an increase from
the 4.45 trillion yen forecast in July, DoCoMo said.  ‘Ample Cash’  “We have ample  cash , so we can pay our shareholders,”
Tsubouchi said. The company, which hasn’t reduced dividends
since it sold shares in 1998, plans to pay 6,000 yen a share
this fiscal year, it said in October.  It may take two years for the company to be able to post
900 billion yen in operating profit, President Kaoru Kato told
reporters Oct. 26.  Net income may increase 9.3 percent from a year earlier to
507 billion yen in the 12 months ending March 31, the Tokyo-
based company said, lowering its previous forecast of 557
billion yen.  DoCoMo’s share of mobile-phone subscribers in  Japan  fell to
46.2 percent as of Oct. 31 from 50.3 percent three years
earlier, according to data compiled by Bloomberg using company
announcements. DoCoMo had a net gain of 7,200 subscribers last
month, compared with gains of 238,800 at KDDI and 284,200 at
Softbank.  DoCoMo forecasts subscriber additions will total 2 million
this fiscal year, down from an earlier estimate of 2.8 million,
it said last month. Additional promotional expenses for the year
will probably total 80 billion yen, DoCoMo said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
