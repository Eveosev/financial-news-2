Money sent back home to  developing
countries  by migrant workers and overseas wage-earners such as
domestic maids employed outside their own countries will
increase 6.5 percent to $406 billion in 2012, the World Bank
said in an estimate released today.  India  is expected to receive the largest sum of officially
recorded remittances, $70 billion, followed by  China  at $66
billion and the Philippines and Mexico, which are forecast to
get $24 billion each, the World Bank said. As a portion of the
economy, Tajikistan was the largest recipient last year, getting
money worth 47 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product,
the Washington-based lender said in an e-mailed release.  Transfers are projected to keep growing even as handling
costs averaged 9 percent in countries with available data and
high unemployment in  Europe  combined with “hardening”
attitudes toward migrant workers in some places, according to
the bank.  “Migrant workers are displaying tremendous resilience in
the face of the continuing economic crisis in advanced
countries,” Dilip Ratha, manager of the  World Bank ’s migration
and remittances unit, said in the release. “Their agility in
finding alternate employment and cutting down on personal
expenses has prevented large scale return to their home
countries.”  “Remittances to developing countries are projected to grow
by 7.9 percent in 2013, 10.1 percent in 2014 and 10.7 percent in
2015 to reach $534 billion in 2015,” the World Bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
