The U.K. should focus research into
new agricultural technologies such as crop-breeding programs on
spurring productivity and meeting higher food demand in coming
decades, the National Farmers Union said.  The government, industry groups and researchers should take
a “united approach” to increasing  food production  by 50
percent in the first half of this century, the Stoneleigh,
England-based NFU said in an e-mailed statement today. It cited
a study led by Chris Pollock, a professor at Aberystwyth
University in  Wales , that was commissioned by the NFU along with
other industry groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
