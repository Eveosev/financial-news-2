Co. is increasing production of
refined products, CEO Maria das Gracas Foster told reporters in
Brasilia.
* Co. has a comfortable cash position and will meet its
investment target for 2012
* Stock extended decline in  Sao Paulo , down 1.93 percent
* “Lets assume that Brent falls, like it did in 2009, we won’t
have a fuel price increase,” Foster said when asked about fuel
prices. “What I’m making absolutely clear is that today there
is a perfect harmony between Petrobras’s healthy cash flow and
its capacity to invest.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
