Taiwan ’s government bonds fell, with
benchmark 10-year yields rising to a one-week high, after a jump
in export orders spurred optimism the island’s economy is
starting to recover.  Orders for overseas sales advanced 3.2 percent in October
from a year earlier, more than the 0.2 percent increase forecast
in a Bloomberg survey, official data showed yesterday. Gross
domestic product probably rose 1 percent in the third quarter,
after declining 0.2 percent in the preceding three months,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey before a
report due Nov. 23.  “The economy has hit the bottom and is on its way to
recovery as exports pick up,” said Jackit Wong, a regional
economist at Natixis Asia Ltd. in Hong Kong.  The yield on the 1.125 percent notes due September 2022 was
1.121 percent, compared with 1.118 percent yesterday, according
to Gretai Securities Market. That’s the highest level since Nov.
12.  The U.S. government and lawmakers held a new round of
deficit-reduction negotiations this week in a bid to thwart
automatic tax increases and spending cuts that threaten to throw
the country into recession next year. Federal Reserve Chairman
Ben S. Bernanke said yesterday an agreement on reducing long-
term budget deficits will remove an impediment to growth in the
world’s biggest economy.  “Bernanke’s words boosted optimism about the economic
outlook,” said Albert Lee , a fixed-income trader at Cathay
United Bank Co. “This risk-on sentiment led to a rise in
yields.”  Taiwan’s dollar weakened 0.1 percent to NT$29.179 against
its U.S. counterpart, based on Taipei Forex Inc. prices. The
currency touched NT$28.959 on Nov. 12, the strongest level since
September 2011. One-month implied volatility dropped 20 basis
points, or 0.2 percentage point, to 3.6 percent.  The overnight  interbank lending rate  was little changed at
0.383 percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the
Taiwan Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporters on this story:
