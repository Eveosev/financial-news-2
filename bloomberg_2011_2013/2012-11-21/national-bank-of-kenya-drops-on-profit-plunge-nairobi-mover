National Bank of Kenya Ltd.  fell to
the lowest level in five weeks after the state-owned lender said
profit plunged 67 percent.  The shares retreated 0.3 percent to 18.25 shillings by the
close in the capital, Nairobi, the lowest level since Oct. 16.
About 9,500 shares traded, or 37 percent of the three-month
daily average.  Profit slumped to 397 million shillings ($5 million) in the
nine months through September from 1.23 billion shillings a year
earlier, the lender said yesterday. Interest expenses surged to
2.9 billion shillings from 766.4 million shillings, it said.  “It’s declining basically because of the earnings,” Faith Atiti, an analyst at Nairobi-based  NIC Securities Ltd. (NICB) , said by
telephone today. “Their interest expenses grew almost four
times, operating expenses were not controlled because they
increased 26 percent and their loan loss provision is higher
than most banks.”  National Bank has declined 10 percent this year,making it
the worst-performing lender in the  Nairobi Securities Exchange
All-share Index. (NSEASI)  The gauge has rallied 36 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
