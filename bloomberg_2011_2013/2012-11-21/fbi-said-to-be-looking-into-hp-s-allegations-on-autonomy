The FBI, responding to an inquiry by
the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, is looking into
 Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ) ’s allegations of accounting improprieties at
its Autonomy Corp. unit, a person familiar with the matter said.  Hewlett-Packard brought its claims about the U.K software
company it bought last year to the SEC, which asked the  Federal
Bureau of Investigation  for assistance, said the person, who
asked not to be identified because the matter wasn’t public.
Whenever a company reports a matter that could be criminal in
nature, it will be examined and it wasn’t known whether any
action will result from it, the person said.  Hewlett-Packard yesterday accused Autonomy’s former
managers of a broad range of financial falsehoods resulting in
an $8.8 billion writedown.  More than $5 billion of the charge relates to accounting
missteps, including improperly categorized hardware, Hewlett-
Packard said. The rest is linked to Hewlett-Packard’s share
value and projections that the deal won’t meet expectations,
said the company, which also forecast fiscal first-quarter
profit that missed analysts’ estimates.  Michael Thacker, a spokesman for  Palo Alto , California-
based Hewlett-Packard, didn’t immediately respond to phone and
e-mail messages yesterday seeking comment on the FBI’s actions.  Hewlett-Packard fell 12 percent to $11.71 yesterday,
dropping to the lowest since October 2002. The stock has dropped
55 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
