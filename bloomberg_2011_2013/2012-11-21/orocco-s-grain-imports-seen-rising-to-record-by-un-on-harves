Morocco ’s grain imports are set to
jump 35 percent to a record in the 2013-13 season after cold
weather and a drought curbed local wheat and barley production,
the UN’s Food & Agriculture Organization said.  Purchases may climb to 8.41 million metric tons from 6.24
million tons in 2011-12, the Rome-based United Nations agency
wrote in an online  report  dated yesterday. Imports will include
5.2 million tons of wheat, the FAO said.  Morocco will overtake  Algeria  as  Africa ’s second-largest
wheat buyer behind  Egypt  in the 2012-13 season, the
International Grains Council predicts. Morocco is food-deficient
and imports grain to meet consumption needs even in good years,
according to the FAO.  “Wheat constitutes the bulk of the imports,” the FAO
wrote. “France and  Canada  are likely to re-emerge as dominant
sellers of wheat to Morocco following difficulties with export
supplies in the  Black Sea region .”  The African country’s farmers harvested 3.87 million tons
of wheat this year, falling 36 percent from 6.02 million tons in
2011, the report showed. Late sowing and a cold spell in early
2012 followed by drought conditions hurt output, the FAO said.  Morocco’s barley crop slid 49 percent to 1.2 million tons
from 2.34 million tons, the UN agency said.  Farmers are now planting winter wheat and barley for
harvesting from May, and the agriculture ministry expects the
total grain area to be similar to the previous season at 5
million hectares (12.4 million acres), the FAO said.  Soil Moisture  Above-average rain, while hampering some field work,
“significantly” improved soil moisture, in turn encouraging
early planting, according to the report.  Steps taken by the government to boost crop yields include
providing certified seeds for as little as 40 percent of cost,
the FAO said. The state subsidizes soil testing and as much as
70 percent of purchase prices for farm machinery and irrigation
equipment, it said.  Morocco is also subsidizing crop insurance premiums, with
the insured area predicted to climb to 500,000 hectares from
300,000 hectares this year, the report showed.  “In spite of the country’s high import dependency rate,
the impact of the changes in international prices on domestic
prices was mitigated by government interventions,” the FAO
wrote. “The current poor production is exerting some upward
pressure on food prices.”  The government has said the price of a 200-gram (7-ounce)
loaf of bread should stay at 1.2 dirhams ($0.14), according to
the report.  The Moroccan orange harvest is expected to drop 25 percent
this year as date production rises 10 percent from the five-year
average, the FAO said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
