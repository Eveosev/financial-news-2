Scholastic Corp. (SCHL) , the publisher of
the “ Harry Potter ” and “Hunger Games” books, plunged the
most in almost a decade after the company slashed its profit and
revenue forecasts.  The shares  fell 18 percent to $26.05 at the close in New
York, the biggest one-day decline since February 2003. The stock
had gained 6.2 percent this year through yesterday.  Profit from continuing operations will be $1.40 to $1.60 a
share in fiscal 2013, down from a previous forecast of as much
as $2.40, the New York-based company said yesterday in a
statement. Sales will be $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion, compared
with an earlier projection of as much as $2 billion.  Educational customers are spending less on curriculum
materials, partly because of funding being diverted to
standardized testing, Scholastic said. The company also faces
lower sales of the “Hunger Games” trilogy, which was completed
in 2010, and superstorm Sandy hurt participation in its School
Book Fair and Book Club programs.  Scholastic, whose fiscal year ends in May, will report its
second-quarter results in mid-December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
