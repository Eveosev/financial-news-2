Czech Premier Petr Necas expects
fewer people than initially estimated to enter the new private
pension program designed to boost individual savings for
retirement,  Pravo  newspaper reported, citing him.  The reason for lower participation is a threat by Social
Democrats, the main opposition party, to dismantle the new
private pension plan if the party comes to power, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
