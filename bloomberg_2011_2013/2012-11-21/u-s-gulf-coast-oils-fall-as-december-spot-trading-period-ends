Bonito Sour and other crude oil
grades produced offshore of the U.S. Gulf Coast weakened against
benchmark West Texas Intermediate as traders completed their
final transactions in the December spot market.  Today is the last of three days that cash-market traders
have to finish business for the trading month after the December
oil futures contract expired Nov. 16 in  New York . The period is
characterized by light volume and erratic pricing.  Bonito Sour, a crude oil produced in offshore  Louisiana ,
declined $3.50 to $18.50 a barrel over West Texas Intermediate
delivered at Cushing,  Oklahoma  at 3:46 p.m. in New York.  WTI for December delivery at Cushing gained 57 cents to
$86.93 a barrel, 45 cents cheaper than January futures on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange .  January oil on the exchange settled up 63 cents or 0.7
percent to $87.38 a barrel as U.S. inventories fell unexpectedly
and as fewer Americans filed applications for  unemployment
benefits .  Heavy Louisiana Sweet and Light Louisiana Sweet both
declined $2 a barrel against WTI, with the heavy grade trading
at a $20.50 premium and the light grade at a $21 premium.  Thunder Horse  fell $2 to a $17 premium, while Southern
Green Canyon fell $1 to a $16.50 premium. Both are medium-grade
crude oils produced offshore in the Gulf.  Mars Blend slipped 75 cents to $16.75 a barrel over WTI,
and Posidon dropped $1.25 to a $16.25 premium.  To contact the reporter on this story:
