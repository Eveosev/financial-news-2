OCZ Technology Group Inc. (OCZ) , a maker
of disk drives based on memory chips, said the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission is investigating a customer-incentive
program that forced the company to put off reporting quarterly
results.  The regulatory agency has requested documents and
information concerning the program and press releases dated
Sept. 5 and Oct. 10, among other matters, the  San Jose ,
California-based company said today in a  filing . OCZ said it
intends to cooperate with the investigation and will not comment
further.  In October, the company postponed its fiscal second-quarter
earnings filing, saying revenue for the period will be
“materially lower” than previously thought. The postponement
was prompted by customer-incentive programs discovered after a
September preliminary announcement of earnings for the period.  Ralph Schmitt, who replaced Ryan Petersen as chief
executive officer on Oct. 10, said on a conference call then
that the company had been trying to increase market share “at
all costs.”  Revenue for the quarter ended Aug. 31 will be less than the
$110 million to $120 million forecast on Sept. 5, OCZ said in
the Oct. 10 statement. The company said it expects negative
gross profit margins and a significant net loss for the quarter.  OCZ fell 9.2 percent to $1.08 in extended trading at 6:37
p.m.  New York  time, after the company’s filing. The shares were
unchanged at $1.19 at the New York close and have fallen 82
percent this year.  Bonnie Mott, an OCZ spokeswoman, didn’t immediately return
a call seeking comment on the investigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
