Australia captain  Michael Clarke 
became the first batsman to score four double centuries in a
calendar year to help his team amass 482-5 against South Africa
as their Test cricket series resumed.  Clarke, who is 224 not out, was one of three Australians to
reach triple figures on day one of the second Test as the home
team racked up 5 1/2 runs an over in Adelaide after winning the
toss.  David Warner  blasted 119 off 112 balls, while  Mike Hussey 
made 103 before getting bowled in the final delivery of the day.  Clarke, 31, shared stands of 155 with Warner and 272 with
Hussey to rally Australia from 55-3 and put the home team in
control as it seeks to usurp  South Africa  as the No. 1-ranked
Test team by winning the three-match contest.  The Australian captain came to the crease after his team
lost three wickets in a 16-minute burst in the opening session
and batted through unbeaten until stumps. The 482 runs was a
record team total for a day’s play at the Adelaide Oval.  Clarke moved to 150 by hitting Morne Morkel for five fours
in one over and reached his double century with a single off
spinner Imran Tahir. Hussey smashed the next ball for a six to
bring up his second straight century and 18th in Tests.  Clarke’s unbeaten 243-ball innings, which included 39 fours
and a six, followed his ground-record 259 not out in the series-
opening draw in Brisbane. He also made scores of 329 not out and
210 against India in January.  Warner and Clarke rallied Australia before the opener was
caught at slip in the afternoon session to give Morkel his
second wicket after dismissing Rob Quiney without scoring.
Warner struck 16 fours and four sixes in his third Test century.  South Africa allrounder  Jacques Kallis  removed  Ed Cowan  for
10 and  Ricky Ponting  for 4 before going off with a right
hamstring injury in the opening session. The touring team also
lost fast bowler Vernon Philander to injury before the start of
play when he woke with a sore back.  South Africa would retain the No. 1 spot in the
 International Cricket Council ’s Test rankings by avoiding defeat
in the best-of-three contest, while Australia can overtake the
Proteas at the top with a series victory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
