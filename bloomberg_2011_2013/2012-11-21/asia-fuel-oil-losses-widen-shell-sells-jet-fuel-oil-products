Asia ’s  fuel oil  crack widened to the
biggest spread since May 2011, signaling losses for refiners
turning crude into residual products. Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold
 jet fuel  cargoes for a third day in  Singapore .  Fuel Oil  Fuel oil’s  discount  to Asian marker Dubai crude widened 11
cents to $9.43 a barrel at 2:22 p.m. Singapore time, according
to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
grade, or the  viscosity spread , was unchanged for a second day
at $10 a metric ton, PVM said. This indicates bunker, or marine
fuel, moved in tandem with supplies used in power stations.  Middle Distillates  Shell sold 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  to Trafigura Beheer
BV for Dec. 6 to Dec. 10, the earliest loading period, according
to a Bloomberg News survey of traders who monitored transactions
on the Platts window. The cargo changed hands at a discount of 5
cents a barrel to benchmark quotes.  Shell also sold the same quantity of jet fuel to Hin Leong
Trading Pte for Dec. 14 to Dec. 18 loading, the survey showed.

$1.50 a barrel at 2:22 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
This  regrade  declined for a third day, meaning it’s less
profitable to make  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Gasoil’s premium to Dubai crude increased 48 cents to
$17.80 a barrel, PVM data showed. This  crack spread , a measure
of processing profit, was the widest since Nov. 8.  Light Distillates  The premium of Japan naphtha to London-traded Brent crude
