Nordic electricity for delivery in
the first week of December rose to the highest price in almost
three weeks as forecasts of falling temperatures and less rain
indicated higher demand and less water for hydropower output.  Electricity for delivery from Dec. 3 through Dec. 9 gained
3.7 percent to close at 40.70 euros ($52.13) a megawatt-hour as
of 3:21 p.m. on the Nasdaq OMX Group Inc.’s energy exchange in
Oslo.  That’s the highest closing price since Nov. 1, and compares
with a price of  32.89 euros  a megawatt-hour for power for
around-the-clock delivery tomorrow as set by auction today on
the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo. The higher forward price
indicates traders may expect the average day-ahead baseload
price to rise in the coming weeks.  Temperatures in Oslo may drop to minus 2 degrees Celsius
(28 Fahrenheit) on Nov. 29 from 8 degrees today, according to
 yr.no , the joint website of the Norwegian Meteorological
Institute and the Norwegian Broadcasting Company.  Power for next month gained 2.1 percent to close at 39.35
euros a megawatt-hour, and the contract for delivery in January
through March rose 0.4 percent to 40.30 euros.  Hydropower assets in excess of the seasonal average may
fall by 34 percent to 6.19 terawatt-hours in the next two weeks,
Markedskraft AS data on Bloomberg show.  The Nordic region meets more than half its power needs by
running  water through turbines , which is why rain affects
electricity prices. Norwegian water reservoirs were 85.1 percent
full on Nov. 18, which is 1.6 percentage points more than the
seasonal median and corresponds to 70 terawatt-hours of output,
 Norway ’s  water and energy directorate  said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
