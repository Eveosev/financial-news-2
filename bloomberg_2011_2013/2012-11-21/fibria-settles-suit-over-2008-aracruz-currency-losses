Fibria Celulose SA (FIBR3) , the world’s
largest pulp producer, agreed to settle a lawsuit brought by a
 Miami Beach  municipal pension fund over $2.13 billion of
currency-derivative losses in 2008, according to a court filing.  Terms of the proposed settlement with the City Pension Fund
for Firefighters and Police Officers in the City of Miami Beach
weren’t disclosed in the parties’ joint filing yesterday in
federal court in Miami. They asked the court to stay the case
for 45 days, pending formal approval of the settlement.  The lawsuit was filed in 2008 against Aracruz Celulose SA,
a Brazilian company that was then the world’s largest
eucalyptus-pulp maker. Sao Paulo-based Fibria was formed in 2009
after Votorantim Celulose & Papel SA took over Aracruz.  The pension funds claimed in their complaint that Aracruz
lost more than $2 billion by purchasing currency-derivative
contracts as a “high stakes gamble that went undisclosed to the
company’s shareholders.”  The pension funds sought to proceed on behalf of all
purchasers of Aracruz American depositary receipts from April 7,
2008, to Oct. 2, 2008. The suit hadn’t yet been granted class-
action status.  Joseph White, an attorney for the plaintiffs, and Douglas
P. Baumstein, representing Fibria, declined to comment on the
details of the proposed settlement.  The case is City Pension Fund for Firefighters and Police
Officers in the City of Miami Beach v. Aracruz Cellulose SA,
1:08-cv-23317, U.S. District Court, Southern District of  Florida 
(Miami).  To contact the reporter on this story:
