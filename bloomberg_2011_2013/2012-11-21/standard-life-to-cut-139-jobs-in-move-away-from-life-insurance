Standard Life Plc (SL/) ,  Scotland ’s
biggest insurer, plans to cut 139 jobs at its U.K. unit as it
switches away from selling traditional  life-insurance  policies.  Most of the jobs will go in Scotland and will be in the
firm’s information technology, marketing and advisory divisions,
Standard Life said today in a statement.  Standard Life is selling less life insurance and instead is
focusing on products such as self-invested personal pensions and
employee savings, which require the customer to bear the risk of
the investment losing money rather than the Edinburgh-based
firm. The company has cut costs while spending about 500 million
pounds ($800 million) since 2010 on technology that it says will
boost inflows into fee-based savings products.  “Our current model and structure has to change to meet the
changing demands of this new world where customers will want to
interact in different ways for different products,” Paul Matthews, Standard Life’s chief executive officer for U.K. and
Europe, said in the statement  The stock was  down  0.1 percent at 308.4 pence as of 11:16
a.m. today in London trading, valuing the insurer at about 7.3
billion pounds. Standard Life if the fifth best-performer in the
U.K.’s  benchmark   FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  this year, rising 50 percent
compared to the index’s 3 percent climb.  To contact the reporter on this story:
