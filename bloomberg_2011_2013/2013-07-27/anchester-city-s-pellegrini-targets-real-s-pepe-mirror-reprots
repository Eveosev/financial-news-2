New Manchester City manager Manuel
Pellegrini has targeted Real Madrid defender Pepe as he prepares
to push his spending to over 100 million pounds ($154 million),
the Daily Mirror said.  Pellegrini has already spent 92.3 million on Fernandinho,
Jesus Navas, Alvaro Negredo and Steven Jovetic this offseason as
City looks to reclaim the Premier League title, the Mirror said.
Pepe is rated at 15 million pounds.  “We have the whole month of July and some days of August
to finish completely the squad,” the newspaper quoted
Pellegrini as saying. “It’s not absolutely complete, but it’s
very near to being complete.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
