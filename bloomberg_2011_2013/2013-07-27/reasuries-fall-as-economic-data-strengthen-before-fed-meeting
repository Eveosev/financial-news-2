Treasuries posted their first drop
in three weeks as economic data indicated faster growth before
the  Federal Reserve  meets next week to discuss whether to
continue $85 billion a month in bond purchases.  U.S. debt yields rose as July  consumer confidence  reached
the highest level in six years and the demand for new homes
increased, while the U.S. sold $99 billion of debt to below-average demand. The Fed meets July 30-31, while the  unemployment
rate  may have declined this month, matching the lowest since
2008.  “Supply and hitting recent tops in prices led to a little
bit of selling,” said Michael Lorizio, senior trader at
Manulife Asset Management in  Boston . “We’re settling back into
a new range rather than looking to accelerate too far either way
because of everything next week.”  U.S. 10-year  note yields  rose eight basis points this week,
or 0.08 percentage point, to 2.56 percent, according to
Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The price of the benchmark 1.75
percent security maturing in May 2023 fell 20/32, or $6.25 cents
per $1,000 face amount, to 93. The change was the smallest for a
week since the five days ended June 28.  Treasuries handed investors a loss of 0.3 percent since the
end of June, with the securities poised for a third monthly
decline, the  Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Bond Index (BUSY)  shows. For the
year, the index has fallen 2.6 percent. The MSCI World Index of
shares has returned 5.9 percent in July and 15 percent in 2013,
including reinvested dividends.  Price Swings  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was 81.64 yesterday. The
gauge has fallen from 117.89 on July 5, which was the highest
since December 2010.  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  shifted  to
a net-short position in 10-year note futures in the week ending
July 23, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Speculative short positions, or bets prices will fall,
outnumbered long positions by 32,312 contracts on the Chicago
Board of Trade. Last week, traders were net-long 17,735
contracts.  Traders  increased  their net-long position in two-year note
futures in the week ending July 23, with long positions, or bets
prices will rise, outnumbering short positions by 31,995
contracts, the most since May 17.  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan final index of
U.S. consumer sentiment increased to 85.1 in July from 84.1 the
prior month. The median forecast in a Bloomberg survey called
for 84 in the final July gauge after a preliminary reading of
83.9.  Economic Data  U.S. new-home sales climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized
pace of 497,000 homes, the highest level since May 2008, the
Commerce Department said in  Washington . The median estimate of
77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain to
484,000.  The U.S.  unemployment rate  fell to 7.5 percent in July from
7.6 percent in June, while payrolls climbed by 185,000,
according to economists surveyed before the Labor Department
releases figures on Aug. 2.  “The Fed goes on and on about data dependency; payrolls is
one of the biggest things on the data horizon,” said  Michael Cloherty , head of U.S. interest rate strategist at Royal Bank of
Canada’s RBC Capital Markets unit in  New York , one of 21 firms
that trade directly with the Fed. “The data mix we’ve been
getting is for a weak second quarter, but the third and fourth
look pretty decent.”  Debt Sale  The seven-year notes auctioned July 25 drew bids for 2.54
times the $29 billion offered, the  lowest  since May 2009. The
securities were sold at a high yield of 2.026 percent, up from
1.932 percent at the previous auction on June 27. Investors
submitted a below-average number of bids at the $35 billion
offerings of two-year notes on July 23 and five-year notes on
July 24.  “Demand was a little bit on the tepid side” at the
auctions, said Gary Pollack, who manages $12 billion as head of
fixed-income trading at Deutsche Bank AG’s Private Wealth
Management unit in New York. “The market is preparing itself
for a tapering at some point.”  The central bank, which has been buying  $85 billion  of
bonds each month, will probably start trimming purchases in
September, according to a Bloomberg News survey.  The Fed said in a June 19 statement that leaving the
federal funds rate in that range “will be appropriate at least
as long” as unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and the
forecast for inflation in one-to-two years doesn’t exceed 2.5
percent. Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on July 17 the
jobless rate isn’t the only measure of labor-market health.  The 10-year note yield will end the year a 2.64 percent,
according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of
analysts.  To contact the reporters on this story:
