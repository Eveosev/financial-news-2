(Corrects spelling of Lecter in first paragraph.)  Hannibal Lecter, the cannibal in the
novel “The Silence of the Lambs,” was inspired by a doctor at
a Mexican prison, author Thomas Harris said, according to the
 Times newspaper .  Harris said he met the doctor while working as a journalist
and visiting a prison to interview an American jailed for the
murder of three people, the London-based newspaper reported.  “Dr. Salazar was a small, lithe man with dark red hair,”
Harris was cited as saying by the Times. “He stood very still
and there was a certain elegance about him.”  Lecter, known as Hannibal the Cannibal, first appeared in
Harris’ “Red Dragon” and later in “The Silence of the Lambs”
and two other novels. Harris made the comments about the
inspiration for the character in the foreword to the 25th
anniversary edition of “The Silence of the Lambs,” extracts of
which the Times has published.  Harris has never previously spoken about the inspiration
for the character, the Times said.  Anthony Hopkins  played Lecter
in a movie adaptation of the book, for which he won an Oscar for
best actor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
