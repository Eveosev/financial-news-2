land auction of Shenzhen’s Qianhai special zone.  The Shenzhen, China-based developer will pay 12.4 billion
 yuan  ($2 billion) for the land, according to a statement on the

borders Hong Kong, as the testing ground for freer usage of the
yuan. The authority will spend up to 300 billion yuan by 2015 on
infrastructure and targets a gross domestic product of 150
billion yuan by 2020, Xiao Yafei, director general at the Office
