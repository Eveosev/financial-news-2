SAP AG (SAP)  asked staff to exercise
discipline on costs after the biggest maker of business-management software said it will miss a revenue goal.  The call focuses on external services, travel and
infrastructure expenses, Daniel Reinhardt, a spokesman for the
Walldorf, Germany-based company said in an e-mail to Bloomberg
News today.  Earlier this month, SAP said software and software-related
service revenue will grow at least 10 percent this year, down
from a previous goal of an increase of 11 percent to 13 percent.
The target doesn’t reflect swings in exchange rates and isn’t
based on IFRS accounting rules, according to the company.  SAP wants to save 200 million euros ($265.6 million) in the
second half with the plan, German news magazine  Wirtschaftswoche 
reported on its website today, citing internal company
documents. Reinhardt declined to comment on the report when
contacted by  Bloomberg News  by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
