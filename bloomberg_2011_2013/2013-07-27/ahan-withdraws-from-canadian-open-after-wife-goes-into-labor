Brandt Snedeker holds a one-shot
lead over David Lingmerth entering today’s final round of the
Canadian Open after  Hunter Mahan  withdrew when his wife went
into labor.  Snedeker, 32, of the U.S., shot a 9-under 63 yesterday for
a three-round total of 14-under 202 at Glen Abbey Golf Club in
Oakville, Ontario. Lingmerth, 26, from Sweden, is at 13 under.
Americans  Matt Kuchar  and Jason Bohn are tied at 12 under.  Mahan, 31, had a two-shot lead at 13-under par and had not
teed off yet in the weather-delayed third round when the Golf
Channel showed footage of him taking a call on the practice
range informing him his wife, Kandi, had gone into labor with
the couple’s first child.  To contact the reporter on this story:
