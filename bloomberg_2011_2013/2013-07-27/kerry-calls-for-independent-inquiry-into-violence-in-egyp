Secretary of State  John Kerry  spoke
with Egyptian officials today and called for an independent
inquiry into violence that claimed the lives of dozens of
supporters of ousted president Mohamed Mursi.  Kerry said he “expressed our deep concern about the
bloodshed and violence in Cairo and Alexandria over the past 24
hours” in conversations with Interim Vice President Mohamed
ElBaradei, Interim Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy and European
Union High Representative  Catherine Ashton , according to an e-mailed statement from the State Department.  “At this critical juncture, it is essential that the
security forces and the interim government respect the right of
peaceful protest, including the ongoing sit-in demonstrations,”
Kerry said.  He said the U.S. “urges an independent and impartial
inquiry into the events of the last day, and calls on all of
 Egypt ’s leaders across the political spectrum to act immediately
to help their country take a step back from the brink.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
