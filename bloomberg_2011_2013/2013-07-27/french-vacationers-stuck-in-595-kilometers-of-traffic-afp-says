France â€™s vacationers got stuck in as
many as 595 kilometers (370 miles) of accumulated traffic jams 
across the country today as the summer holiday season took off, 
Agence France-Presse said, citing the French National Center for
Road Information.  Traffic jams, as measured by the distance of vehicles lined
up after being brought to a standstill by heavy circulation, are
expected to reach their peak this summer at about 800 kilometers
on Aug. 3, AFP said.  The heaviest traffic on French roads was observed today in
the southern half of the country, with circulation expected to
return to normal in the evening, the French press agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
