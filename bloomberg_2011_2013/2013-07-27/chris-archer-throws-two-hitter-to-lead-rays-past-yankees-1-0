Chris Archer threw a two-hitter and
Kelly Johnson drove in the only run as the  Tampa Bay  Rays beat
the New York Yankees 1-0.  Archer (6-3) struck out six and walked none at Yankee
Stadium in tossing his second shutout in three starts. The
right-hander allowed a one-out single to Lyle Overbay in the
fifth inning and a two-out double to  Brett Gardner  in the sixth.  Johnson drove in Ben Zobrist with a sixth-inning single
yesterday as the American League East division-leading Rays won
for the 24th time in 29 games.  Ivan Nova (4-4) allowed six hits in seven innings to take
the loss for the Yankees, who fell eight games behind Tampa Bay
in the AL East. Nova struck out eight batters.  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said after the game that
shortstop  Derek Jeter  could return today when the Yankees and
Rays conclude their three-game series.  Jeter was out from the start of the season until July 11
while recovering from a fractured left ankle, then was injured
in his first game back -- suffering a mild thigh strain while
running the bases.  “It’s obviously someone we’ve been waiting for a long
time,” Girardi said. “We had him for one day, we won that
game. Hopefully, his ratio continues.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
