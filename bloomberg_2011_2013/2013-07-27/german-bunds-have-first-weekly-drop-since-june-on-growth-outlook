German  government bonds  declined for
the first week this month as a purchasing managers’ index
signaled euro-area manufacturing expanded in July for the first
time in two years, reducing demand for the safest assets.  The benchmark 10-year yield climbed to a two-week high as a
euro-area services gauge and a German confidence report also
exceeded analyst estimates. The additional yield investors
demand to hold Belgian 10-year debt over bunds shrank to the
least in two weeks, while French and Austrian securities also
outperformed their German counterparts.  “Strong euro-area PMIs have been a significant driver for
higher bund yields,” said Norbert Aul, a European rates
strategist at Royal Bank of Canada in  London . “We expect the
tightening of semi-core spreads against bunds to extend,” with
subdued supply scheduled in the weeks ahead, he said.  Germany ’s 10-year  yield  rose 15 basis points, or 0.15
percentage point, to 1.67 percent at 5 p.m. London time
yesterday, after rising to 1.69 percent on July 25, the highest
since July 9. The price of the 1.5 percent bond due in May 2023
fell 1.31, or 13.10 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,328) face amount,
to 98.515.  German debt has returned 0.8 percent this month, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. It underperformed Belgian
securities’ 1.9 percent gain and French debt’s 1.4 percent
increase, as industry data showed signs of economic recovery.  Economic Expansion  The euro-area manufacturing PMI rose to 50.1 from 48.8 in
June, London-based Markit Economics said on July 24. A reading
above 50 indicates growth. The services index increased to 49.6
from 48.3, exceeding analysts’ forecasts. The Ifo Institute’s
German business climate index, based on a survey of 7,000
executives and published a day later, increased to 106.2 from
105.9 in June.  Belgian 10-year yields increased five basis points to 2.57
percent, reducing the additional yield investors get for holding
the securities instead of bunds by 10 basis points to 90 basis
points. The  spread  reached 86 basis points on July 25, the
narrowest since July 9. French 10-year yields rose nine basis
points to 2.28 percent and  Austria ’s increased 11 basis points
to 2.08 percent.  Belgium  will auction securities due between 2018 and 2041
on July 29.  Italy , which has the euro area’s biggest debt
market, plans to offer a combined 6.75 billion euros of bonds
next week including new benchmark securities. It is also set to
pay about 34 billion euros of bond coupons and redemptions to
investors next month, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
