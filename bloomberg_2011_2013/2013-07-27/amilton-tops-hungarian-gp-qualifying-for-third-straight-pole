Lewis Hamilton  captured his third
straight Formula One pole position during qualifying for
tomorrow’s Hungarian Grand Prix.  Hamilton, of the Mercedes team, posted a time of 1 minute,
19.388 seconds to beat world champion Sebastian Vettel of Red
Bull by 0.038 seconds at the Hungaroring circuit in Budapest.
It’s the fourth pole for the Briton in a season in which he
hasn’t won a race.  “It didn’t feel that great a lap and I was very
surprised,” Hamilton said at a news conference. “The guys have
been working very hard and it’s a result of all that they put
in.”  Hamilton was fifth after  starting on pole  in the most
recent race in  Germany , three weeks ago. He came fourth at last
month’s British Grand Prix and third in China in April after
winning pole.  Lotus’s  Romain Grosjean  was third-fastest and will start on
the second row with Mercedes’s Nico Rosberg. Ferrari’s Fernando Alonso, Lotus’s Kimi Raikkonen, Felipe Massa of Ferrari, STR’s
Daniel Ricciardo, McLaren’s Sergio Perez and Red Bull’s Mark Webber rounded out the top 10 qualifiers.  Vettel has won four of the nine races this season to lead
the standings with 157 points, 34 more than Alonso. Raikkonen is
third with 116 points and Hamilton is fourth with 99.  To contact the reporter on this story:
