The Tampa Bay Rays defeated the  New
York  Yankees 10-6 to take over first place in the American
League East from the  Boston  Red Sox, who lost 6-0 to the
Baltimore Orioles.  James Loney hit a home run and drove in four runs last
night at Yankee Stadium as the Rays (61-42) built a 10-1 lead
over the Yankees by the end of the seventh inning.  The Rays, who were six games behind the Red Sox in fourth
place a month ago, hold a half-game lead over Boston and are 3 ½
games ahead of third-place Baltimore. The Yankees are in fourth
place, seven games behind the Rays in the Major League Baseball
division.  Jeremy Hellickson (10-3) allowed one run on four hits and
struck out three in six innings for the Rays.  The Yankees (54-49) scored five times in the final two
innings, including two run-scoring singles by David Adams.  CC Sabathia (9-9) gave up seven runs on nine hits while
striking out six in five innings.  At Oriole Park at Camden Yards, Adam Jones hit two home
runs, driving in three for Baltimore as Manny Machado and J.J.
Hardy each added solo homers.  Chris Tillman (13-3) gave up two hits and struck out eight
in seven innings for the Orioles (58-46).  John Lackey (7-8), who gave up three of the Orioles’ four
home runs, surrendered five runs on nine hits and struck out two
for the Red Sox (61-43).  To contact the reporter on this story:
