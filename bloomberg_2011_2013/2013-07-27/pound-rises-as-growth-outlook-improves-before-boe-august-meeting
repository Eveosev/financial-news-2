The pound advanced for a third week
versus the dollar as economic data signaling the U.K. recovery
is strengthening boosted demand for the currency.  Sterling rose to the strongest in a month after the  Office
for National Statistics  said on July 25  gross domestic product
 increased 0.6 percent in the second quarter from 0.3 percent in
the first three months of the year. The  Bank of England  will
announce next week its latest monetary policy decision, the
second under the leadership of Governor  Mark Carney , before
issuing its quarterly Inflation Report on Aug. 7. Gilts declined
for the first time in three weeks.  “The data has continued to be supportive for the pound,”
said  Jeremy Stretch , head of currency strategy at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce in  London . “The market’s now thinking
the most likely revisions for growth could be to the topside.
Carney is likely to err on the easier side of policy.”  The pound rose 0.8 percent in the week to $1.5381 at 5:33
p.m. London time yesterday, after climbing to $1.5435 on July
25, the strongest level since June 26. The U.K. currency fell
0.3 percent to 86.33 pence per euro after touching 85.82 pence
on July 23, the strongest since July 10.  The first- and second-quarter economic expansion mark the
first back-to-back periods of growth since 2011. Strengthening
labor-market and retail-sales data in the past month have added
to signs that the economy is on the mend, while a separate
report this week showed new orders at U.K. factories rose to the
highest in seven months in July.  Future Rates  The central bank will maintain its asset-purchase target at
375 billion pounds and  interest rates  at 0.5 percent when the
Monetary Policy Committee meets on Aug. 1, according to
economist estimates in Bloomberg surveys. Also, Carney is
scheduled to explain his approach to outlining the future path
for interest rates with the Aug. 7 Inflation Report.  A gauge of U.K. manufacturing increased for a fifth month
in July, according to economist forecasts before the data next
week.  Sterling rose 0.5 percent in the past three months,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track
10 developed-nation currencies. The euro added 3.3 percent and
the dollar climbed 1.2 percent.  Benchmark 10-year gilt  yields  climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, in the week to 2.33 percent, the biggest
gain since the five days ended June 21. The 1.75 percent
security due in September 2022 fell 0.38, or 3.80 pounds per
1,000-pound face amount, to 95.24.  Gilts pared declines after the Treasury said yesterday that
Jon Cunliffe, a former adviser to Prime Minister  David Cameron ,
would become deputy governor for financial stability at the Bank
of England.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 3.1 percent this year
through July 24, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bunds fell 1.3 percent and Treasuries lost 2.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
