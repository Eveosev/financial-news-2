GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s former  China 
head, Mark Reilly, will return to the country soon to assist
with a government investigation into allegations of bribery.  The company’s global audit team, security personnel and
senior lawyers will also go to Shanghai, China’s Ministry of
Public Security said in a statement dated yesterday. The
ministry said it welcomes the actions and hopes the unit will
resume production and operation as soon as possible.  Glaxo appointed Herve Gisserot yesterday to replace Reilly,
who left China after four executives were detained last month.
Chinese state media published details this week of allegations
the company used cash and sexual favors to bribe doctors and
health officials in the country.  China National Radio reported yesterday that police in the
central city of Zhengzhou are holding 18 Glaxo employees and
medical personnel. The report didn’t provide details about how
and when the staff were detained.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
