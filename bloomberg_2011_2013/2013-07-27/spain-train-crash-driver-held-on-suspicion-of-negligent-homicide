The driver of a speeding train that
crashed in north-western  Spain  killing at least 78 people is
being held on suspicion of negligent homicide, Interior Minister
Jorge Fernandez Diaz said.  Francisco Jose Garzon Amo has left hospital and is now in
police custody, Fernandez Diaz said today at a briefing
broadcast by state-run TVE television from the police station in
the Galician city of Santiago de Compostela.  “He is here,” said Fernandez Diaz. “He is in the legal
situation of being held by the police under the imputation of
the suspected crime of homicide through imprudence.”  As many as 218 passengers were on board the train from
Madrid to Ferrol when it derailed at 8.41 p.m. local time on
July 24 as it rounded a bend on its approach to Santiago de
Compostela. The train wasn’t on high-speed tracks at the moment
of the accident and may have broken a speed limit of 80
kilometers (50 miles) per hour, a Public Works Ministry
spokeswoman said yesterday.  Garzon has so far not commented to investigators. “It’s
also his right to change his mind,” said Fernandez Diaz.  To contact the reporter on this story:
