The defending champion Chiefs
rallied in the second half to defeat the Crusaders 20-19 and
advance to the Super Rugby final.  The Chiefs, who won their first southern hemisphere
provincial championship last year, will host the winner of
todayâ€™s second semifinal between the Bulls and ACT Brumbies on
Aug. 3.  A 17-point burst in 10 second-half minutes erased a 9-3
deficit and lifted the Chiefs to the home win in Hamilton,  New
Zealand . Aaron Cruden scored a try and kicked 10 points for the
Chiefs, while Lelia Masaga also touched down.  Israel Dagg scored the only try of the game for the seven-time champion Crusaders and  Dan Carter  kicked 14 points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
