The U.S. will play  Panama  in the
Gold Cup soccer championship without coach Juergen Klinsmann who
was suspended yesterday for one match by the Concacaf
Disciplinary Committee.  Klinsmann was suspended after he was ejected by a Costa
Rican referee for protesting a challenge on one of his players
in the U.S. 3-1 semifinal victory over  Honduras .  The disciplinary committee said Klinsmann showed “dissent
towards the referee by throwing the ball in a violent manner”
during the game July 24 in Arlington, Texas.  Klinsmann can’t appeal the decision under FIFA rules.  The U.S. meets Panama tomorrow in the championship at
 Soldier Field  in Chicago. Panama advanced to the final with a
2-1 victory over two-time defending champion Mexico.  The U.S. won the last of its four Gold Cup titles in 2007,
two years after it beat Panama in the Central American country’s
only prior visit to the final. Mexico won the past two editions
of the biennial tournament to take its tally to six, while
 Canada  is the only other nation to claim the trophy, in 2000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
