The U.K. government may start
selling its 39 percent stake in  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  within
the next 10 days, though it’s more likely to wait until at least
September, according to a person familiar with the talks.  While the preference is to wait until September or October,
the process could start after Britain’s biggest mortgage lender
reports first-half results on Aug. 1, said the person, who asked
not to be identified because they aren’t authorized to speak
publicly. As much as 5 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) may be
raised, the person said.  The British government, which provided a 20 billion-pound
bailout almost five years ago, earlier this month hired JPMorgan
Chase & Co. to advise on a strategy for returning both Lloyds
and  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  to private investors. The
initial Lloyds transaction would be a test of appetite for a
further offering of shares to both institutional and individual
investors, two people with knowledge of the plan said last week.  Officials at Lloyds and U.K. Financial Investments Ltd.,
which oversees the government’s stake in the bank, declined to
comment. The Financial Times earlier reported that the sale may
begin as early as next week.  Lloyds  shares  have gained 43 percent to 68.37 pence in
 London  this year, valuing the bank at 48.9 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
