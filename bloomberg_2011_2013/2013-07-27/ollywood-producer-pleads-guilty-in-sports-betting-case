A Hollywood producer pleaded guilty
to his part in an illegal sports gambling network that led to
the indictment of 34 people including alleged members and
associates of two Russian-American organized crime groups.  Bryan Zuriff, 44, was the first defendant to plead guilty
in the case, according to a statement yesterday from U.S.
Attorney Preet Bharara in  New York . He faces a sentence of as
long as five years in prison and he has agreed to forfeit
$500,000 as part of his plea agreement, according to the
statement.  “Bryan Zuriff spanned the coasts with his crimes, by
operating his own illegal gambling enterprise in Los Angeles,
and helping to operate a vast illegal gambling enterprise in New
York,” Bharara said. “With his plea, he becomes the first
defendant, but not the last, to be convicted in this sprawling
script of criminal conduct.”  Zuriff, of Brentwood,  California , operated his own sports
book and assisted other defendants who ran their own illegal
gambling business in New York that catered to millionaires and
billionaires, according the U.S. attorney’s statement.  Zuriff was an executive producer of the Showtime television
series “Ray Donovan,” according to the  IMDb  website.  Charles Clayman, a lawyer for Zuriff, didn’t immediately
respond after regular business hours to a phone call to his
office seeking comment on the guilty plea.  The case is U.S. v. Tokhtakhounov, 13-cr-00268, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
