 Pamplona Capital Management LLP,
the investment group whose backers include Russian billionaire
 Mikhail Fridman ’s  Alfa Group , agreed to buy French funeral group
OGF SA for about 900 million euros ($1.2 billion), said three
people with knowledge of the situation.  London-based Pamplona signed a binding agreement with
current owner Astorg Partners yesterday to buy Paris-based OGF,
according to the people, who asked not to be identified because
the talks are private. OGF also attracted bids from CVC Capital
Partners Ltd. and  Lion Capital LLP , the people said.  The senior management team of OGF, which provides funeral
and crematorium services across France, are expected to re-invest in the business alongside Pamplona, the people said.
Paris-based private-equity firm Astorg bought OGF for 780
million euros in 2007.  Pamplona, which manages both private-equity and hedge fund
investments, is currently investing a 2-billion euro pool of
capital it raised in 2011. OGF is the first private-equity deal
it has completed in  Europe  this year, according to its website.  Officials at Pamplona and Astorg declined to comment when
contacted, while a spokesman for OGF didn’t immediately respond
to telephone requests for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
