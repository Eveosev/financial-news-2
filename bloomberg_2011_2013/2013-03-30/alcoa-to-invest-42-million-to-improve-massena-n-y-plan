Alcoa Inc. (AA)  agreed to invest $42
million to prepare for the upgrade of a smelter at its Massena,
New York, aluminum plant, as part of a long-term power supply
accord with the New York Power Authority.  The largest U.S. aluminum producer also will provide $10
million for a North Country Economic Development Fund, New York
Governor  Andrew Cuomo  said in a statement. The agreement is
expected to help keep at least 900 jobs at the site, the
governor said.  The project is awaiting approval from the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, which put forth a plan for
cleanup of the Grasse River. The decision is expected next
month, the governor’s office said.  As part of a long-term power supply agreement with NYPA in
2008, Alcoa must invest at least $600 million to modernize the
Massena operations, the statement said. Alcoa agreed to set up
the fund to boost economic development in New York’s St.
Lawrence, Franklin, Essex, Jefferson, Lewis, Hamilton and
Herkimer counties as well as on the Akwesasne Mohawk
reservation.  The new power contract will begin January 2014, and extends
to 2045, with a 10-year option to extend  service , Cuomo said in
the statement.  Massena is about 400 miles (643 kilometers) north-northwest
of New York City on the border with the provinces of Ontario and
Quebec.  To contact the reporter on this story:
