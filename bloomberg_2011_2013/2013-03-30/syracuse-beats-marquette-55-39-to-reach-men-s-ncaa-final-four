Syracuse University and Wichita
State University are the first two teams to advance to the Final
Four of the national men’s college basketball championship.  Their opponents will be decided today when third-seeded
Florida plays No. 4 Michigan in the South regional final and
top-seeded Louisville faces No. 2 Duke in the Midwest regional
final.  Ninth-seeded Wichita State topped No. 2 Ohio State 70-66 in
the West regional final yesterday. Syracuse, seeded fourth in
the East region, beat No. 3 Marquette 55-39, for its fifth trip
to the Final Four and the first since 2003, when it won the
National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament.  “Once we got in the Big East Tournament, we started to
play good,” said Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim in a televised
interview. “It carried over into the NCAA tournament. When you
bounce back like that, that says a lot about your kids, your
team and your character. This is a heck of a bounce-back.”  Syracuse (30-9) will play Florida or Michigan, who meet
today in the South regional final, on April 6 in Atlanta.  James Southerland scored 16 points, C.J. Fair added 13 and
Michael Carter-Williams had 12 points and 10 rebounds.  “I had a great game,” Carter-Williams said. “I think
this was one of my best.”  The Orange last went to the Final Four in 2003, when the
team was led by Carmelo Anthony, who is the  New York  Knicks’
leading scorer this season.  ‘Every 10 Years’  “It’s a great thing,” Boeheim said. “We go every 10
years. Every 10 years is our time.”  Vander Blue and Davante Gardner each scored 14 points for
the third-seeded Golden Eagles (26-9), who hit 12 of 53 from the
floor for 23 percent.  “They beat us start to finish,” Marquette coach Buzz Williams said. “When we get beat, we get beat.”  At Staples Center in Los Angeles, Malcolm Armstead scored
14 points to lead the Shockers to their second appearance in the
Final Four, the first coming in 1965.  “Last year we were watching all this on television,” said
Cleanthony Early, who scored 12 points. “Now I’m looking at a
hat that says ‘Final Four Atlanta’ with my team on it. It feels
good, and it feels even better that I could experience it with
these guys who had to struggle so hard to get here.”  Wichita State (30-8) was ahead by as many as 20 points with
12 minutes, 41 seconds left to go in the game before the
Buckeyes hit nine straight free throws to trail by 56-45.  Ohio State (29-8) chipped away at the Shockers’ lead before
running out of time.  “We didn’t get many easy buckets and it shows,” said Ohio
State’s Aaron Craft, who hit 2-of-12 field goal attempts for
nine points. “They came out firing and we didn’t regain our
balance until it was too late.”  Fred Van Vleet had 12 points and Tekele Cotton added 10 for
Wichita State which had a 35-22 halftime lead.  DeShaun Thomas scored 23 points and LaQuinton Ross added 19
points for the Buckeyes.  The Final Four will be played April 6 in Atlanta with the
championship game two days later.  To contact the reporter on this story:
