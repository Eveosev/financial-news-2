Animal Kingdom, winner of the 2011
 Kentucky Derby , ran to a two-length victory in the $10 million
Dubai  World Cup , the world’s richest horse race.  Animal Kingdom, ridden by Joel Rosario with 11-2 odds,
captured the 1 1/4-mile event at Meydan Racecourse in a time of
two minutes, 03.21 seconds. The 5-year-old is the first American
horse to win the World Cup since Well Armed in 2009.  “Turning for home, he was looking around,” said Rosario.
“I was hoping I had enough horse left because it’s a long
stretch.”  Red Cadeaux, at 25-1, was second, with 10-1 shot Planteur
third in the 12-horse field.  Barry Irwin’s Team Valor sold a majority interest in Animal
Kingdom to John Messara’s Arrowfield Stud, based north of Sydney
in Scone,  Australia . The stallion, with $8.4 million in lifetime
winnings, will begin his stud career in Australia in September.  Royal Delta set the early pace ahead of Side Glance, Animal
Kingdom and 11-4 favorite Hunter’s Light. Rosario took Animal
Kingdom to the front with about 2 ½ furlongs left and held off a
late charge from Red Cadeaux along the rail for the win.  Hunter’s Light faded and finished back in the pack.
Defending champion Monterosso was scratched from the race
earlier yesterday after becoming lame.  Animal Kingdom won the Kentucky Derby, the first leg of U.S.
racing’s Triple Crown, as a 20-1 longshot. He was favored in the
remaining two races, but finished second at the  Preakness Stakes 
and sixth at the Belmont Stakes.  To contact the reporter on this story:
