Anglo American Plc (AAL) , the metals
producer with mines from Chile to Zimbabwe, said three bodies
were found after the collapse of a port used for loading iron-
ore shipments on  Brazil ’s Amazon River.  The cause of the accident at the port of Santana is being
investigated as rescuers look for three others missing, Anglo
American said.  The search “will continue intensively,” the company said
today in an e-mailed statement.  Anglo said yesterday an “abnormally large wave of water
rushing down the river” in the early morning hours of March 28
dragged vehicles and shipping equipment into the river and may
have triggered a landslide at the port.  Anglo has said operations at its nearby Amapa mine, which
it agreed in January to sell to Zamin Ferrous Ltd., continue as
normal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
