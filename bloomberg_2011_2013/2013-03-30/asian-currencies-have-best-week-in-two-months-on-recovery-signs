Asian currencies had their best
week in more than two months on speculation an economic recovery
in the U.S. will boost demand for the region’s exports.  Gross domestic product in the world’s largest economy rose
faster than previously estimated in the fourth quarter, while
orders for durable goods climbed more than forecast in February,
reports showed this week. The Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar
Index, which tracks the 10 most-active currencies in the region
excluding the yen, advanced 0.2 percent since March 22.  “The expectation is that the  U.S. economy  will continue to
improve,” said Yeah Kim Leng, chief economist at RAM Holdings
Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur. “With a stronger U.S. recovery, export-
oriented Asian economies will benefit, strengthening their
currencies.”  The ringgit advanced 0.6 percent this week to 3.0938 per
dollar in Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
South Korea’s won climbed 0.7 percent to 1,111.35 and Taiwan’s
dollar rose 0.1 percent to NT$29.875.  The Asia Dollar Index lost 0.3 percent this month as global
investors pulled $2.8 billion out of the stock markets of South
Korea and Taiwan amid concern  Europe ’s debt crisis will worsen.  The Malaysian currency touched a five-week high of 3.0859
on March 25 after the central bank said last week that gross
domestic product will increase as much as 6 percent this year
from 5.6 percent in 2012. Prime Minister Najib Razak has
embarked on a $444 billion spending program to build railways,
roads and power plants in an effort to lift the country to
developed-nation status by 2020.  Yuan Rises  The  yuan  touched a 19-year high yesterday after the
People’s Bank of China raised the  reference rate  to the
strongest level in more than 10 months.  The PBOC increased the daily  fixing  by 0.08 percent to
6.2689 per dollar, the highest since May 2, 2012. The currency
is allowed to trade 1 percent either side of the rate. The
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index for manufacturing in March will be
51.2, indicating a sixth month of expansion, according to the
 median estimate  in a Bloomberg News survey of economists before
official data on April 1.  “Investors continue to be convinced about the gradual
appreciation of the yuan,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund
manager  at Uni-President Assets Management Corp., which oversees
$700 million.  The yuan advanced 0.02 percent this week to 6.2108 per
dollar, prices from the China Foreign Exchange Trade System show.
The currency rose as high as 6.2086 yesterday, the strongest
level since the government unified official and market exchange
rates at the end of 1993.  Korean Won  The won had the first weekly gain in almost a month after
data showed  South Korea ’s current-account surplus widened in
February.  The surplus increased to $2.71 billion from $2.33 billion
in January, the  Bank of Korea  said on March 28. The gap for
March is likely to be similar as improving exports will offset
an expected rise in dividend payments to foreign investors,
according to Cho Yong Seung, a central bank official.  Elsewhere, Thailand’s baht was steady from a week earlier
at 29.28 per dollar, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Financial markets in  India ,  Indonesia  and  Philippines  were
closed yesterday. India’s rupee gained 0.1 percent from March 22
to 54.28 per dollar on March 28, while Indonesia’s rupiah
advanced 0.3 percent to 9,715. The Philippine peso appreciated
0.1 percent to 40.823 on March 28.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
