Louis Susman, the outgoing U.S.
ambassador to the U.K., said further cuts to Britain’s  defense
spending  would raise alarm for the Washington administration,
the  Daily Telegraph  reported.  The U.S. would have to “review the situation” if the U.K.
were to make additional reductions in spending on top of cuts
agreed in 2010, as it would jeopardize the nation’s defense
capabilities, Susman, 75, told the newspaper in an interview.
The US. government is pushing Britain to continue defense
spending at 2 percent of gross domestic product, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
