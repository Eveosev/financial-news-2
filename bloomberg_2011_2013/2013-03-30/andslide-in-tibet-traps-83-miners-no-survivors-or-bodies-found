A landslide at a Chinese-run mine
in  Tibet  trapped 83 workers, and after 28 hours rescuers have
yet to find any survivors or recover bodies, the official Xinhua
news agency reported today.  The chances of survival for those buried are slim as rescue
efforts are hindered by the high altitude and low temperatures,
Xinhua said. Two of those trapped are Tibetan and the rest are
 Han Chinese  migrant workers from neighboring provinces of Yunnan,
Guizhou and Sichuan.  President Xi Jinping and Premier Li Keqiang have ordered
every effort be made to rescue the workers, Xinhua said.  The Jiama copper and gold mine in Maizhokunggar county near
Lhasa is the Chinese government’s biggest project to tap mineral
resources in Tibet, with planned investment of 5 billion  yuan 
($805 million) through 2015, according to the industry
ministry’s website.  The mine is operated by the Huatailong Mining Development
