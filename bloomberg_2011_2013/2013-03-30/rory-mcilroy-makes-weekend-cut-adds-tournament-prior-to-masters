Rory McIlroy, the No. 2 player in
the  Official World Golf Ranking , will play the PGA Tour
tournament prior to the Masters after qualifying for weekend
play at the Houston Open on the 36-hole cut line.  McIlroy added next week’s Texas Open in San Antonio to his
schedule, according to a  statement  on the tournament’s website.
The 23-year-old from Northern Ireland shot a two-under 70
yesterday to finish on the one-under-par cut line at Redstone
Golf Club in Humble, Texas, and heads into play today nine
strokes behind tournament leader Steve Wheatcroft of the U.S.  Wheatcroft, a 35-year-old who qualified for the tournament
on March 25, is alone atop the Houston Open leaderboard at 10-
under, one stroke ahead of fellow Americans D.A. Points and
Jason Kokrak. Phil Mickelson, a four-time major winner, is tied
with McIlroy at one-under for the tournament.  Defending-champion Hunter Mahan missed the cut, as did
Australian Geoff Ogilvy and American Mark O’Meara.  Players often skip at least one tournament prior to the
Masters, the season’s first major championship, which begins
April 11 this year in Augusta,  Georgia . McIlroy, for example,
took off three weeks prior to the Masters last year, according
to ESPN.  A two-time major champion, McIlroy has played three events
this season, according to his PGA Tour profile. He lost the No.
1 spot in the world rankings to Tiger Woods earlier this week
after Woods won the Arnold Palmer Invitational.  To contact the reporter on this story:
