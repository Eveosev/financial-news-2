Chelsea has moved ahead of
Manchester City and Real Madrid in the race to sign Atletico
Madrid striker Radamel Falcao, the Daily Star said.  Chelsea has opened talks with Atletico and both sides are
confident of reaching a deal to send the Colombian, who is rated
at 40 million pounds ($61 million), to  Stamford  Bridge after the
season, the Star said.  Chelsea tried to sign Falcao in the past two transfer
periods and one option available is offering Fernando Torres
back to Atletico as part of a deal, the Star said. The Blues
could also allow goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois to extend his loan
stay at Atleico, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
