J.R. Smith scored 37 points as the
 New York Knicks  beat the Charlotte Bobcats yesterday for their
seventh consecutive win, while the  Miami Heat  were victorious in
their first game since their 27-game winning streak ended.  The Brooklyn Nets fell 109-87 to the  Denver Nuggets  and
National Basketball Association’s Western Conference-leading San
Antonio Spurs won on a three-point play in the final seconds.  The Knicks (45-26) took a lead with their first field goal
of the game and never trailed again, as Smith scored at least 30
points for the third consecutive game and forward Carmelo Anthony added 32 points at Madison Square Garden. New York’s
seven-game winning streak is their longest of the season, and
the longest current streak in the NBA.  “He is dialed in, locked in,” Anthony said of Smith after
the game. “His confidence is sky-high. We are following his
lead.”  Last year’s league Most Valuable Player,  LeBron James ,
scored 36 points to lead the Heat to a 108-89 victory over the
New Orleans Hornets in Miami’s first game since having a 27-game
winning streak, the second-longest in NBA history, snapped in
Chicago. Dwyane Wade added 11 points and nine assists for Miami,
who have an 11 1/2-game lead over the Knicks in the Eastern
Conference standings.  The Western Conference-leading Spurs (55-17) beat the Los
Angeles Clippers 104-102 on a three-point play from  Tim Duncan 
with 2.2 seconds remaining. The Oklahoma City Thunder (53-20),
who trail the Spurs in the conference by 2 1/2 games, fell 101-
93 to the Minnesota Timberwolves, their third loss in the last
six games.  Elsewhere around the league it was the Orlando Magic 97,
Washington Wizards 92; Boston Celtics 118, Atlanta Hawks 107;
Toronto Raptors 99, Detroit Pistons 82; Memphis Grizzlies 103,
Houston Rockets 94; Utah Jazz 105, Portland Trail Blazers 95;
and Philadelphia 76ers 97, Cleveland Cavaliers 87.  To contact the reporter on this story:
