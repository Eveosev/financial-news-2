Jockey JT McNamara suffered
paralysis in a fall earlier this month at English horse racing’s
Cheltenham Festival, his family said in a statement.  The 37-year-old amateur from Ireland fractured two
vertebrae in his neck after falling from Galaxy Rock in the
Challenge Cup race on March 14. He was remains at Frenchay
Hospital in Bristol after undergoing surgery, though plans are
being made to transfer him to Matar Hospital in Dublin.  “While he suffered a serious neck injury resulting in
paralysis, he has made progress in the last week and is in a
very positive frame of mind,” according to a  statement  on
behalf of McNamara’s family posted today on the website of the
Injured Jockeys Fund.  McNamara was placed in a medically induced coma, after
which his family said he was “fully alert” but required full-
time ventilation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
