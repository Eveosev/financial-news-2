Martin O’Neill  was fired as
Sunderland manager with the club fighting relegation in English
soccer’s Premier League.  Sunderland announced the move on its website hours after a
1-0 loss to league leader  Manchester United . The defeat left the
Black Cats 16th in the 20-team league, one point above the three
relegation positions at the bottom of the standings.  “Sunderland AFC has announced that it has parted company
with manager Martin O’Neill this evening,” a statement on the
club’s website read. “An announcement will be made in the
coming days regarding a successor.”  O’Neill, 61, took over as coach in December 2011, replacing
the fired Steve Bruce. Sunderland’s next game is April 7 at
Chelsea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
