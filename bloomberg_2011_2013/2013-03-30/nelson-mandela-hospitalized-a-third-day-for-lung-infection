Nelson Mandela  is able to breathe
“without difficulty” after a procedure was performed to drain
excess fluid from around his lungs, according to a spokesman for
South African President  Jacob Zuma .  The nation’s first black president remains in the hospital
for a third day in Pretoria, the capital, being treated for
pneumonia, Zuma’s spokesman,  Mac Maharaj , said in an e-mailed
statement. “He continues to respond to treatment and is
comfortable,” Maharaj said.  Mandela, 94, was admitted before midnight local time on
March 27, his second hospital visit this year after a check-up
less than three weeks ago. His health took a “downturn” that
day and he was brought to the hospital to prevent the infection
from spreading, Maharaj told Johannesburg-based broadcaster eNCA
March 28.  The Nobel Peace Prize winner was hospitalized from Dec. 8
to Dec. 26 to treat a lung infection and to have gallstones
removed. He contracted tuberculosis while imprisoned on Robben
Island during his 27-year incarceration for fighting white
minority rule. Mandela led South Africa for five years after the
 African National Congress , or ANC, won the first all-race
elections in 1994 that marked the end of apartheid rule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
