Buster Posey signed the most
lucrative contract in San Francisco Giants history after a 2012
season in which he won the National League’s Most Valuable
Player award and batting title, according to MLB.com.  The 26-year-old catcher agreed to a nine-year, $167 million
contract, the website reported today citing an unidentified
person familiar with the deal. The Major League Baseball club
has an option for a 10th season that could raise the value of
the contract to $186 million, according to the report.  Posey hit an NL-best .336 last season, with 24 home runs
and 103 runs batted in, becoming the first catcher in 40 years
to be named NL MVP.  He helped the Giants to their second World Series title in
the past three years, a four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers.
San Francisco also won a World Series title in 2010, when Posey
was named NL Rookie of the year.  Giants pitcher Matt Cain’s six-year $127.5 million deal was
the highest contract in team history before Posey’s, according
to MLB.com.  To contact the reporter on this story:
