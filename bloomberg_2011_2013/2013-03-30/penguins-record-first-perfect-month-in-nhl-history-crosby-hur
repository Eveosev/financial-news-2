The Pittsburgh Penguins capped the
first perfect month in National Hockey League history with a 2-0
victory over the  New York  Islanders, extending their winning
streak to 15 games, two shy of their own league record.  Pittsburgh captain  Sidney Crosby  needed surgery on his
mouth last night after he was hit in the face when a shot by his
defenseman Brooks Orpik deflected off a stick.  “Sidney took a puck to the teeth and lost a few,” head
coach Dan Bylsma said on the team’s website. “We’ll continue to
evaluate and monitor that.”  During the past two years, Crosby missed the final 41 games
in 2011 and the Stanley Cup finals with a concussion, as well as
most of the 2012 regular season with lingering symptoms.  “When you see the replay, he had no chance to move,”
forward Jarome Iginla told reporters after his debut with the
Penguins.  After two scoreless innings on home ice at Consol Energy
Center, Matt Cooke scored eight minutes into the final period
and James Neal added a second goal five minutes later.  Goalie Tomas Vokoun made 35 saves as the Penguins, 15-0-0
in March, need two more wins to match the record 17 straight
victories set by  Mario Lemieux  and the 1992-93 Penguins.  “The shutout is nice, but preserving the winning streak is
even better,” Vokoun said. “It’s been great.”  Pittsburgh’s next two games are a visit from the  Buffalo
Sabres  on April 2 and a trip to Madison Square Garden to face
the  New York Rangers  on April 3.  Pittsburgh has the best record in the NHL at 28-8-0 for 56
points. The  Chicago Blackhawks  are second at 25-5-3 for 53
points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
