Afghan President  Hamid Karzai  is
traveling to Qatar today to discuss the opening of a Taliban
office there that will facilitate peace talks, according to his
spokesman, Aimal Faizi.  The leader’s agenda includes “issues of peace efforts with
Taliban and the opening of an office for them in Qatar,” Faizi
said by phone. He will meet with the Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani, and other senior officials, according an
e-mailed statement from Karzai’s office.  Afghan Foreign Minister Zalmai Rassoul and Salahuddin
Rabbani, chairman of the country’s high peace council, are
traveling with Karzai on the two-day trip.  Having an office with a direct line to Taliban militants
may open the way for peace talks with Afghan officials and help
end a 12-year conflict that started after the Sept. 11, 2001
attacks on the U.S., Jawid Kohistani, a Kabul-based political
analyst, said by phone. Karzai is trying “to guarantee the
whole country’s security,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
