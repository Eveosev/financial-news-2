Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock
index snapped a four-day advance, led down by petrochemical
companies.  The Tadawul All Share Index slid 0.3 percent to close at
7,157.64 in Riyadh.  Saudi Basic Industries Corp. (SABIC) , the world’s
largest petrochemical maker, declined 0.5 percent to 97 riyals,
the lowest level since March 25.  National Industrialization Co. (NIC) ,
the petrochemicals maker known as Tasnee, fell 1.6 percent, the
most since Jan. 21, to 31 riyals. The gauge of the Arab world’s
biggest stock exchange has added 5.2 percent this year.  “The Saudi index closed in an up-trend last week at its
highest level since May and this week is the last week before
first-quarter earnings start coming out,” said Turki Fadaak,
head of research and consultancy at Albilad Investment Co. “I
think the movement of the market is going to be volatile during
the week until earning results.”  Saudi Arabia ’s stock exchange is the only Persian Gulf
bourse open on Saturdays.  To contact the reporter on this story:
