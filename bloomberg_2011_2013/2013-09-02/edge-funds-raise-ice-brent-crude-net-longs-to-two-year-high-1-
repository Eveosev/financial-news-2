Hedge funds and other money managers
raised  bullish bets  on  Brent crude  to the highest in more than
two years, according to ICE Futures  Europe .  Speculative bets that prices will rise, in futures and
options combined, outnumbered short positions by 231,962 lots in
the week to Aug. 27, the London-based exchange said today in its
weekly Commitments of Traders report. That’s up 11 percent from
last week and is the most since at least January 2011, the
starting point for the data series.  Bearish positions by producers, merchants, processors and
users of Brent outnumbered bullish positions by 411,529, a 2
percent expansion from the week before, leaving their  net-short 
position at the largest since the data began.  Brent advanced 3.8 percent in the week to Aug. 27 to
$114.36 a barrel and traded at $114.30 as of 12:01 p.m. local
time today.  ICE publishes, usually each Monday, aggregate numbers for
long and short positions for speculators such as  hedge funds  and
institutional investors, as well as commercial companies that
buy or sell futures to protect against price moves. Analysts and
investors follow changes in speculators’ positions because such
transactions can reflect an expectation of a change in prices.  Swaps dealers reduced net-long positions in Brent to the
lowest since April 16, by 8.1 percent to 191,606.  Money managers’ net-long bets on European  gasoil  rose for a
second week, climbing 15 percent to 75,832 lots, the highest
since March 5.  To contact the reporter on this story:
