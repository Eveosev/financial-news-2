Bulgaria  may ask the European Union
and Red Cross for aid in handling an increase in Syrian refugees
as President  Barack Obama  seeks congressional approval for a
strike on the Middle-East country.  Bulgaria, which shares a border with Turkey, may have to
provide shelter for as many as 10,000 Syrians by year end,
Interior Minister Tsvetlin Yovchev said in an e-mailed statement
in the capital Sofia today.  Bulgarian refugee centers are full and the government is
looking for additional locations to accommodate a rise in people
illegally crossing the border with Turkey, he said.  The UN estimates more than 100,000 people have been killed
in  Syria  since the push to drive President Bashar al-Assad from
power 2 1/2 years ago deteriorated into civil war. The number of
Syrians fleeing to adjacent countries including  Turkey , Iraq,
Lebanon and Jordan has surged and spread to Bulgaria, Serbia and
other countries.  “Should the crisis escalate and there is a tide of
refugees we can expect between 6,000 and 10,000 people by the
end of the year,” Yovchev said in the statement. “This exceeds
our potential.”  About 3,000 illegal migrants were caught crossing the
border in the first eight months of the year, of which about
1,600 were Syrians, according to the Interior Ministry. That
compares with about 2,000 migrants detained last year.  Serbian authorities detained 432 Syrians out of 2,232
people who crossed the country’s borders illegally in the first
seven months, up from 287 Syrians in 2012, the  Interior Ministry 
in Belgrade said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
