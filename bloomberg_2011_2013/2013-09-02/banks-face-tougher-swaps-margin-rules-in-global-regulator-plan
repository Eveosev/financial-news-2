 Banks may have to put more
collateral behind trades of over-the-counter derivatives as
global regulators seek to choke off opportunities for excessive
risk taking.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and
International Organization of Securities Commissions said that
the plans, which target swaps traded away from clearinghouses,
would ensure lenders have safeguards in place when a trading
partner defaults.  The rules would kick in after a 50 million-euro threshold
($66 million,) the Basel group said on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
