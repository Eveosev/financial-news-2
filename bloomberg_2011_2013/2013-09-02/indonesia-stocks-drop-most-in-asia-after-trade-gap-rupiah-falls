Indonesian stocks declined most in
Asia and the rupiah weakened after the government unexpectedly
reported the biggest trade deficit since at least 2007.  The Jakarta Composite Index fell 2.2 percent to 4,101.234
at the close, after climbing 0.3 percent earlier.  PT Indofood
Sukses Makmur (INDF) , the nation’s biggest instant-noodle maker, sank
9.2 percent after it offered to buy China Minzhong Food Corp.
The rupiah slid 0.5 percent to 10,979 per dollar and one-month
non-deliverable forwards on the currency declined 0.5 percent to
11,497, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The trade  gap  in July reached $2.3 billion, exceeding all
16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Indonesia raised its
reference  rate  by half a percentage point at an additional
meeting last week, while the government said Aug. 23 it will
allow more mineral exports this year as policy makers seek to
narrow the trade deficit and stem declines in the rupiah that
have stoked inflation. The Jakarta stock  gauge  lost 9 percent in
August and the rupiah weakened 5.9 percent.  “The widening deficit shows how serious  Indonesia ’s
economic condition is,” said Edwin Sebayang, the head of
research at PT MNC Securities in Jakarta. “This is what caused
the reversal in the stock market.”  Consumer prices  climbed  8.79 percent last month from a year
earlier after an 8.61 percent gain in July, a separate report
from the Statistics Bureau showed today. The increase was the
biggest since January 2009 and compared with the 8.95 percent
median estimate in a survey of 21 economists.  Indofood Offer  The nation’s current-account gap widened to a record $9.8
billion in the second quarter, according to central bank data
released last month.  Indofood  offered  to buy the remaining Minzhong stock it
doesn’t already own for S$1.12 per share, according to a
statement today. Minzhong traded at S$0.53 before it was halted
in  Singapore . The vegetable processor slumped 48 percent on Aug.
26 after a report by short-seller Glaucus Research Group that
questioned the company’s accounts. Minzhong denied the
allegations.   PT Astra International (ASII) , Indonesia’s biggest auto retailer,
fell 2.5 percent. PT Unilever Indonesia declined 1.9 percent.  PT
Bank Mandiri (BMRI) , the nation’s largest lender by assets, retreated
5.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
