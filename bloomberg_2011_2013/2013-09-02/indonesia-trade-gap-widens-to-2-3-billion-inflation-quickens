Indonesia  unexpectedly reported the
biggest trade deficit since at least 2007 while inflation
accelerated further, renewing pressure on policy makers as they
grapple with a slumping currency. Stocks and the rupiah fell.  The trade  gap  in July reached $2.3 billion, exceeding all
16 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey, a report showed today.
 Consumer prices  climbed 8.79 percent last month from a year
earlier after a previously reported 8.61 percent gain in July,
the Statistics Bureau said in Jakarta. The increase was the
biggest since January 2009 and compared with the 8.95 percent
median in a survey of 21 economists.  The numbers showed the challenge for Indonesia, which joins
emerging economies from  Brazil  to Turkey and  India  in taking
steps to support currencies as the prospect of reduced U.S.
monetary stimulus spurs a sell-off in their markets.  Bank
Indonesia  raised its  reference rate  by half a percentage point
at an unscheduled meeting last week, while the government said
Aug. 23 it will allow more mineral exports this year and
increase a luxury-goods tax to narrow the  trade gap .  “The widening deficit shows how serious Indonesia’s
economic condition is,” said Edwin Sebayang, head of research
at PT MNC Securities in Jakarta. “This is what caused the
reversal in the stock market.”  The rupiah fell 0.2 percent to 10,940 per dollar as of
12:20 p.m. in Jakarta today, after falling 5.9 percent in August
to be the second-worst performer among 11 widely traded Asian
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. The benchmark Jakarta Composite
Index of stocks slid 2.1 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
