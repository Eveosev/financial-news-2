South African vehicle  sales  dropped
unexpectedly in August, the first decline since March.  Sales fell 0.3 percent from a year earlier to 56,112
vehicles, the Pretoria-based National Association of Automobile
Manufacturers of South Africa said in an e-mailed statement
today. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of four
economists was for sales to grow 4.8 percent.  The Reserve Bank has held the benchmark repurchase rate at
5 percent for more than a year as  inflation  pressure limits its
options to cut rates and stimulate the economy. Inflation at 6.3
percent in July exceeded the bank’s 3 percent to 6 percent
target range for the first time in 15 months.  Passenger-car sales fell 3.7 percent in August from a year
earlier to 38,892, while sales of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, rose 5.3 percent to 14,376,
the industry association said. Vehicles exports dropped 23
percent to 19,284.  The rand gained 0.6 percent to 10.2226 per dollar at 2:44
p.m. in Johannesburg, trimming this year’s decline to 17
percent.  RGT Smart compiles the data for the industry association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
