Norway ’s women conductors voiced
shock and outrage after Vasily Petrenko, the Russian chief
conductor of the Oslo Philharmonic, was quoted by the daily
Aftenposten saying orchestras react better to men than to women.  Petrenko, 37, told the newspaper that orchestras react
better to men, who “have less sexual energy and can focus more 
on the music” while women on the podium could be distracting, 
Aftenposten said. Women often find it hard to be as devoted to 
the job as is necessary once they have children, Petrenko told 
the newspaper.  The Norwegian conductor Halldis Roenning said she found
Petrenko’s comments “ridiculous and totally unreasonable,”
Aftenposten reported. Conductor Cathrine Winnes Trevino said
Petrenko’s views were “antiquated” and “unacceptable.”  Petrenko , who is also the principal guest conductor at the
Mikhailovsky Theatre in  St. Petersburg , later sought to clarify
his comments, saying in a  post  on the orchestra’s website that
he was talking about the situation for female conductors in
Russia. Petrenko said he has the “utmost respect for female
conductors” and would encourage any girl to study conducting.  Muse highlights include  Farah Nayeri  on film; and  Guy
Collins  and  John Mariani  on wine.  (Catherine Hickley writes for Muse, the arts and leisure
