China’s smallest oil imports from
West  Africa  in at least two years are curbing demand for tankers
on the third-longest trade route, prolonging the worst rates in
more than a decade for Frontline Ltd. and other owners.  Chinese refiners will buy 28 percent less West African
crude this month than a year earlier, the least in data starting
in August 2011, according to loading plans and a Bloomberg News
survey of eight traders. Shares of Frontline, which operates 32
very large crude carriers, will drop 38 percent in 12 months,
the average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg shows.
Those of Euronav SA, with 13 supertankers in its fleet, will
retreat 24 percent, the forecasts show.  Tanker owners are enduring a fifth year of declining rates
as fleet growth outpaces demand.  China ’s preference for cheaper
Middle East oil over West African supplies shortens voyages by
42 percent, effectively increasing the capacity of the fleet,
says ICAP Shipping International Ltd., a shipbroker in London.
That’s adding to changes in trade flows as the U.S., the only
country that buys more oil than China, meets the highest
proportion of its energy needs since 1986.  “Falling shipments point to potentially one more bad month
of earnings, which tanker owners could really do without,”
Simon Newman, the London-based head of tanker research at ICAP
Shipping, said by telephone on Aug. 28. “To avoid an even
weaker market, owners will need significant support from
shipments out of other areas.”  Annual Average  Daily earnings for VLCCs, each as long as three football
fields and able to hold 2 million barrels of crude, plunged 92
percent this year to $1,515 on Aug. 30, according to Clarkson
Plc, the biggest shipbroker. Rates averaged $7,397 since the
start of 2013, on course for the lowest annual level since at
least 1997. They peaked at $229,484 in December 2007.  Frontline, led by billionaire shipping investor John Fredriksen, says its ships need $25,000 a day to break even.
Shares of the company fell 20 percent to 14.75 kroner ($2.43) in
Oslo trading this year and will reach 9.18 kroner in 12 months,
according to the average of 14 analyst estimates compiled by
Bloomberg. Hamilton, Bermuda-based Frontline’s net loss will
widen to $144.7 million this year, the analysts predict.  The industry has about 75 too many VLCCs, equal to 13
percent of the fleet, and owners need to scrap more ships, Jens Martin Jensen, chief executive officer of Frontline’s management
unit, said on an Aug. 28 conference call. The company split in
two in December 2011 to avoid running out of cash and said last
week it may be unable to repay $225 million of convertible bonds
maturing in 2015 unless the market recovers or it sells shares
or assets, reiterating comments first made in February.  Chinese Buying  The bonds, which have a 4.5 percent coupon, last traded on
July 30 at 54 cents on the dollar, according to data from Trace,
the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority. The debt may be converted into equity at a
stock price of $36.5567 until the April 2015 due date, compared
with Frontline’s share price in New York of $2.42.  China will buy 702,833 barrels of West African crude a day
this month, compared with 973,917 a year earlier, the survey and
loading programs showed. Total Asian imports from  Angola  and
four other African nations will reach an 18-month low of 1.5
million barrels a day, the data show.  The voyage to China from West Africa takes about 34 days,
compared with 20 days from the Middle East, ICAP Shipping
estimates. The longest trade route for oil tankers is between
Venezuela and China, followed by vessels sailing between the
Middle East and U.S.  Seaborne Trade  Rising seaborne trade in crude may offset the shorter
distances. China bought a record 6.1 million barrels a day in
July, customs  data  show. VLCC shipments to Asia from the Middle
East will advance 7 percent to 8.1 million barrels a day this
year, London-based Clarkson estimates. China’s combined imports
by sea will rise 6 percent to 5.2 million barrels a day in 2013,
the shipbroker says.  Concern that unrest in the Middle East and North Africa
could disrupt oil supplies may prompt stockpiling, boosting
demand for imports, said  Harry Tchilinguirian , the head of
commodity markets at BNP Paribas SA in London. Protests in
Libya, once Africa’s third-largest producer, closed oil
terminals and cut output to less than half the 1.6 million
barrels pumped daily before the 2011 revolution.  Western nations are debating a military strike against
 Syria  in response to an alleged chemical-weapons attack. While
daily Syrian oil output averaged only 164,000 barrels last year,
the conflict may disrupt supply across the Middle East, which
produced an average of 28.3 million barrels, according to data
from BP Plc. The tensions could lead to higher tanker rates in
the fall, Jensen said on the conference call.  Capacity Gluts  Capacity gluts extend across the merchant fleet because
owners ordered too many ships before the global recession. The
ClarkSea Index, a measure of earnings for vessels spanning the
fleet, averaged $9,099 a day this year, the lowest annual figure
since at least 1990. The excess of VLCCs is the biggest since
1985, according to Fearnley Consultants A/S, part of the company
that also includes  Norway ’s second-biggest shipbroker.  Euronav, based in Antwerp,  Belgium , operates 23 Suezmaxes,
about half the size of VLCCs. Shares of the company dropped 9.4
percent to 4.16 euros ($5.47) in Brussels this year and will
reach 3.16 euros in 12 months, the analyst estimates show. It
will report an $85.1 million loss this year, from $85.9 million
in 2012, according to the mean of six estimates. Refineries in
Asia may be out of service for extended periods, curbing oil
demand, said Hugo de Stoop, Euronav’s chief financial officer.  “Refineries seem to be getting upgrades, which may mean
that downtime will be longer than in previous years,” he said
by phone Aug. 30. “The impact on the shipping market is all to
do with oversupply. There are just too many ships.”  Nippon Yusen  The largest publicly listed owners of supertankers are
 Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd. (9104)  and Nippon Yusen K.K., Clarkson data
show. Both companies, based in  Tokyo , also own container ships
and dry-bulk carriers. Mitsui O.S.K. shares will gain 3.1
percent to 419.50 yen ($4.22) in 12 months as Nippon Yusen rises
13 percent to 324.86 yen, according to the averages of 28
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  China is favoring Russian and Middle Eastern supply over
West Africa because of prices. West African oil is priced off
Brent, the North Sea benchmark, while Asian grades track Dubai
crude. The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps  rose  to $6.28 a barrel
on Aug. 30, the highest since October 2011, according to data
from PVM Oil Associates Ltd.  The U.S. is buying 12 percent less crude than a year ago as
domestic production rises to the highest since 1989, according
to Energy Department data. That compounds the effect on VLCC
owners because the ships typically take West African oil to
China on the return from a Middle East-to-U.S. journey, said Ole Stenhagen, an Oslo-based analyst at SEB Enskilda.  “It used to be that ships heading back to the Middle East
stopped by West Africa and took something to China,” said
Stenhagen, whose recommendations on the shares of shipping
companies returned 51 percent in the past three years. “With
the Middle East-to-U.S. route dying away, West Africa will have
to carry its own trade.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
