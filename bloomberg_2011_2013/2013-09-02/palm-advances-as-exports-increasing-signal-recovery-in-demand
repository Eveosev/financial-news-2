Palm oil  climbed, extending the
biggest monthly increase since 2010, as rising shipments from
Malaysia signaled a recovery in demand for the world’s most
consumed cooking oil.  Palm for November delivery added as much as 1.5 percent to
2,440 ringgit ($743) a metric ton on the Bursa Malaysia
Derivatives and ended the morning session at 2,437 ringgit. Palm
for physical delivery in September was at 2,450 ringgit on Aug.
30, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Exports from Malaysia climbed 6.5 percent to 1.5 million
tons in August from July, according to surveyor Intertek.
Futures rose 7.5 percent in August, the biggest monthly gain
since December 2010, as a weaker ringgit boosted shipments.  “Positive exports should keep inventories relatively flat
in the coming months,” said Arhnue Tan, an analyst with
Alliance Investment Bank Bhd. “For this month and next month,
there could be some festive pre-stocking from India. Prices are
still quite low, which could be a catalyst to buy earlier rather
than later.”  India, the biggest consumer, usually increases cooking oil
imports before the Diwali festival which occurs on Nov. 3 this
year. Malaysia’s  inventories  dropped 37 percent to 1.66 million
tons in July from a record in December.  Refined palm oil for January delivery climbed 1.3 percent
to 5,624  yuan  ($919) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange .
 Soybean oil  advanced 1.3 percent to 7,262 yuan a ton. The U.S
markets are closed today for the Labor Day holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
