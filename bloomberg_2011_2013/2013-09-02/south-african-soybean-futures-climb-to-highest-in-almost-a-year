South African soybean futures rose
to the highest level in almost a year in Johannesburg trading as
U.S. prices rallied for a fourth week.  Soy for delivery in December, the most active contract,
climbed 2 percent to 5,880 rand ($577) a metric ton by the
midday close on the South African Futures Exchange. That’s the
highest for a most active contract since Sept. 17 last year.  Soybeans futures for delivery in November climbed for a
fourth straight week in the five days through Aug. 30 on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The market was closed for a public
holiday today. Iowa, Illinois and  Indiana  were headed for the
driest August since 1897, according to T-Storm Weather. The rain
predicted for Sept. 9 may be too late for some crops hurt by
hot, dry weather last week,  World Weather Inc.  said in a report
on Aug. 30.  “The soybeans were planted a bit later than the maize and
the effect of a drier period would have a greater impact on the
supply of soy over that of corn,” Jacques Pretorius, a trader
at Suidwes Beherend Ltd., said by phone from Leeudoringstad in
the North West province. Corn is also known as maize in South
Africa.  White corn for delivery in December increased 0.7 percent
to 2,377 rand a ton while the yellow variety for delivery in the
same month gained 0.4 percent to 2,224 rand a ton.  South Africa  is the continent’s largest producer of corn.
Meal made from white corn is used as one of the nation’s staple
foods, while the yellow variety is mainly used as  animal feed .  To contact the reporter on this story:
