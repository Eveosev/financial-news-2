     Sept. 2 (Bloomberg) --The won climbed to the highest level
in more than three months after South  Korea  reported a  trade
surplus  that was double what economists predicted, boosting the
growth outlook.  Government bonds  declined.  Exports exceeded imports by $4.92 billion in August, the
Trade Ministry said yesterday, compared with the median forecast
of $2.3 billion in a Bloomberg survey of 10 economists. South
Korean shipbuilders reported orders for container vessels last
week. Foreign investors bought $1.9 billion more local stocks
than they sold in August, the biggest monthly net purchase since
December, exchange data show.  “The better-than-forecast trade surplus and the news of
shipbuilding contracts are lifting the sentiment on the won,”
said Jeon Seung Ji, a currency analyst at Samsung Futures Inc.
in Seoul. “It remains to be seen whether the trend of foreign
investors buying stocks will continue this month.”  The won advanced 0.9 percent, the most since Aug. 5, to
1,100.59 per dollar in Seoul, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The currency touched 1,100.53, the strongest level
since May 10. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, was
little changed at 7.96 percent.  Exports rose 7.7 percent in August from a year ago and
imports gained 0.8 percent, official data showed yesterday.
South Korea’s economy is expected to grow 2.8 percent this year
and second-half exports will probably increase 5 percent from a
year ago on shipbuilding, MoneyToday reported yesterday, citing
an interview with Vice Trade Minister Kim Jae Hong. The  Bank of
Korea  forecast in July Asia’s fourth-largest economy will expand
2.8 percent this year and 4 percent in 2014.  Exporters Orders  Samsung Heavy Industries Co. won contracts for a total 1.06
trillion won ($963 million) of two overseas deals and Samsung
Engineering Co. got 398.9 billion won order, the companies’
regulatory filings said today. Hyundai Heavy Industries Co. and
Daewoo Shipbuilding & Marine Engineering Co. won contracts
valued at 2 trillion won for  container ships , according to
regulatory filings last week.  The yield on South Korea’s 2.75 percent bonds due June 2016
climbed three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 2.91
percent, Korea Exchange Inc. prices show. South Korea sold 1.85
trillion won of three-year government notes at yield of 2.92
percent and 700 billion of 30-year securities at 3.89 percent
today.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  holds less South Korean assets than the
weighting in its benchmark on concern over a central bank battle
to curb  household debt  and a reduction in U.S. monetary
stimulus, according to Joel Kim, Singapore-based head of Asia-pacific fixed income at the world’s biggest money manager.  To contact the reporter on this story:
