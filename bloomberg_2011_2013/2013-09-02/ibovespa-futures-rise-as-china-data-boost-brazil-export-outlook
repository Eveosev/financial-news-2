The Ibovespa rose the most among
major global equity gauges as steelmaker  Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA (CSNA3)  led gains by commodity producers after manufacturing
strengthened in  China ,  Brazil ’s top trading partner.  Iron-ore producer Vale SA, whose top export market is the
Asian country, advanced to a one-week high. All 10 industry
groups on the MSCI Brazil Index rose. Brookfield Incorporacoes
SA jumped the most among real estate companies.  OGX Petroleo e
Gas Participacoes SA , the  oil company  controlled by  Eike Batista , rallied after posting a record plunge on Aug. 30.  The Ibovespa added 3.7 percent to 51,835.15 at the close of
trading in Sao Paulo, with 10 stocks gaining for each that fell.
It was the biggest one-day advance since July 27, 2012. The real
climbed 0.3 percent to 2.3774 per dollar. In China, an official
manufacturing gauge reached a 16-month high of 51 and a separate
measure from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics jumped the
most in three years to 50.1. Readings above 50 indicate
expansion.  “Most of the risk for a China slowdown is already priced
in,”  Nick Robinson , who manages about $15 billion of Latin
American shares as the head of Brazilian equities at Aberdeen
Asset Management Plc, said in a telephone interview from  Sao
Paulo . “China will probably keep growing at a pace that’s fast
enough to support commodities prices. The long-term outlook for
companies like Vale is very positive.”  Eased concern that a slowdown in China will sap commodities
and speculation that a weaker currency will boost Brazil’s
exports have fueled a rally in the Ibovespa, which has gained 15
percent since this year’s  low  on July 3.  OGX Rallies  The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index
rose 1.4 percent today. CSN jumped 5.3 percent to 8.87 reais,
and Vale added 3 percent to 32.02 reais.  OGX surged 33 percent to 40 centavos after tumbling 40
percent on Aug. 30. The stock’s  weighting  on the Ibovespa
increased to 4.26 percent today from 0.92 percent previously
after the rebalancing the exchange carries out every four
months, data compiled by Bloomberg show. It’s now the fourth-heaviest weighted member on the gauge, according to a statement
from BM&FBovespa.  Brookfield rose 7.6 percent to 1.83 reais, leading gains in
real estate stocks, as traders pared bets for higher borrowing
costs in Brazil amid eased concern that a weaker currency will
fuel inflation.  Brazilian swap rates, a gauge of expectations for interest-rate moves, fell on most contracts today. Rates on the contract
due in January 2015 retreated one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 10.52 reais.  Brazil GDP  The BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index advanced 3.5 percent. A
report last week from the national statistics agency showed
Brazil’s second-quarter gross domestic product expanded 1.5
percent, more than the 0.9 percent economists surveyed by
Bloomberg had projected.  The GDP report show “a surprisingly strong rebound in
Brazil,”  Michael Henderson , an economist at Capital Economics
Ltd., wrote in a note to clients today.  BRF SA (BRFS3) , the world’s largest meatpacker by market value,
rose 0.8 percent to 55.66 reais, the highest on a closing basis
in two weeks. The company said on Aug. 30 after markets closed
that it plans to buy back as many as 1.38 million shares in the
next 15 days.  The Ibovespa trades at 12.7 times analysts’ earnings
estimates for the next four quarters, compared with 10.5 for the
MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.
Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.8 billion
reais today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That
compares with a daily average of 7.75 billion reais this year
through Aug. 27, according to data  compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
