Georgian billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili said he’s “fully satisfied” with his performance
as prime minister as he prepares to step down after presidential
elections next month.  Ivanishvili will also resign as head of his coalition,
which beat President Mikheil Saakashvili’s party last October to
take control of the government, according to an open letter sent
today by e-mail. He said he’ll return to politics if required.  “I don’t have anything against Saakashvili personally but
my mission was to defeat the idea of a messiah,” Ivanishvili
said. He said in October 2011 that it would take two to three
years to nurture a multi-party political system, develop the
judiciary and influence foreign policy.  The 57-year-old tycoon, who made most of his fortune in
 Russia , is worth $6.4 billion, according to the Bloomberg
Billionaires Index, equal to about 40 percent of  Georgia ’s
economy. He campaigned on a promise to improve  living standards 
and remains committed to the previous government’s goal to join
NATO and the European Union.  To contact the reporter on this story:
