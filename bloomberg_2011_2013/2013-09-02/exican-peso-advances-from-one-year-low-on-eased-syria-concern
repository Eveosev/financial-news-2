Mexico ’s peso rose from a one-year
low as concern eased that a U.S. strike on Syria was imminent,
buoying emerging-market assets.  The currency appreciated 0.4 percent to 13.3324 per  U.S.
dollar  at 10:04 a.m. in Mexico City after falling on Aug. 30 to
13.38, the weakest level since August 2012. The peso tumbled 3.2
percent last week, the biggest decline among major currencies
tracked by Bloomberg. Yields on Mexico’s benchmark peso bonds
due in 2024 climbed four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point,
to 6.41 percent today, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Mexico’s peso rallied along with most developing-nation
currencies after President  Barack Obama  delayed potential
military action against Syria by seeking approval from Congress.  The peso dropped “quickly last week because of an
adjustment of positioning and Syria,”  Ramon Cordova , a trader
at Banco Base SA in San Pedro Garza Garcia, Mexico, said in an
e-mailed response to questions. “In Syria, the attack that was
expected didn’t happen.”  In Mexico, lawmakers started their second ordinary session
of the year and President Enrique Pena Nieto addressed the
nation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
