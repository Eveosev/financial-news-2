Tokyo is the odds-on favorite to
host the 2020  Olympic Games  in the days before the winning city
is announced, according to bookmakers.  Japan’s capital, which last hosted the Olympics in 1964,
has 44 percent of the bets placed, according to  OddsChecker.com ,
a website that gathers online gambling data. Madrid is second
with a 29 percent chance of winning the Summer Games, followed
by Istanbul with 24 percent. The speculation is giving a boost
to Japanese construction and real estate companies.  Okasan Securities Group Inc.’s Tokyo Olympics-Related
Stocks Index has gained 47 percent this year, compared with the
broader Topix Index that has added 34 percent. The group of 79
stocks that may benefit from the Games includes real estate,
tourist companies and construction firms such as  Yokogawa Bridge
Holdings Corp. (5911) , which jumped 61 percent this year.  “Development-related stocks in the index have appreciated
significantly because of the Olympics,” said Takashi Kusaki,
deputy director at Okasan’s Global Financial Investigation
Department in Tokyo. “The rise is likely to expand to tourism
and other consumer-related industries later.”  Consumer-electronics makers, including  Sony Corp. (6758)  and
 Panasonic Corp. (6752) , may benefit from supplying big screens to
stadiums, bars and sports fans. Sony has doubled this year and
Panasonic has gained 76 percent.  Seiko Epson Corp. (6724) , maker of the
timekeepers often seen at the finish lines of track-and-field
races, also has doubled.  “High-end TV sets and cameras are likely to be bought as
the Games approach,” Kusaki said.  Disneyland Park  The Tokyo 2020 Bid Committee estimated in June last year
that the economic effect from the Olympic Games would be
approximately 3 trillion yen ($30.2 billion) for Japan,
according the group’s  website . The Games can create more than
150,000 jobs, according to the estimate.  The  International Olympic Committee  will announce the
winning city Sept. 7 in  Buenos Aires .  Tokyo is planning its biggest housing complex in 42 years
to lodge athletes, Kenichi Kimura, who is in charge of the
finances for the city’s bid at the Tokyo Metropolitan
Government, said earlier this year. The government separately
plans to spend 153.8 billion yen for new construction and
renovations at 11 sites, he said at the time.  The village is planned on an area 28 percent larger than
Disneyland Park in California and would be Tokyo’s biggest since
1971, when a residential project called Tama New Town was built
on the western outskirts of the capital, according to Deutsche
Bank AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
