Waertsilae Oyj (WRT1V) , a Finnish maker of
ship engines, rose the most in eight weeks in Helsinki trading
after winning a repeat-order for the design and engines of a
dual-fuel platform supply vessel.  Waertsilae increased as much as 3 percent to 36.38 euros,
the steepest intraday advance since July 8, and added 2.9
percent to 36.36 euros at 1:50 p.m. in the Finnish capital.
Trading volume was 29 percent of the three-month daily average.  Waertsilae will design a platform supply vessel for  Siem
Offshore Inc. (SIOFF) , the Finnish company said in a statement today.
The order includes supplying dual-fuel engines that also run on
liquefied natural gas, the ship’s electrical and automation
systems and its LNG storage and handling systems. Waertsilae
didn’t disclose the value of the order for the vessel, which
will be operational in 2015.  Ship-power solutions make up about 25 percent of
Waertsilae’s 1.15 billion-euro ($1.5 billion) second-quarter net
sales, with power plants and services accounting for the rest.
The attractiveness of LNG as a fuel is supported by its low
carbon-intensity, global trade and pricing, Waertsilae said in
the interim report on July 18.  Siem Offshore made a similar order in November 2012 and
almost half of the vessels in its fleet already feature
Waertsilae ship designs and equipment, the Helsinki-based
company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
