Commonwealth Bank of Australia , the
country’s largest lender by market value, said its head of
institutional banking and markets, Ian Saines, will leave at the
end of 2013 and it will begin a global search to replace him.  Saines joined CBA in 2004 and was promoted to head the
institutional banking and markets unit in March 2009. CBA did
not specify Saines’ next role in today’s statement.  Saines, 51, is the second senior executive to leave CBA
since Ian Narev became chief executive officer in December 2011.
Ross McEwan, 56, quit as CBA’s head of retail banking in May
2012 to become CEO of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc  Aug. 2.  CBA’s institutional and markets business contributed 16
percent of CBA’s cash profit in the year ended June 30, company
filings show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
