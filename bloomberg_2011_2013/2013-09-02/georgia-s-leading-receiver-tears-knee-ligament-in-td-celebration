University of Georgia  leading
receiver Malcolm Mitchell will miss the rest of the college
football season after tearing a ligament in his right knee while
celebrating the team’s first touchdown.  Mitchell, a junior, was injured when he landed awkwardly
after leaping into the air following a 75-yard touchdown run by
Todd Gurley in the first quarter of fifth-ranked  Georgia ’s 38-35
season-opening loss to Clemson two days ago.  “In the exuberance of the first touchdown of the game when
he went to congratulate his teammate and they chest-bumped, he
just landed in a bad way,” Georgia coach Mark Richt said on the
team’s website. “That’s when we knew something had happened.”  Richt said tests revealed a torn anterior cruciate ligament
for Mitchell, who had 40 catches for 572 yards and four
touchdowns last season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
