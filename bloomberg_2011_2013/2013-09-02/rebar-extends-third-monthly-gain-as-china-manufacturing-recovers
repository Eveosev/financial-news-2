Steel reinforcement-bar futures rose
in  Shanghai , extending a third straight monthly gain, after
gauges of manufacturing for  China  improved.  Rebar for January delivery rose as much as 0.9 percent to
3,786 yuan ($619) a metric ton on Shanghai Futures Exchange, and
traded 3,783 yuan a ton at 10:07 a.m. local time. Futures rose 3
percent last month, paring this year’s drop to 5 percent.  The Purchasing Managers’ Index was at 51.0, the highest in
16 months, data by the National Bureau of Statistics and China
Federation of Logistics and Purchasing showed yesterday. A
separate manufacturing PMI released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics rose to 50.1 last month from 47.7 in July,
the biggest gain in three years.  “The stronger PMI provided a boost to rebar today,” said
Ren Xinlei, an analyst at Luzheng Futures Co. in Jinan. “The
physical market is quite bullish, which looks to last through
the next quarter.”  Rebar inventory  fell 0.4 percent to 6.59 million tons in
the week through Aug. 30, the lowest level since Jan. 25,
according to Shanghai Steelhome Information Technology Co.  The average  spot price  of rebar fell 0.2 percent to 3,598
 yuan  a ton Aug. 30, according to Beijing Antaike Information
Development Co.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin port
fell 0.4 percent to $137.70 a dry ton on the same day, according
to a price index compiled by The Steel Index Ltd.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
