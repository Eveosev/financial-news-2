Gold was little changed in London,
after reaching a one-week low, as prospects for an imminent
attack against Syria receded. Silver rose for the first time in
four days.  Gold reached a three-month high of $1,433.83 an ounce on
Aug. 28, helping prices climb for a second straight month, amid
concern the U.S. will take military action against Syria. U.S.
President  Barack Obama  said on Aug. 31 he will ask members of
Congress to back his plan for a military strike on Syria.  The metal slid 17 percent this year as some investors lost
faith in gold as a store of value and on speculation the Federal
Reserve will slow stimulus. Gold rebounded from a 34-month low
of $1,180.50 in June as lower prices boosted demand for jewelry,
bars and coins in Asia. Hedge funds and other large speculators
are the most bullish since January and sales from bullion-backed
exchange-traded products last month were the least this year.  “Uncertainty on whether or not military action will be
taken against Syria has taken off some of gold’s safe-haven
bid,” Joni Teves, an analyst at UBS AG in  London , wrote today
in an e-mailed report. “The recent move in gold positioning
clearly indicates further reluctance to be short. On the
physical front, activity has been quiet of late, as can be
expected given elevated price levels.”  Gold for immediate delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,392.09
an ounce by 5:09 p.m. in London, rebounding from as low as
$1,373.38, the lowest since Aug. 23. It gained as much as 0.2
percent to $1,398.33. Bullion for December delivery slipped 0.3
percent to $1,391.80 on the Comex in New York.  U.S. Holiday  U.S. markets are closed today for the Labor Day holiday.
Futures trading volume was 61 percent below the average for the
past 100 days for this time of day, data compiled by Bloomberg
showed. Bullion at the afternoon “fixing,” used by some mining
companies to sell output, was at $1,392.25 in London, up from
$1,391.25 this morning.  Money managers boosted their net-long position, or bets on
higher prices, by 34 percent in the week to Aug. 27, as holdings
of short contracts slid 37 percent, U.S. Commodity Futures
Trading Commission data show. Gold-backed ETP holdings rose
during the past three weeks, increasing 7.8 metric tons from a
three-year low of 1,946.9 tons on Aug. 8, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  U.S. Congressional leaders have agreed to debate military
action against  Syria  once lawmakers return from their recess on
Sept. 9. Britain’s parliament last week rejected a proposed
strike.  Silver Climbs  An official Purchasing Managers’ Index jumped more than
estimated to a 16-month high, a Chinese government report showed
yesterday. A separate PMI released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics rose to 50.1 last month from 47.7 in July,
the largest gain since 2010. Readings above 50 signal expansion.  Silver for immediate delivery climbed 2.9 percent to
$24.2045 an ounce in London, after rallying 18 percent in
August, the biggest monthly gain since January 2012. Platinum
was little changed at $1,522.75 an ounce. Palladium was 1
percent lower at $715.20 an ounce.  Anglo American Platinum Ltd. (AMS)  will fire about 3,300 workers,
and others will be redeployed or voluntarily quit, as the
biggest producer seeks to revive profitability, it said Aug. 30.
South Africa’s National Union of Mineworkers, which represents
about 64 percent of gold miners in the country, will start a
strike over pay from Sept. 3, the Chamber of Mines said on Aug.
30.  To contact the reporters on this story:
