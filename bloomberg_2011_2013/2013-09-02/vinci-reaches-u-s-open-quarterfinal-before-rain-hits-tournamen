American Alison Riske was eliminated
in the fourth round of the  U.S. Open  today by Slovakia’s Daniela
Hantuchova as rain caused a 4 1/2-hour delay at the season’s
final Grand Slam tennis tournament.  Italians Roberta Vinci and Flavia Pennetta joined
Hantuchova in the quarterfinals. The final women’s fourth-round
match, between No. 2 seed Victoria Azarenka of Belarus and No.
13 Ana Ivanovic of Serbia was postponed until tomorrow.  Hantuchova, 30, reached the U.S. Open quarterfinals for the
first time since 2002 with a 6-3, 5-7, 6-2 defeat of Riske, a
wild-card entrant who is ranked 81st in the world and was
invited to play the event after failing to qualify on her own.  The Hantuchova-Riske match was interrupted by rain with the
score tied 4-4 in the second set. After Riske won that set,
Hantuchova had five of her 15 aces in the final set to wrap up
the victory.  Vinci, seeded 10th, made a total of nine unforced errors as
she defeated fellow Italian Camila Giorgi 6-4, 6-2 in 67 minutes
and moved on to play yet another compatriot, Pennetta.  Pennetta won 6-2, 7-6 (7-3) against No. 21 Simona Halep of
Romania in another match that was interrupted for 4 1/2 hours by
rain. Pennetta trailed 5-4 in the second set when heavy rain
sent the players scurrying off court.  The  National Weather Service  said there was a 60 percent
chance of more showers and possibly a thunderstorm this evening,
with some of the storms producing heavy rain.  Five-time champion and No. 7 seed  Roger Federer  of
Switzerland was playing 19th-seeded Tommy Robredo of Spain today
as the men began fourth-round matches. Fourth-seeded  David Ferrer  of Spain was facing No. 18 Janko Tipsarevic of Serbia.  Weather permitting tonight,  Rafael Nadal , the No. 2 seed
from Spain, is set to play No. 22 Philipp Kohlschreiber of
Germany, and No. 8  Richard Gasquet  of France is scheduled to
take on 10th-seeded Milos Raonic of Canada.  To contact the reporter on this story:
