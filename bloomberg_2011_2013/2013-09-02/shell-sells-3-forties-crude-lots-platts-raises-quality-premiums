Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  sold three
cargoes of Forties crude at 45 cents to 95 cents a barrel above
Dated Brent. There were no trades of Russian Urals blend.  Platts raised the quality premium for Oseberg and Ekofisk
crudes for loading in October to 65.52 cents a barrel and 56.19
cents respectively, the pricing agency said in a note on its
website today. That compares with premiums of 49.21 cents for
Oseberg and 40.95 cents for Ekofisk in September.  North Sea  Shell sold F0913 for loading on Sept. 23 to Sept. 25 at 95
cents above Dated Brent to Glencore Xstrata Plc, according to a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window.  Europe’s largest oil company also sold lot F0907 for Sept.
13 to Sept. 15 at a premium of 55 cents to Dated Brent to
Statoil ASA. Shell sold F0906 for Sept. 14 to Sept. 16 to BP Plc
at plus 45 cents.  The deals were the first trades in the window since Aug.
18, the survey showed.  Four other bids for Forties in the window were unsold,
according to the survey. BP for a Sept. 23 to Sept. 25 shipment
at 55 cents above Brent. Mercuria Energy Trading SA Sept. 20 to
Sept. 23 and Sept. 24 to Sept. 27 cargoes at plus 70 cents.
Gunvor Group for Sept. 23 to Sept. 26 lot at 85 cents.  Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time.  Brent for October settlement traded at $113.90 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $114.81 in the previous session. The November
contract was at $112.10, a discount of $1.80 to October.  Maintenance work at the Dunlin Alpha production facility
was deferred by five weeks and will now start Sept. 29, John
Wiseman, general manager of Fairfield Energy Plc’s Dunlin Area,
said today in an e-mailed response to questions. The delay is a
result of an “unprecedented period of high pressure over the
northern North Sea which caused major disruptions to flights”
resulting in necessary pre-shutdown work falling behind
schedule, he said.  Work at the Dunlin Area was originally schedule to begin
Aug. 25. It will take about 12,000 barrels a day offline for 45
days. Crude from the facility flows into the Brent stream.  Abu Dhabi National Energy Co.’s Eider and North Cormorant
platforms were shut for planned maintenance on Aug. 27 and Aug
31, respectively, an official said today in an e-mailed response
to questions, asking not to be identified citing company policy.
The fields produce approximately 11,000 barrels a day according
to data from the Department of Energy and Climate Change. Crude
production, which feeds into the Brent blend, will resume in
early October.  The “Skarv FPSO will shut for about 2 weeks on Sept. 7 to
take advantage of the Kaarstoe shutdown,” Jan Erik Geirmo, a
Stavanger, Norway-based spokesman for BP said today in response
to e-mailed questions. The Kaarstoe processing facility will be
partly shut from Sept. 1 to Sept. 17 for planned maintenance.  Maintenance work will include pressure-vessel inspections
and the recertification of pressure safety valves. The halt will
take about 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day offline.  “Maersk Oil has a planned shutdown on GPIII, the FPSO
which Dumbarton is producing via. Shutdowns like this are common
in the summer due to maintenance work,”  Charlotte  Holst Hansen,
a Copenhagen-based spokeswoman, said today in e-mailed response
to questions.  The Dumbarton and Lochranza fields feed about 20,000
barrels of oil equivalent a day, according to the company’s
website, while approximately 4,000 barrels a day of crude flows
from the Balloch field, data from the Department of Energy and
Climate Change shows. “Everything is according to plan,”
Hansen added, without specifying when work began and due to end.  Urals/Mediterranean  Shell withdrew an offer to sell Urals crude for Sept. 15 to
Sept. 19 loading at 70 cents a barrel below Dated Brent on a
delivered basis to Rotterdam.  Russian oil flows to the Baltic port of Novorossiysk were
halted yesterday and may resume Sept. 4, Igor Dyomin, a
spokesman for pipeline operator OAO Transneft, said by phone
from Moscow.  Libya is exporting a “nominal quantity” of crude from the
Brega and Mellitah terminals, Deputy Oil Minister Oman Shakmak
said in a telephone interview from Libya. The nation is
producing less than 300,000 barrels a day of crude, the minister
added, compared with a post-revolution peak  of 1.6 million
barrels a day.  Iraq  has resumed exports to the Turkish port of Ceyhan,
pumping at a daily rate of 325,000 barrels, according to a
statement from the country’s state-owned North Oil Co. Iraq
halted crude shipments for a few hours at dawn today on  Turkey ’s
requests because of storage tanks being full.  West Africa  BP is working to resume shipments of Saturno crude from its
PSVM project in Angola today or tomorrow, a company spokesman
said. Output was more than 50,000 barrels a day yesterday, Paulo
Pizarro, the Luanda-based official, said by e-mail. “We are
resuming loading, not sure if today or tomorrow, and we are
already increasing our production rate,” Pizarro said.  Production was halted and a force majeure declared on Aug.
18 when a mooring hawser failed in the offshore production area
of Block 31. The PSVM development was pumping about 130,000
barrels a day and on its way to 150,000 barrels by year’s end
when the incident occurred, Pizarro said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
