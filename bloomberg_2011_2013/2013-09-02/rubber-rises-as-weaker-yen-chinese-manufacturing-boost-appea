Rubber futures in  Tokyo  extended
gains from the biggest monthly advance since December as a
weaker Japanese currency and stronger-than-expected Chinese
manufacturing data increased demand for the yen-denominated
commodity used in tires.  Rubber for delivery in February on the Tokyo Commodity
Exchange rose as much as 2.2 percent to 274.9 yen a kilogram
($2,790 a metric ton), before trading at 273.5 yen at 12:10 p.m.
local time. Futures gained 12 percent and entered a  bull market 
in August, paring this year’s loss to 9.4 percent.  The yen weakened against most of its major peers as
speculators added to bearish bets as Prime Minister Shinzo Abe
got backing for a sales tax increase from a consultative panel
that urged stimulus to cushion the economic blow.  China’s
economy  is strengthening after a two-quarter slowdown, with a
manufacturing gauge rising to a 16-month high in August.  “China’s PMI brings a positive impact on a risky asset and
we expect that Chinese rubber demand will start to increase,”
said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research company Market Risk
Advisory Co. in Tokyo.  Futures for January delivery rose 2.9 percent to 20,585
 yuan  ($3,364) a ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange. Thai
rubber free-on-board was unchanged at 84.65 baht ($2.64) a
kilogram on Aug. 30, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of Thailand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
