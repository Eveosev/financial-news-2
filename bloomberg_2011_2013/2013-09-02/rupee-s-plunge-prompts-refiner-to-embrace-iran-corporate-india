India  is increasing imports of crude
oil from  Iran  as policy makers risk flouting U.S. trade
sanctions in their scramble to halt the slump in the rupee.  Mangalore Refinery & Petrochemicals Ltd. (MRPL) , India’s biggest
buyer of Iranian crude, plans to buy five cargoes of 85,000
metric tons each this month, compared with three in August,
Managing Director P.P. Upadhya said in an interview. Shipments
from the world’s only producer that accepts rupee payments for
oil are estimated to rise to 4 million tons in the year ending
March 31, versus 3.9 million tons in the previous 12 months.  India is among a few countries eligible for a waiver of a
U.S. law that imposes financial sanctions unless they can show
they have “significantly reduced” purchases from the Persian
Gulf country. Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  is seeking options
to revive the $1.8 trillion economy, which relies on imports to
meet 80 percent of its energy needs, as he struggles to stem
capital outflows that have weakened the rupee by 19 percent this
year against the dollar.  “Importing crude oil from Iran is crucial as it helps in
curbing dollar outgo in a big way,” Upadhya said by phone from
Mangalore on India’s west coast. “We can make part payment in
rupees. That’s the arrangement.”  Atomic Research  The U.S. and European Union are seeking to curb trade in
Iranian oil, arguing the Persian Gulf state’s atomic research is
aimed at producing weapons. The government in Tehran says it is
for civilian purposes. Asian customers of Iran, including  China ,
India and  South Korea , won waivers from the U.S. allowing
imports of Iranian crude as they were able to show purchases had
been curbed.  While India has abided by several rounds of United Nations
sanctions on Iran over the country’s nuclear program, it has
publicly criticized unilateral American sanctions as an
infringement on its sovereignty. Finance Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram told reporters last month that India is considering
stepping up imports without breaching UN rules.  Indian refiners buying Iranian crude deposit at least 45
percent of their payments in rupees into a bank account, former
junior oil minister R.P.N. Singh said in August last year. Iran
in return paid for imports of commodities including rice from
India in rupees. The nations also briefly traded in euros after
the  Reserve Bank  of India dismantled a mechanism used to settle
payments in dollars in December 2010.  Currency Benefit  “Buying more crude from Iran is positive for Indian
refiners like Mangalore Refinery due to currency benefit and
lower freight cost,” said Kamlesh Kotak, head of research at
Asian Markets Securities Pvt. Ltd. “This would be a short term
benefit, and the government needs a structured policy to handle
the current-account deficit better.”  South Korea imported 815,447 tons of Iranian crude in July,
38 percent higher than a year earlier, Korea Customs Service
said on its website Aug. 15. China’s imports in the month fell
13 percent to 1.69 million tons, according to data from General
Administration of Customs in Beijing.  Curbs on buyers have made Iran the sixth-biggest producer
in the  Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries , dropping
from the No. 2 position. The nation has the capacity to produce
3.5 million barrels per day, almost equivalent to India’s total
import requirement. Output rose 0.4 percent in August to 2.57
million barrels a day from the previous month.  Halted Purchases  Mangalore Refinery and  Hindustan Petroleum Corp. (HPCL) , the
nation’s third-biggest state refiner, and  Chennai Petroleum Corp. (MRL) 
halted crude purchases from Iran in April after Indian insurers
declined coverage. India’s government is preparing a 20 billion-rupee insurance fund for future purchases, Financial Services
Secretary Rajiv Takru said Aug. 19.  “If the government wants us to import Iran crude, we can
do so, since we have processed this crude in the past,” A.S.
Basu, managing director at Chennai Petroleum, a unit of Indian
Oil Corp., said in a Sept. 2 phone interview. “How much volume
we might actually take this year will depend on what price is
being offered.”  Iran’s Naftiran Intertrade Co.  owns  15.4 percent of Chennai
Petroleum, making it the second-biggest holder, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  In the absence of Iranian oil, refiners would need to buy
crude from the  spot market  which is typically more expensive.
Mangalore Refinery reported a  loss  of 4.5 billion rupees ($68
million) in the three months ended June 30, its third
consecutive quarter of losses. Raw material costs rose 6.8
percent to 144.1 billion rupees compared with a year earlier.  Shares Drop  Mangalore Refinery’s dropped 1.4 percent to 30.90 rupees in
Mumbai trading today.  The stock  has dropped 49 percent this year,
heading for its worst annual performance since 2008. Chennai
Petroleum has slumped 57 percent since January and Hindustan
Petroleum has slid 43 percent, compared with a 6.1 percent
decline in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  index.  Oil imports have contributed to India’s widening current-account deficit, which in turn is undermining efforts to revive
economic growth from its slowest pace in a decade.  Gross
domestic product  rose 5 percent in the year to March 31, the
smallest gain since 2003, while the rupee plunged to an all-time
low of 68.845 a dollar on Aug. 28.  India imported about 7.2 percent of its crude from Iran in
the past fiscal year, down from about 11 percent in the previous
12-month period, according to the oil ministry.  “If India is able to adjust oil imports from Iran against
exports using the Indian currency, it will squeeze our dollar
demand significantly,” said Chokkalingam G., the chief
investment officer at Centrum Wealth Management Ltd. in Mumbai,
which manages the equivalent of about $290 million in Indian
stocks. “It will make a big difference to India’s exchange rate
management and at the same time push up export of commodities.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
