AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  said toxic
waste it spilled last week affected 1.6 kilometers (1 mile) of a
tributary of  South Africa ’s Vaal River in at least the second
leak from its Mine Waste Solutions unit in the past five months.  “We appointed a response team, which included internal and
third-party specialists, to closely monitor and mitigate the
impact,” Africa’s largest gold producer said today by e-mail.
“Operations were immediately halted, containment walls
constructed, and all bolts in the critical sections of the
pipelines replaced and welded.”  The leak into the Koekemoer Spruit tributary, about 160
kilometers southwest of Johannesburg, is in the same area as
toxic waste spill at Hartebeestfontein in April.  AngloGold bought MWS last year for $335 million from First
Uranium Corp. as it sought to increase the amount of gold and
uranium it recovers from mine waste. The company, which operates
in 10 countries, was responsible for 15 environmental incidents
it classified as “significant” in 2012, with seven related to
MWS in South Africa, according to last year’s  annual report .  The company is still investigating the content of the toxic
waste leak into Koekemoer Spruit on Aug. 27, AngloGold said. The
pollutants “could be detrimental to flora and fauna but not to
human life,” company spokesman  Alan Fine  said on Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
