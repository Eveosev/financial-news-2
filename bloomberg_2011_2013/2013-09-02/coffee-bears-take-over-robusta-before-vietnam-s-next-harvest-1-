Money managers  turned bearish  on
robusta coffee traded in London in the latest week as  Vietnam ,
the world’s biggest producer of the variety, is set to harvest a
record crop in the coming season.  Investors had a net-short position, or bet on lower robusta
prices, of 2,431 futures and options for the week ended Aug. 27,
the Commitments of Traders report published today on the NYSE
Liffe exchange’s  website  showed. That reversed a net-long
position of 1,191 contracts in the prior period. The beans used
to make instant coffee fell 4.2 percent in the week ended Aug.
27.  Vietnam’s robusta crop probably will rise 17 percent to a
record 1.7 million metric tons in the 2013-14 season starting
Oct. 1, the median of nine estimates from local traders and
shippers compiled by Bloomberg last month showed. That implies a
harvest of 28.3 million bags, each weighing 60 kilograms (132
pounds). Volcafe, a unit of commodities trader ED&F Man Holdings
Ltd., on Aug. 30 predicted a 30 million-bag crop.  In cocoa, money managers’  net-long position  fell to 54,310
futures and options from 54,382 contracts a week earlier. The
beans used to make chocolate slid 1.9 percent in the period as
rains were forecast to return to West Africa, the world’s
biggest grower, potentially easing dryness that had threatened
to reduce the next crop.  In white, or refined, sugar, money managers’  net-long
position  rose to 11,504 futures and options from 11,218 lots a
week earlier. The sweetener fell 1.9 percent in the period.  In feed wheat, money managers increased their net-short
position to 623 contracts from 493 lots a week earlier. The
grain advanced 4.7 percent in the period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
