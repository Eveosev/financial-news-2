Fotowatio Renewable Ventures BV, a
European solar developer, won financing from  Australia and New
Zealand Banking Group Ltd.  and  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  for
a 20-megawatt photovoltaic plant in the country.  The banks will provide  project financing  for the Royalla
plant near Canberra in the Australian Capital Territory, FRV
said in an e-mailed statement without giving financial details.  The solar plant, one of the largest planned for Australia,
will receive a so-called feed-in tariff for 20 years from the
territoryâ€™s government and is scheduled to be completed by the
middle of next year by Spanish contractor  Acciona SA. (ANA)   The developer, controlled by U.S. investor Denham Capital
Management LP since last year, has developed solar projects with
more than 350 megawatts and operates plants in Spain and Italy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
