The  Swiss National Bank (SNBN) ’s ceiling on
the franc will stay in place as long as it is needed, according
to Vice President Jean-Pierre Danthine.  “The cap isn’t there forever -- it is there as long as it
corresponds to monetary conditions,” Danthine said late
yesterday at a business reception in Lausanne,  Switzerland .  Danthine’s comment comes after SNB President Thomas Jordan
said in a newspaper interview yesterday that there was no reason
to give up the ceiling on the Swiss currency. The central bank
imposed the cap of 1.20 per euro on the franc in September 2011,
citing the need to ward off deflation and a recession.  Danthine said that the cap’s strength against the euro in
2011 justified introducing the ceiling.  “Inflation is basically zero,” Danthine also said. Swiss
consumer prices ended 21 months of declines in July.  The central bank, which has held the benchmark rate at zero
since August 2011, won’t raise them this year or next, according
the the median estimate of economists in Bloomberg’s most recent
monthly economic survey published Aug. 9.  Swiss house and apartment prices have  soared  in recent
years, with mortgages kept cheap by the SNB’s loose policy. The
SNB has repeatedly warned of overheating, and the government is
requiring banks to hold more capital as of Sept. 30 as a buffer,
to guard against rising defaults.  To contact the reporter on this story:
