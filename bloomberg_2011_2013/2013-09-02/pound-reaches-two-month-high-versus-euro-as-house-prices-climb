The pound rose to the strongest
level versus the euro in two months after an index of U.K.
manufacturing expanded to the most since February 2011, adding
to signs the economy is recovering.  Gilts fell, pushing 10-year  yields  to the highest in more
than two years, as the gauge, based on a survey of  purchasing
managers , damped demand for the safety of government debt.
Sterling rose for the first time in five days against the dollar
before the  Bank of England  meets this week. The central bank
will keep its asset-purchase program and benchmark interest rate
unchanged, according to economists surveyed by Bloomberg, as
policy makers assess the impact of forward guidance.  “The U.K. PMI is another piece of good news for the
pound,” said  Peter Frank , global head of currency strategy at
 Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA (BBVA)  in  London . “It’s another
piece of evidence to suggest the recovery in the U.K. economy is
broad-based. Almost every data set has been quite good over the
past two months.”  The pound appreciated 0.5 percent to 84.76 pence per euro
at 4:37 p.m. London time after reaching 84.72 pence, the
strongest level since June 26. Sterling rose 0.2 percent to
$1.5536.  The measure of  manufacturing output  rose to 57.2 in August
from 54.8 a month earlier, Markit Economics and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said today. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was for a reading
of 55. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Home Values  A separate report showed average  house values  in  England 
and  Wales  rose 0.4 percent after a 0.3 percent gain in July,
London-based property researcher Hometrack said. Prices were up
1.8 percent from a year earlier, the most since July 2010.  The Engineering Employers’ Federation raised its forecasts
for U.K. economic growth and manufacturing output.  The Bank of England’s nine-member Monetary Policy Committee
will keep its bond-buying stimulus  program  at 375 billion pounds
on Sept. 5, according to all 38 economists in a Bloomberg
survey. Officials will also hold the main  interest rate  at a
record-low 0.5 percent, a separate survey showed.  The pound’s advance took it beyond its 200-day moving
average at 84.81 pence euro for the first time since December,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Sterling gained versus the dollar as Verizon Communications
Inc. said it is is poised to announce an agreement as soon as
today to acquire  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD) ’s 45 percent stake in their
wireless venture for $130 billion, capping its decade-long
pursuit of full control of the biggest U.S. mobile-phone
company.  Verizon Deal  The price will be paid in a combination of cash and
Verizon’s stock, Newbury, England-based Vodafone said in a
statement, describing the talks as “advanced.”  Sterling strengthened 6.5 percent in the past six months,
the best performer among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked
by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro gained 4.2
percent and the dollar climbed 2.7 percent.  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields climbed seven basis points,
or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.85 percent after reaching 2.87
percent, the highest since Aug. 1, 2011. The 2.25 percent bond
maturing in September 2023 fell 0.61, or 6.10 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 94.85.  Yields on 10-year gilts have risen about 40 basis points
since Bank of England Governor  Mark Carney  introduced forward
guidance last month. Carney said Aug. 7 the MPC won’t consider
raising its key rate until unemployment falls to 7 percent,
something it doesn’t see happening until the end of 2016.  Yields Climb  Investors have indicated skepticism about that projection
and added to bets on an increase before then, prompting Carney
to say officials are ready to add stimulus if expectations for
higher rates hurt the recovery.  The implied yield on the short-sterling contract expiring
in September 2016 rose nine basis points to 2.18 percent, from
as low as 1.53 percent on Aug. 1.  “We think it is unlikely that the BOE will be able to hold
off on an  interest-rate  hike until the late 2016 date that Mark
Carney has signaled,” Rob Wood, chief U.K. economist at
Berenberg Bank in London wrote in a note to clients. “The
economy appears to be running way ahead” of the central bank’s
growth forecast, “which should strengthen the view of those MPC
members that thought a first rate hike in late 2015 would be
reasonable,” Wood wrote.  The  Office for National Statistics  said on Aug. 23 the U.K.
economy expanded 0.7 percent in the second quarter. That
compared with an initial estimate of 0.6 percent published on
July 25.  Gilts lost 3.7 percent this year through Aug. 30, according
to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. German bonds dropped 2.2
percent and Treasuries declined 3.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
