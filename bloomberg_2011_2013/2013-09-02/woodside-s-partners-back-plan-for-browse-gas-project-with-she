Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s
second-largest oil producer, said its partners in the Browse
project support a plan to use  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s floating
liquefied natural gas technology.  Woodside expects to consider starting engineering and
design work on the LNG venture in 2014, the Perth-based company
said today in a statement. PetroChina Co.,  BP Plc (BP/) , Shell, Mitsui
& Co. and  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  are partners.  The offshore option will cost an estimated $46 billion over
the life of the Browse project, compared with about $70 billion
for an onshore development on the coast of  Western Australia ,
 Mark Greenwood , a Sydney-based analyst at Citigroup Inc., said
today by phone.  Woodside in April scrapped a plan to send gas from three
fields off the Western Australia coast to an onshore processing
plant because it was too expensive. The company expects that
processing the gas on a giant ship will be 35 percent to 50
percent cheaper and plans to decide in mid-2015 whether to go
ahead with the project, Woodside said last month.  The Hague-based Shell is also developing the Prelude
floating LNG project off Australia, which is due to start in
about 2017.  To contact the reporter on this story:
