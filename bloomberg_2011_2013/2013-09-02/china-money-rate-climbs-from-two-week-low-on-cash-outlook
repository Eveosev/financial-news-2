China ’s benchmark money-market rate
climbed from near a two-week low on speculation cash supply will
decline as banks hoard cash to meet reserve requirements.  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of funding availability in
the banking system, increased before the central and local
governments sells as much as 82.2 billion yuan ($13 billion) of
debt this week. The People’s Bank of China gauged demand for
seven- and 14-day reverse-repurchase agreements as well as 28-day repurchase contracts, according to a trader at a primary
dealer required to bid at the auctions.  “As usual, banks need to meet the reserve requirements on
the 5th every month, posing challenges to liquidity, but the
reverse-repo operations should help cap the gains,” said Cheng Qingsheng, an analyst at Evergrowing Bank Co. in  Shanghai .  The  seven-day repo rate , a gauge of funding availability in
the banking system, rose as much as seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, to 3.80 percent, a weighted average compiled
by the National Interbank Funding Center showed. It touched 3.69
percent on Aug. 30, the lowest since Aug. 13. The rate was up
two basis points to 3.75 percent as of 10:52 a.m. in Shanghai.  The cost of one-year  interest-rate swaps , the fixed payment
to receive the floating seven-day repo rate, rose one basis
point to 4.14 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index was at a 16-month high of 51.0 in August, according to data released
yesterday by the statistics bureau. A separate reading issued by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today was at 50.1, versus
47.7 in July, recording the biggest gain in three years.  Government Bonds  The yield on the government’s 4.08 percent bonds due August
2023 added one basis point to 4.07 percent, according to prices
from the Interbank Funding Center.  “Improving economic data and the large amount of new
issuance this week will probably drive government bond yields
higher,” Cheng said.  The Ministry of Finance will sell a total of 26 billion
 yuan  three-year bonds on behalf of four provinces and one
municipality today. It will also issue 30 billion yuan of three-year notes on Sept. 4, and 15 billion yuan 182-day bills. The
Municipality of Shanghai will issue 11.2 billion yuan of five-and seven-year bonds on Sept. 6.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
