Indian (SENSEX)  stocks climbed to a two-week
high as a decline in oil prices countered the nation’s slowest
economic growth in four years. Metalmakers and consumer goods
companies led the increase.  Tata Steel Ltd. (TATA) , the country’s biggest producer of the
alloy, soared 5.6 percent, the top performer on the benchmark
index today. Cigarette maker  ITC Ltd. (ITC)  jumped the most in two
months after it raised prices.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , owner
of the world’s largest refining complex, rose to a five-week
high. Brent oil fell as much as 1.6 percent.  The S&P BSE Sensex surged 1.4 percent to 18,886.13 at the
close in Mumbai. Oil prices dropped after U.S. President  Barack
Obama  delayed action against Syria by seeking approval from
Congress, easing concern that an imminent strike would disrupt
Middle East crude exports. Lower energy costs may help cool
inflation and trim the current account deficit in India, which
imports 80 percent of its oil requirements.  “The biggest relief is that there’s no strike on Syria and
oil has cooled,” Kaushik Dani, a fund manager at Peerless
Mutual Fund, which has about $685 million in assets, said by
phone from Mumbai. “The long-term picture hasn’t changed much,
but we are seeing some buying at lower levels.”  Tata Steel jumped 5.6 percent to 289.4 rupees. The stock
rallied 27 percent in August, ending seven months of losses.
Aluminum producer  Hindalco Industries Ltd. (HNDL)  gained 3.7 percent to
108.95 rupees. Jindal Steel & Power Ltd. climbed 2.8 percent to
227.95 rupees, after slumping 8.9 percent on Aug. 30.  Cigarette Prices  ITC jumped 3.8 percent to 320.4 rupees, the biggest gain
since July 4. The company increased prices of Gold Flake and
Classic Milds cigarette brands by about 10 percent, according to
four distributors surveyed. ITC spokesman Nazeeb Arif did not
respond to two calls to his cell phone.  Hindustan Unilever Ltd. (HUVR) 
added 1.6 percent to 641.3 rupees, a five-week high. The two
stocks have a combined 15 percent weighting in the Sensex.  Reliance climbed 3.9 percent to 886.75 rupees. Carmaker
 Maruti Suzuki India Ltd. (MSIL)  rallied 4.5 percent to 1,300 rupees
after its sales surged 61 percent in August from a year earlier.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s third-biggest lender by
market value, rose 2.8 percent to 826.6 rupees.  Axis Bank Ltd. (AXSB) 
surged 3.8 percent to 864.3 rupees. Yes Bank Ltd. jumped 3.9
percent to 252.95 rupees. The S&P BSE Bankex climbed, taking its
three-day gain to 4.2 percent, the most since July 1. The gauge
sank 10 percent last month, its fourth month of loss.  Monetary Tightening  India’s economy grew 4.4 percent in the June quarter, the
weakest pace since 2009, a government report showed on Aug. 30,
pressuring Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  to stem a plunge in the
rupee that led the  Reserve Bank  of India to increase two
 interest rates  and tighten the supply of cash in July.  The Sensex added 0.5 percent last week as oil prices fell
and Singh said policy changes in the past year will help shore
up the currency. The rupee rebounded 4.6 percent from a record
low in the past two days after the RBI said on Aug. 28 it will
sell dollars to state-run oil buyers.  “Steps taken to arrest the rupee depreciation are showing
some effect,” Peerless Mutual’s Dani said.  India’s gross domestic product growth increase in the June
quarter compared with 4.8 percent in the prior three months. The
median of 44 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a 4.7
percent gain. HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today said
the nation’s manufacturing purchasing managers’ index for August
fell to 48.5 from 50.1 in July. A reading greater than 50 shows
expansion, while less than 50 is contraction.  About 47 percent of Sensex companies that posted earnings
for the June quarter missed analyst estimates. That compares
with 27 percent for the March quarter, and 43 percent in the
three months ended December, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The Sensex is  valued  at 13.4 times projected 12-month
earnings versus a five-year average of 14.1 times, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. That compares with 10.2 times for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index.  The CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  on the National Stock Exchange increased 1.4
percent to 5,550.75. India VIX, which measures the cost of
protection against losses in the Nifty, lost 0.9 percent, its
third day of drop.  --With assistance from  Manish Modi in New Delhi and Santanu
