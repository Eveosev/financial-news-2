Female physicians in the U.S.
continue to earn less than their male counterparts, with the pay
gap widening during the past two decades to more than $50,000
annually in 2010, researchers said.  Women doctors had a median annual income of $165,278 from
2006 to 2010, compared with yearly earnings of $221,297 for male
physicians, according to the report published today in  JAMA
Internal Medicine . While the annual pay for women doctors has
increased since the median of $134,995 in 1990, it’s only now
beginning to approach the $168,795 annually earned by men 20
years ago, the researchers found.  The number of female doctors has soared since  Title IX  of
the U.S. Civil Rights Act was enacted almost 40 years ago, with
women now accounting for one-third of all doctors and half of
medical school students. Their pay hasn’t kept pace, said the
researchers led by  Seth Seabury , an associate professor in the
University of Southern California medical school and a fellow at
the university’s Center for Health Policy & Economics.  The study used data from the  Current Population Survey  and
couldn’t adjust for a physician’s specialty or practice type,
which may account for some of the gender pay gap, the
researchers said. It’s important to understand the pay disparity
regardless because there is no definitive way to know everything
that plays a role in those employment decisions, they said.  “Specialty and practice choices may be due to not only
preferences of female physicians but also unequal
opportunities,” the researchers said. “For example, are
unadjusted earnings differences between male and female
physicians due to a preference of female physicians for lower-paying specialties -- pediatrics or primary care -- or do female
physicians have less opportunity to enter higher paying
specialties despite having similar preferences as male
physicians?”  The researchers said the reasons for “the persistent
gender gap in physician earnings” merit further study.  To contact the reporter on this story:
