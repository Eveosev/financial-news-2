Two reversals by U.K. ministers over
what type of aircraft to fly off the aircraft carriers they’re
building will cost at least 74 million pounds ($115 million), a
panel of lawmakers said.  Prime Minister  David Cameron ’s government inherited plans
to fly a jump-jet variant of  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) ’s F-35 Joint
Strike Fighter, known as the F-35B, from the two carriers
currently under construction. In October 2010, it said it would
switch to the F-35C, launched with a catapult and arrester-wire
system. In May 2012, the government went back on that plan,
reverting to the jump-jets.  Parliament’s Public Accounts Committee said today the 2010
decision was taken on the basis of “deeply flawed and immature
information.” It questioned in a report published in London
whether staff at the Ministry of Defence had the necessary
skills to manage the carrier project and asked the National
Audit Office to investigate.  “When this program got the green light in 2007, we were
supposed to get two aircraft carriers, available from 2016 and
2018, at a cost to the taxpayer of 3.65 billion pounds,” the
committee chairwoman,  Margaret Hodge  from the opposition  Labour
Party , said in an e-mailed statement. “We are now on course to
spend 5.5 billion pounds and have no aircraft-carrier capability
for nearly a decade.”  The short-takeoff, vertical-landing F-35Bs have also been
chosen by the U.S. Marine Corps.  The U.K. is one of the U.S.’s eight partners on the $382
billion JSF program, the Pentagon’s most expensive. The others
are Australia, Turkey, Italy, the Netherlands, Canada, Denmark
and  Norway .  To contact the reporter on this story:
