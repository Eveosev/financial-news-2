Imperial Tobacco Group Plc, (IMT)  Europe’s
second-biggest tobacco company, agreed to buy  Dragonite
International Ltd. (329) ’s electronic cigarette unit for $75 million
as it seeks to close the gap on competitors in new products.  The acquisition depends on the approval of Dragonite
shareholders, according to Imperial Tobacco spokesman Simon Evans, who declined to comment further today.  The maker of Davidoff cigarettes is trailing the likes of
 British American Tobacco Plc (BATS)  and Philip Morris International
Inc. in developing alternatives to traditional cigarettes in
response to stricter government regulations on smoking.  The Bristol, England-based company said last month it was
on track to introduce its own alternative nicotine products in
2014 through the Fontem Ventures unit. The Dragonite purchase
isn’t related to that announcement, Evans said.  Dragonite founder and executive director Hon Lik invented
the electronic cigarette, according to the company’s  web site. 
The company says it owns an “extensive portfolio” of global
patents and pending patents covering e-cigarette technologies.  Imperial Tobacco  traded 0.6 percent higher at 2,145 pence
as of 11:01 a.m. in London. Dragonite International slipped 3.2
percent to HK$1.50 at the close of trading in Hong Kong, giving
the company a market value of HK$318 million ($41 million).  To contact the reporter on this story:
