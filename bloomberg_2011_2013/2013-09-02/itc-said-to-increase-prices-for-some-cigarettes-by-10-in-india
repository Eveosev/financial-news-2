ITC Ltd. (ITC) ,  India ’s largest tobacco
company, has raised prices of its Gold Flake and Classic Milds
brands by about 10 percent, according to four distributors. The
stock gained the most in two months.  The price of a 10-cigarette pack of Gold Flake Kings will
rise to 75 rupees ($1.13) from 68 rupees and a 20-unit pack of
Classic Milds will increase to 150 rupees from 136 rupees,
according to the distributors, who asked not to be named because
they aren’t authorized to talk to the media. Nazeeb Arif, ITC
spokesman, didn’t immediately respond to two calls to his mobile
phone.  ITC’s decision to raise retail prices comes after the
Kolkata, India-based company reported that quarterly profit
expanded at the slowest pace in four years due to weaker
economic growth. The company, which is partly owned by  British
American Tobacco Plc (BATS) , may be raising prices to offset increases
in cigarette taxes in some states, Nitin Mathur, an analyst at
Espirito Santo Investment Bank, said via phone today.  “ITC typically raises cigarette prices twice a year to
offset some excise tax increases,” Mumbai-based Mathur said.
The company gets all of its tobacco from within the country, so
the rupee’s record plunge is unlikely to have had a significant
impact, he said.  Shares of ITC rose 3.8 percent, the most since July 4, to
320.40 rupees at the close in Mumbai.  The company will invest 260 billion rupees to expand
businesses from cigarettes to hotels , Chairman Yogesh Chander Deveshwar said in July. ITC will use its profits to make the
investment, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
