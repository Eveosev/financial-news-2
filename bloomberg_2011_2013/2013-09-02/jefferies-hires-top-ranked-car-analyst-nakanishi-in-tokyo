Jefferies Group LLC hired Takaki Nakanishi, the former top-ranked auto analyst at Bank of America
Corp.’s Merrill Lynch, as a senior equity research analyst
covering the sector in  Japan .  Nakanishi, who left Merrill Lynch in June to start his own
research firm covering the  auto industry , was hired by
Jefferies, according to an e-mailed statement from the company.  Nakanishi’s “significant background, industry knowledge
and client relationships in the global automotive sector
strengthen our leading research franchise and add immediate
value to our global equity offering,” Steven R. Black, global
head of equity research at Jefferies, wrote in an e-mailed
statement.  Nakanishi’s career at Merrill Lynch began in 1995. He left
in 2002 to take positions including head of Japan research at
JPMorgan Chase & Co. before returning to Merrill Lynch in 2011.
He was rated No. 1 auto analyst in Japan this year by
Institutional Investor magazine and first in a Nikkei Veritas
newspaper poll.  To contact the reporters on this story:
