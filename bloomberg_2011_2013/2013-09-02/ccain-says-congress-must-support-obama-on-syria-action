Republican Senator  John McCain  said Congress must back taking action against Syria and that a failure of lawmakers to act would be “catastrophic” for U.S. interests in the region.  McCain spoke after meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House and said congressional leaders are working on a resolution authorizing military action in Syria that can pass both the House and Senate, where some lawmakers of both parties are expressing skepticism about further committing U.S. resources.  McCain, of Arizona, was joined at the meeting by Republican  Senator Lindsey Graham  of South Carolina. Both lawmakers have been advocating a more aggressive U.S. response to the civil war in Syria.  Obama said he wants congressional approval to take action following evidence that the regime of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad used chemical weapons against civilians.
