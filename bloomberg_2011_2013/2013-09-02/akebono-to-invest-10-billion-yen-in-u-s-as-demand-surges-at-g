Akebono Brake Industry Co. (7238) , a
Japanese auto-parts maker that counts  General Motors Co. (GM)  as its
biggest customer, is increasing its bet that U.S. auto industry
expansion will fuel a revival of earnings growth.  The brake supplier to GM, Ford Motor Co. and Nissan Motor
Co. will spend about 7 billion yen ($71 million) this year and 3
billion yen next year to expand in  North America , its biggest
market, Akebono President Hisataka Nobumoto said in an
interview. That compares with 6 billion yen last year.  Akebono, which  paid $19 million  for Robert Bosch GmbH’s
North American brake unit in 2009, is expanding output of rotors
at its Clarksville, Tennessee, factory as the U.S. auto industry
heads for its best sales year since 2007. Nobumoto said he
expects a revival in  earnings growth  after rising demand allowed
the company to boost parts prices in the U.S.  “We can expect demand in the U.S. to continue to stay
strong for the next year or two,” Nobumoto, 64, said last week
at the company’s Tokyo headquarters office.  GM accounted for about 24 percent of the Tokyo-based
company’s revenue in the year ended March. Led by demand for its
 pickup trucks , Detroit-based GM has boosted sales 9 percent this
year, according to industry researcher Autodata Corp.  Akebono plunged as much as 10 percent on July 31, a day
after reporting profit fell in the first quarter. The shares
fell 1.2 percent to 418 yen, the lowest since April 4, at the
close in Tokyo trading today, compared with a 1.4 percent gain
in the benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average.  Given the rebound in the U.S. auto market, we had expected
a better first quarter, Nobumoto said.  Net income will probably increase almost fivefold to  2.5
billion yen  in the year ending March 2014, the company
forecasts. Profit dropped 48 percent from a year earlier to 478
million yen in the three months ended June 30, as prices for
some parts in the U.S. were below cost.  To contact the reporters on this story:
