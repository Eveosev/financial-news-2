The Baltimore Orioles scored seven
runs in the seventh inning to rally for a 7-3 victory over the
 New York Yankees  and avoid a three-game series sweep.  Adam Jones  and J.J. Hardy each hit three-run home runs  for
the Orioles, who ended an 18-inning Major League Baseball
scoreless drought with their outburst against  Andy Pettitte  and
the Yankees’ bullpen yesterday in New York.  The Orioles improved to 72-63 and are three games back in
the race for the second of the American League’s two wild-card
playoff berths. The Yankees dropped to 72-64 and are 3 1/2 games
behind the Tampa Bay Rays, who lost to the Oakland Athletics 5-1
yesterday.  The A’s beat the Rays 5-1 to sweep their series and move 2
1/2 games ahead of Tampa Bay for the AL’s top wild card berth
and within one game of the  Texas Rangers  in the AL Western
Division race. The Rangers lost to Minnesota 4-2.  The AL East-leading Boston Red Sox completed a three-game
sweep of the Chicago White Sox with a 7-6 win, while the Detroit
Tigers, who are atop the AL Central, were shut out 4-0 by the
Cleveland Indians.  The St. Louis Cardinals moved back into a tie with
Pittsburgh atop the National League Central Division with a 7-2
win over the Pirates.  The NL West-leading Los Angeles Dodgers swept the San Diego
Padres as Yasiel Puig hit a go-ahead homer in the sixth inning
of a 2-1 win.  To contact the reporter on this story:
