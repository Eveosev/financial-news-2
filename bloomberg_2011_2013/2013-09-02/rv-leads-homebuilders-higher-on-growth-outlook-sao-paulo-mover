MRV Engenharia & Participacoes SA (MRVE3) ,
Brazil’s second-biggest homebuilder by market value, rallied as
economists increased their projections for economic growth this
year, fueling optimism on real-estate demand.  The shares advanced 5.2 percent to 8.76 reais at the close
of trading in Sao Paulo, the highest level since April 23. The
BM&FBovespa Real Estate Index added 3.5 percent.  Nineteen out of 20 stocks in the real-estate gauge rose
today. Gafisa SA climbed 5 percent to 2.94 reais, PDG Realty SA
gained 6.5 percent to 2.45 reais and  Brookfield Incorporacoes SA (BISA3) 
advanced 7.6 percent to 1.83 reais. Cyrela Brazil Realty SA, the
nation’s biggest homebuilder by market value, rose 2.2 percent
to 16.06 reais.  “A scenario of bigger growth for  Brazil  is positive for
homebuilders as it should mean higher revenue,” Felipe Rocha,
an analyst at brokerage firm Omar Camargo, said by phone from
Curitiba, Brazil.  Economists covering Brazil raised their growth forecasts
for this year to 2.32 percent from 2.20 percent, according to
the median of about 100 estimates in a central bank survey
published today.  Brazil’s gross domestic product advanced 1.5 percent in the
second quarter from the prior three months, the national
statistics agency reported Aug. 30. The expansion exceeded the
projections of all of the 44 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
