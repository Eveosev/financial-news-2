Robert Griffin III will start at
quarterback for the Washington Redskins when they open their
National Football League season Sept. 9 against the Philadelphia
Eagles, coach  Mike Shanahan  told reporters today.  The decision comes eight months after Griffin, 23, had
surgery to repair a torn ligament in his right knee.  “He’s gotten a lot of great reps in practice, no setbacks,
no swelling,” Shanahan said in comments released by the
Redskins on Twitter. “We believe he can do everything a
quarterback is asked to do.”  Griffin, a Pro Bowl selection last year in his rookie
season, was injured in the Redskins’ playoff loss to the  Seattle
Seahawks  on Jan. 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
