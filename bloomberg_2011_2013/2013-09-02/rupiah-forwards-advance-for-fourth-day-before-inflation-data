Indonesia’s rupiah forwards gained
for a fourth day, the longest winning streak since July, after
the central bank raised borrowing costs to restrain accelerating
inflation.  The currency advanced from the weakest level since April
2009 last week as  Bank Indonesia  said it would hold an
additional meeting on Aug. 29 to review monetary and economic
conditions. The monetary authority raised the  reference rate  to
7 percent, the highest since June 2009, at the session.  Consumer
prices (IDCPIY)  probably gained 8.95 percent in August, which would be
the most since January 2009, according to the median estimate in
a Bloomberg survey before data due at 11 a.m. today.  “Bank Indonesia has preempted inflation by raising rates,
which is driving the rally in the rupiah’s offshore markets,”
said Suriyanto Chang, head of treasury at PT Bank QNB Kesawan in
Jakarta. “Exporters are beginning to sell dollars as the market
has priced in the current-account deficit and inflation, and the
rupiah is already at levels not seen for a long time.”  Rupiah one-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.3
percent to 11,398 per dollar as of 9:18 a.m. in Jakarta, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The contracts traded at a 4.2
percent discount to the spot rate, which was little changed at
10,918, after slumping 5.9 percent in August, the biggest drop
since November 2008, prices from local banks show.  A  fixing  used to settle the derivatives set by the
Association of Banks in  Singapore  was 11,275 on Aug. 30. One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves in the
 exchange rate  used to price options, declined eight basis points
to 18.31 percent, the lowest since Aug. 26, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Indonesia’s current-account gap widened to a record $9.8
billion in the second quarter, according to central bank data.
The shortfall will narrow this quarter, Bank Indonesia spokesman
Difi Johansyah said on Aug. 29.  The yield on  government bonds  due May 2023 rose one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 8.42 percent, prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
