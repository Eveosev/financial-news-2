Kweichow Moutai Co. (600519) , the nation’s
biggest liquor maker by market value, fell the most in seven
years after profit trailed Capital Securities Corp.’s estimate
and concern grew that a government crackdown on lavish spending
will continue to hurt demand.  Moutai, which produces a fiery white liquor called baijiu,
slumped by the 10 percent daily limit to 151.90  yuan  as of 10:07
a.m. local time, heading for the steepest drop since May 2006
and the lowest level since 2010. The stock was the biggest drag
on the  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) , which slipped 0.2 percent.  The company’s first-half net income rose 3.6 percent to
7.25 billion yuan ($1.2 billion), according to a company
statement after markets shut on Aug. 30. That trailed Capital
Securities’ estimate for 10 percent growth, according to Liu Hui, an analyst at the brokerage.  “First-half earnings were much lower than expectations,”
Liu said phone from  Shanghai . “With strict controls on
government purchases of expensive liquor, they are not going to
get a boost in sales for the second half of the year. Earnings
will remain weak.”  Demand for Moutai’s high-end baijiu liquor, popular at
official banquets and for gift giving, has fallen as Chinese
President Xi Jinping has pushed to curb extravagant  government
spending . Moutai’s shares rose 26 percent in the two years
through 2012 before plunging 27 percent this year.  China’s new party leadership pledged in December to reduce
lavish receptions and live more frugally. Xihad warned that
unless corruption is reduced at all levels of government, social
unrest may rise and lead to the party’s demise. Moutai fell to
13th place this year from fifth in 2012 among the top brands
picked by Chinese millionaires as gifts for friends and business
contacts, according to a survey by Hurun Report Inc.  -- Editors: Allen Wan, Richard Frost  To contact the reporter on this story:
