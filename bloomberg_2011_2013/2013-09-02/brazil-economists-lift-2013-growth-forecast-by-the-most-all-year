Brazil  economists raised their 2013
growth forecast for the first time since March after the economy
expanded faster than expected during the second quarter on a
jump in investments.  Brazil’s gross domestic product will expand 2.32 percent
this year, compared with the previous week’s forecast of 2.2
percent, according to the Aug. 30 central bank survey of about
100 analysts published today. It was the biggest upward growth
revision all year.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
sustain a pick-up in growth and a decline in annual inflation in
the world’s second-largest emerging market. Brazil last month
introduced a $60 billion currency intervention plan and raised
the key rate for a fourth straight meeting to help tame price
increases near the upper limit of the central bank’s target
range. Economic expansion in the  second quarter  reached the
fastest pace in over three years on the back of a 3.6 percent
increase in investments.  Swap rates on the contract due in January 2015 fell seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 10.46 percent at 9:05
a.m. local time. The real strengthened by 0.9 percent to 2.3644
per  U.S. dollar  and has declined 9.5 percent in the past three
months, the most among 16 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg.  Faster Growth  Gross domestic product expanded 1.5 percent in the April to
June period, or an annualized 6 percent, the national statistics
agency said on Friday. That was the most since the first quarter
of 2010 and more than all 44 forecasts from analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg, whose median estimate was 0.9 percent.  The central bank on Aug. 28 raised its benchmark Selic rate
to 9 percent from 8.5 percent, extending the biggest interest
rate increase this year among major economies. Policy makers
said in an accompanying statement that the decision will help
put inflation on decline. Economists in the survey predicted the
Selic will reach 9.50 percent at year-end, and raised their
forecast for year-end 2014 to 9.75 percent from 9.50 percent.  Consumer prices as measured by the IPCA-15 index rose 0.16
percent in the month through mid-August, up from 0.07 percent in
mid-July. Annual inflation in mid-August slowed to 6.15 percent
after reaching a 2013 high of 6.67 percent in mid-June. Policy
makers target annual inflation at 4.5 percent, plus or minus two
percentage points.  Economists raised their 2013 inflation forecast to 5.83
percent from 5.80 percent the previous week, the survey said.
Analysts also forecast the real will weaken from 2.36 per dollar
at year-end this year to 2.40 next year, from the previous
week’s projection of 2.32 and 2.38 percent, respectively.  Latin America ’s largest economy will expand by about 2.5
percent this year and 4 percent next year, according to Finance
Minister  Guido Mantega .  To contact the reporter on this story:
