Taiwan dollar forwards rose the most
in more than two months as a jump in China’s manufacturing gauge
signaled a recovery in the world’s second-largest economy.  The  Purchasing Managers ’ Index in Taiwan’s biggest export
market advanced to a 16-month high of 51 in August, official
data showed yesterday, prompting JPMorgan Chase & Co. to join
Deutsche Bank AG and Credit Suisse Group AG in raising growth
estimates for China’s economy. Taiwan had $409 billion in
foreign reserves, the third-largest in Asia, as of July 31, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  One-month non-deliverable forwards increased 0.7 percent,
the most since June 25, to NT$29.705 per  U.S. dollar  as of 4:20
p.m. in Taipei, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. They
touched NT$29.685 earlier, the strongest level since June 7.  “China’s PMI had an impact to some extent, and now as many
Asian currencies depreciate, we see currencies of countries with
large foreign reserves like  South Korea , Singapore and Taiwan
have been stronger,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund
manager  at Uni-President Assets Management Corp.  In the spot market, the local dollar strengthened 0.3
percent to NT$29.900 against the greenback, Taipei Forex Inc.
prices show. It was trading 0.5 percent stronger three minutes
before the 4 p.m. close today. The central bank has sold the
currency in the run-up to the close on most days since March
2012, according to traders who asked not to be identified.  One-month implied volatility, a gauge of expected moves in
the  exchange rate  used to price options, rose 11 basis points to
3.84 percent. The  overnight interbank lending rate  was little
changed today at 0.385 percent, a weighted average compiled by
the Taiwan Interbank Money Center showed.  Taiwan’s Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index rose to
50 in August, up from 48.6 in July, according to HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit data released today.  The yield on  government bonds  due September 2023, which
will be sold at an auction on Sept. 14, dropped one basis point
to 1.72 percent in when-issued trading that began last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
