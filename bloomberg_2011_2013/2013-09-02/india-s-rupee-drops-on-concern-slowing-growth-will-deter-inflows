India ’s rupee fell, snapping a two-day rally, on concern slowing growth will make it tougher for
the country to attract capital as the U.S. prepares to taper
monetary stimulus.  Gross domestic product rose 4.4 percent in the three months
through June from a year earlier, the slowest pace since 2009,
according to an official report on Aug. 30. HSBC Holdings Plc
today lowered its growth forecast following cuts by UBS AG,
 Standard Chartered  Plc and BNP Paribas SA last week. The U.S.
may trim monthly bond purchases this month and end the buying by
mid-2014, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists before
the  Federal Open Market Committee  meets Sept. 17-18.  “September will bring a lot of event risk for financial
markets to absorb,” Tim Fox, chief economist at Emirates NBD in
Dubai, wrote in a research report today. The rupee will stay
under pressure and the role of incoming central bank Governor
Raghuram Rajan, who takes charge Sept. 5, will be considered
“crucial” as growth slows and inflation stays high, he wrote.  The rupee weakened 0.1 percent to 65.7550 per dollar as of
10:33 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency weakened as much as 0.7
percent earlier and plunged 8.1 percent last month, the biggest
drop since March 1992 and the steepest among 78 global
currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It touched an unprecedented
68.8450 on Aug. 28.  Global funds withdrew a net $2.4 billion from Indian stocks
and bonds last month, leaving the rupee vulnerable to the
nation’s current-account deficit. One-month implied volatility
in the rupee, a measure of expected moves in the  exchange rate 
used to price options, rose 52 basis points, or 0.52 percentage
point, today to 21.25 percent.  Growth Forecasts  HSBC now sees India growing at 4 percent in the year
through March 2014, compared with an earlier estimate of 5.5
percent. Standard Chartered predicts the economy will grow 4.7
percent versus 5.5 percent, UBS cut its projection to 4.7
percent from 5.2 percent and BNP to 3.7 percent from 5.2
percent.  The rupee surged 4.8 percent in the two days through Aug.
30, as the  Reserve Bank  of India started selling dollars to the
largest state-run oil importers through foreign-exchange swaps.
India ships in about 80 percent of its fuel, and a weaker
currency stokes inflation.  U.S. President  Barack Obama  said he’ll seek authorization
from Congress before ordering military action against  Syria ,
easing concern that an imminent strike would disrupt Middle East
oil exports.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.5 percent today
to 67.34 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show, Offshore
non-deliverable contracts advanced 2.2 percent to 67.95.
Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and
date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
