European Union sugar output will
drop 7.6 percent in the 12 months starting in October, according
to a draft of the 28-nation blocâ€™s first estimate of the crop.  Production will fall to 15.9 million metric tons in
2013-14, from 17.2 million tons a year earlier, according to the
Aug. 27 document obtained by  Bloomberg News . The provisional
figures will be adjusted as new information comes in,  Roger
Waite , an EU spokesman in Brussels, wrote in an e-mail today.  Output will drop 1.9 percent to 4.3 million metric tons in
France, 13 percent to 3.5 million tons in Germany, 4.4 percent
to 1.1 million tons in the U.K. and 11 percent to 1.6 million
tons in  Poland , the estimates show. Farmers sowed 2.4 percent
fewer acres after prices fell 32 percent in the past two years.  Refined sugar for October delivery rose 0.2 percent to $479
a ton by 12:15 p.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Futures slumped 44
percent from a record in February 2011 as the global supply glut
expanded to the highest ever.  To contact the reporter on this story:
