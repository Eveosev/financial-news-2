Cia. de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo,  Brazil ’s biggest water utility, requested three
months to evaluate, clarify and make proper changes in its
regulatory payment base, according to a regulatory filing.  Sao Paulo state water and energy regulator Arsesp suspended
a scheduled rate review in July because it didn’t have enough
board members to proceed. It maintained the suspension after
finding “inconsistencies” in documents the company submitted.  Sabesp, as the utility is known, also requested a rate
review based on inflation. It didn’t obtain an answer from
Arsesp. The company will hold a conference call on Sept. 6 to
discuss the subject, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
