Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES) , Dubai’s biggest
bank, hired Manoj Chawla from  Standard Chartered  Plc to be its
chief risk officer, two people familiar with the move said.  Chawla, who was the Dubai-based chief country risk officer
for Standard Chartered in the  United Arab Emirates , replaces
Rajan Khetarpal, said the people, asking not to be identified
because the information is private. Khetarpal will become chief
integration officer for Emirates NBD’s recently acquired
Egyptian unit, according to the people.  A spokesman for Emirates NBD, who asked not to be
identified because of company policy, confirmed the move, while
a spokesman for Standard Chartered confirmed Chawla’s departure.  Emirates NBD this year completed the acquisition of French
bank BNP Paribas SA’s Egyptian unit in a $500 million deal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
