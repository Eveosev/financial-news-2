The yen dropped to a one-month low
versus the dollar as signs of economic improvement around the
globe damped demand for refuge assets while data from the  Bank
of Japan  signaled progress in the central bank’s easing efforts.  Japan’s currency slid versus 14 of its 16 major peers after
data showed the nation’s monetary base expanded by the most in
40 years. The dollar touched a six-week high against the euro
before U.S. data that economists said will show factory output
increased for a third month in August, boosting speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will start to taper its quantitative-easing
program. The Australian dollar advanced and Indonesia’s rupiah
fell to a four-year low.  “Our long-term view is that there will be yen weakness,”
said Derek Mumford, a director at Rochford Capital, a foreign-exchange risk-management company in Sydney. The currency will
“inevitably weaken, particularly against the dollar with the
prospect of winding back of QE in the very near future by the
Fed and the very fact that the BOJ will keep printing money.”  The yen depreciated 0.3 percent to 99.67 per dollar as of
8:36 a.m. London time, after touching 99.70, the weakest since
Aug. 2. It slid 0.1 percent to 131.20 per euro after dropping 1
percent yesterday. The dollar advanced 0.2 percent to $1.3162
per euro after reaching $1.3161, the strongest since July 22.  The Bloomberg  U.S. Dollar   Index (CPMINMAN) , which tracks the
greenback’s performance against a basket of 10 major currencies,
gained 0.2 percent to 1,037.28, the highest since July 16.  Manufacturing Rebound  The Institute for Supply Management’s U.S.  factory index 
was 54 in August, a third month of expansion, and compared with
a two-year high of 55.4 in July, economists forecast before the
release of the data today. The Fed, which purchases $85 billion
a month in Treasury and mortgage debt, will reduce the amount at
its next meeting on Sept. 17-18, according to 65 percent of
economists in an Aug. 9-13 Bloomberg survey.  The European Union’s statistics office will confirm
tomorrow that  gross domestic product  in the 17-nation currency
bloc expanded 0.3 percent in the April-June period, ending the
longest recession on record, according to the median estimate of
economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News .  China’s non-manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell
to 53.9 last month from 54.1 in July, data showed today. A
reading above 50 indicates expansion.  Emerging Markets  Emerging-market currencies have slumped amid concern higher
yields in the U.S. will accelerate capital outflows.  The  Bloomberg-JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index (ADXY) , which tracks
Asia’s major currencies except the yen, touched 113.58 on Aug.
23, the lowest since September 2010. It dropped 0.3 percent to
114.29 today. It had risen 4.7 percent from a June 2012 low to
its 2013 high of 119 in May.  “Most of the Asian currencies appreciated quite a bit
against the U.S. dollar,”  Kumar Palghat , a Sydney-based  money
manager  and founder of Kapstream Capital, which oversees about
$5.2 billion, said in an interview with Bloomberg Television.
“Now it’s just their turn to go down and the dollar’s going up
because the  U.S. economy  looks a lot better.”  The rupiah slid 0.8 percent to 11,065 per dollar, the
weakest level since April 2009, prices from local banks compiled
by Bloomberg show.  The BOJ said today Japan’s monetary base expanded 42
percent in August from a year earlier, the biggest gain since
November 1973, to 177 trillion yen. The central bank buys more
than 7 trillion yen of Japanese  government bonds  every month to
 increase  the gauge of the supply of money to 270 trillion yen by
the end of 2014 and stoke 2 percent inflation. BOJ policy makers
are meeting this week.  Australia’s dollar rose after the nation’s  Reserve Bank 
held its benchmark rate unchanged at 2.5 percent and refrained
from signaling further monetary easing. The decision was in line
with estimates of all 32 economists in a Bloomberg survey.  The Aussie gained 0.6 percent to 90.31 U.S. cents.  To contact the reporters on this story:
