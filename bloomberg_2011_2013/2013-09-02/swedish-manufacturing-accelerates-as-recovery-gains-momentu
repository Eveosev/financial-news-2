Swedenâ€™s manufacturing  expansion
accelerated in August, signaling a strengthening recovery in the
largest Nordic economy.  An index based on responses from about 200 purchasing
managers rose to a seasonally adjusted 52.2 in August from 51.3
the prior month, Stockholm-based  Swedbank AB (SWEDA) , which compiles the
data, said today. A reading above 50 indicates an expansion. It
was seen rising to 52.4, according to the  median estimate  of
seven economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  The central bank in July kept its repo rate unchanged at 1
percent for a third consecutive meeting after easing policy four
times since 2011 and said it plans to raise rates in the second
half next year. Seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell to its
lowest in more than a year to 7.8 percent in July, while both
Swedish manufacturing and  consumer confidence  rose last month.  The production sub-index fell to 53.9 from 56.0, while the
order index increased to 54.5 from 52.1, Swedbank said. The
employment index rose to 48.2 from 44.9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
