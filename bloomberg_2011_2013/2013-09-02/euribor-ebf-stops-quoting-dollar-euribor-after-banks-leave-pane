Euribor-EBF ceased quoting Euribor
in dollars after half the banks left the panel that sets the
rate.  The benchmark, which measures the costs of borrowing in
dollars, ended on Sept. 1, according to the  website  of the
Brussels-based industry group that sets the rate. The number of
banks contributing to the gauge had fallen to 10 from 20 at its
inception in April 2012, Euribor-EBF said.  The discontinuation of the dollar Euribor index “should
have no impact on legacy or prospective contracts given the
limited level of diffusion of this index,” the group  said  in a
statement on Aug. 25.  Commerzbank AG and Natixis were the latest lenders to
depart the panel, quitting in July. Firms are withdrawing from
interest-rate benchmarks amid concern they could face penalties
if they are found to have engaged in wrongdoing. Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc, UBS AG and Barclays Plc have been fined more
than $2.5 billion for rigging the London interbank offered rate
and Euribor.  New European Union rules will include the power to force
banks to make submissions to Euribor, a gauge of banks’
estimated cost of borrowing in euros over different periods of
time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
