Gold may extend its decline as
technical indicators signal a loss of momentum, according to an
analysis from Haitong Futures Co., a unit of  China ’s second-largest brokerage.  Bullion’s moving average convergence-divergence indicator,
known as the MACD, looks set to drop below the signal line,
suggesting that gold may be heading for further losses, said
Dong Zhuying, an investment consultant at Haitong. Traders tend
to sell contracts when the MACD declines below the signal line.  Gold tumbled 17 percent this year as some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value. The MACD is a plot of
values obtained by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving
average from the 12-day average. The signal line is a nine-day
exponential moving average of the MACD, and provides buy and
sell indicators.  “For the downward trend to be confirmed, a break below the
trend line must be sustained,” she said, without giving a price
target. “It’s too early to tell if the downward momentum will
continue, especially since there’s been some selling pressure
after gold looked overbought last week.”  Gold reached a three-month high of $1,433.83 an ounce on
Aug. 28, pushing its relative-strength index above 70, a level
that suggests to some analysts the price may be set to decline.
The RSI gauge was at 57.7 today as spot gold fell for a third
day, losing 0.8 percent to $1,384.18 at 8:44 a.m. in  Singapore .  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
