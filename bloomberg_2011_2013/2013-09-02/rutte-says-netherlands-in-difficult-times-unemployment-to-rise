The Netherlands is going through
extraordinarily difficult economic times and unemployment will
continue to rise for some time, Prime Minister  Mark Rutte  said.  “Radical changes will come to the Netherlands,” Rutte
said in a lecture in Amsterdam today. “We stand for fundamental
choices, and we need to make the right ones.”  The government will unveil a plan to save 6 billion euros
($7.9 billion) in parliament on Sept. 17. That’s on top of a
four-year, 16 billion-euro austerity package approved in
November when Rutte took office. The Dutch economy, in its third
recession since the financial crisis started in 2008,  shrank 0.2
percent  in the second quarter.  Rutte’s government, which comprises his  Liberal Party  and
the Labor Party, stands at an all-time low in the polls. The
coalition would only retain 32 of the 150 seats in parliament if
elections were held now, a drop of 47 seats, according to a
survey published by polling agency Peil.nl on Aug. 25. The  Labor
Party  would have 12 seats, while Rutte’s Liberal Party would get
20 seats, according to the poll.  To contact the reporter on this story:
