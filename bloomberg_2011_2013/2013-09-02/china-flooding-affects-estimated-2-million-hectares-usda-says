Flooding in Northeast  China  may have
affected more than 2 million hectares (4.94 million acres) of
crop land, the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s  Foreign
Agricultural Service  wrote, citing local estimates.  The region had “unusually heavy” summer rainfall, with
precipitation 40 percent to 50 percent above normal, resulting
in widespread flooded and waterlogged farmland, the FAS wrote in
an online  report  dated Aug. 29.  Northeast China is one of the country’s most important
farming regions, producing 42 percent of its corn, 45 percent of
soybeans and 16 percent of rice in 2011, the service wrote. The
four Northeast provinces had an estimated 28.7 million hectares
of planted area in 2011, according to the report.  “The impact of flooding on China’s total soybean crop,
which is planted intensively in Northeast China, is likely to be
proportionally greater than for corn or rice,” the FAS said.  Losses caused by flooding may be offset by higher yields in
areas outside the flood-impacted zones, the FAS wrote. The
service cited concerns that wetness could cause more-than-usual
disease and insect damage, while weather-related harvest delays
could lead to losses from early frost.  To contact the reporter on this story:
