Large international banks raised
about half a trillion dollars in fresh capital since 2009 and
are moving closer to complying with global capital rules, said
 Mark Carney , chairman of the Financial Stability Board.  Carney, who is the governor of the  Bank of England , said
that the capital raising has been “encouraging” though
“uneven,” in a press conference in London today.  Global banks had core capital reserves averaging about 9
percent of their risk-weighted assets at the end of 2012, above
the 7 percent required under the updated Basel standards, the
 Basel Committee on Banking Supervision  said in a report last
week.  All jurisdictions needed to comply with tougher capital
rules by 2019, Carney told journalists. The FSB brings together
regulators and central bankers from the Group of 20 nations.  To contact the reporter on this story:
