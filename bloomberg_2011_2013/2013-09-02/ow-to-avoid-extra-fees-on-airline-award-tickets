Question: Dear Wendy, Over the years I have used my miles for award travel to Europe paying a minimum of U.S. taxes. Recently I have checked into a reward ticket for travel this late fall. American Airlines is charging only 40,000 miles for a coach ticket but the tax that I must pay is $739.40! Delta requires 60,000 miles but the tax is only $143.70. Can you give me an idea of what is going on? Sincerely, Cindy B. Answer: Cindy, it's a great question, and one that I'm sure many other readers have. The perfect person to answer it is  Gary Leff of Book Your Award , who is one of my  trusted travel specialists  and knows the complicated ins and outs of frequent-flier-mile redemption.
