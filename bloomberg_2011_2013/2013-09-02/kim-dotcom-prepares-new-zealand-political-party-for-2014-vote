Kim Dotcom, the New Zealand-based
Internet entreneur who faces extradition to the U.S., is
planning a political party that could contest the 2014 general
election.  Information about the partyâ€™s vision and candidates will be
released on Jan. 20, 2014, Dotcom said in a post on his Twitter
feed today. The date will be exactly two years after police
raided his mansion north of Auckland seeking evidence to support
what the U.S. has described as the biggest copyright
infringement conspiracy in its history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
