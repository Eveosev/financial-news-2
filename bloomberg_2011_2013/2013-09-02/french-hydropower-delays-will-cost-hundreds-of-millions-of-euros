Delays in opening French hydropower
contracts to competition will cost local governments hundreds of
millions of euros in royalties, the state auditor said.  The stalled introduction of competitive bidding to operate
dams is “generating a growing shortfall in public finances,”
 Cours des Comptes  said today. Potential candidates are being
discouraged amid “an absence of clear government strategy.”  Hydro plants, the biggest source of power after nuclear,
are run by former monopoly utilities  Electricite de France SA 
and  GDF Suez SA. (GSZ)  President  Francois Hollande , amid opposition
from lawmakers in his Socialist party to bidding, has avoided
deciding whether to go ahead with predecessor  Nicolas Sarkozy ’s
plans to tender plants with total output of 5,300 megawatts.  The cost will be about 50 million euros ($66 million) this
year and reach 100 million euros in 2020, the auditor said in a
report. The accumulated loss through 2020 will be more than 250
million euros if contracts are opened up in 2016 and 600 million
euros otherwise, it said. Tenders won’t happen before the end of
2016 even if Hollande decides this year to go ahead, it said.  EDF operates 80 percent of France’s hydroelectric capacity
and GDF Suez 12 percent. The dams produce about 60 terawatt
hours a year with annual potential sales of 3 billion euros and
royalties of 520 million euros, according to the report.  “Additional reforms are envisaged, notably about renewing
hydroelectric concessions,” the  finance ministry  said in April
in an outline of economic plans for the year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
