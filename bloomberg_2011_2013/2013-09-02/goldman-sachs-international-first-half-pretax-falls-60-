Goldman Sachs International, the
European division of  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , said first-half
pretax profit fell 60 percent, hurt by a charge linked to
employee compensation.  Pretax profit dropped to $335.4 million in the first six
months of the year from $847.5 million in the year-earlier
period, the company said in a filing. Revenue fell 5 percent to
$3 billion.  Administrative expenses rose to $2.5 billion from $2.1
billion, due to a $516 million charge as the company marked the
value of stock-based compensation to market prices. Shares of
the New York-based parent have climbed more than 19 percent so
far this year.  Revenue from institutional client services, the fixed
income, currencies and commodities division, fell 11 percent to
$2.2 billion, while investment banking revenue climbed 41
percent to $591.4 million, the company said.  Goldman Sachs, based in  New York , is the top-ranked mergers
adviser in Western Europe, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The firm is advising  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  on its 7.7
billion euro ($10.2 billion) takeover offer for German cable
company Kabel Deutschland Holding AG.  To contact the reporter on this story:
