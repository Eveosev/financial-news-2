Coffee shipments from  Indonesia ’s
southern Sumatra, the main growing region in the world’s third-largest robusta producer, fell the most in two months in August
as Eid holidays slowed trade.  Exports of beans and instant coffee contracted 42 percent
to 32,263 metric tons last month from a four-year high of 55,709
tons in July, the Lampung Province Trade and Industry Office
said in a statement today. That’s the steepest decline since
June and compares with August 2012 sales of 23,246 tons.  Robusta has gained 4.4 percent in London from a 32-month
low in June as farmers in Vietnam, the top grower, curbed sales
to boost prices. Inventories certified by NYSE Liffe will tumble
34 percent to 52,000 tons by the end of 2013, the lowest since
May 2000, because of Indonesian rain and reduced  Vietnam 
supplies, the average of 10 trader estimates in Bloomberg survey
published Aug. 27 showed.  “The main reason for drop in exports is the Eid al-Fitr
holiday” Moelyono Soesilo, purchasing and marketing manager at
trader PT Taman Delta Indonesia, said in a text message today.
“Weather has improved towards the normal dry season. If it
could last until October, this may help exports and we may see
good harvest next year.”  Muslims in Indonesia celebrated the Eid festival on Aug. 8
this year with a week-long holiday, delaying supplies of dried
beans for exports from plantations. Shipments jumped 80 percent
to 181,999 tons in the eight months through August, according to
Bloomberg calculations.  Indonesian Premium  Robusta futures for delivery in November rose 0.9 percent
to $1,779 a ton on the NYSE Liffe on Aug. 30. The premium for
delivery of Indonesian beans in September and October was
unchanged at about $60 to $80 a ton above prices in  London  last
week, Soesilo said.  Farmers have picked about 85 percent of beans in Lampung,
he said. Southern Sumatra normally accounts for 75 percent of
supplies from Indonesia, where the harvest began a month later
than usual in May this year because of the wet weather.  Indonesian deliveries to warehouses were unchanged at
24,000 tons last week from a week earlier as the harvest is
nearing the end and bean quality is lower than it was in the
peak season in July and August, Volcafe Ltd. said Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
