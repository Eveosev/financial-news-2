  Turkey ’s manufacturing sector
expanded in August after contracting for the first time in a
year the month before, buoyed by a falling lira and rising
export orders.  A gauge of manufacturing increased to 50.9 in August,
according to the HSBC purchasing managers’ index released by
Markit Economics today. That’s up from 49.8 in July and below a
2013 peak of 54 in January. A reading above 50 indicates
expansion and below 50, a contraction.  The Turkish lira has been hit by an  emerging markets 
selloff triggered by fears the U.S. Federal Reserve will cut
back stimulus that had increased the capital in circulation.
Lira weakness combined with improved business conditions gave a
boost to export orders, Melis Metiner, an HSBC economist in
Istanbul, said in an e-mailed statement.  “After dipping into contraction territory in July,
manufacturing conditions showed improvement in August,” Metiner
said. “Both total orders and export orders rose, but the latter
improved more sharply.”  The lira strengthened 1.2 percent to 2.0137 per dollar at
10:14 a.m. in Istanbul, paring year-to-date losses to 11.4
percent to become the worst-performing emerging markets currency
in  Europe , Africa and the  Middle East  after  South Africa ’s rand.  The  yield  on benchmark two-year notes fell 16 basis points,
or 0.16 percentage point, to 9.78 percent. That compares with a
2013 low of 4.79 percent on May 17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
