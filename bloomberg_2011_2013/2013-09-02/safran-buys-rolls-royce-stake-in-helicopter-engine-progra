Safran SA (SAF)  bought  Rolls-Royce
Holdings Plc (RR/) ’s stake in their RTM322 engine venture, giving the
French manufacturer full control of the program that provides
power for helicopters including  Boeing Co. (BA) ’s Apache.  Safran paid 239 million euros ($387 million) for the stake,
according to a statement today. Revenue from the Rolls-Royce
portion is about 85 million euros a year, Safran said in April
when an agreement was announced.  Turbomeca, the helicopter engine unit of Safran, will
assume full responsibility for managing the design, production
and support of the engine, which powers the Apache, EH101 Merlin
and NH90 helicopters. Rolls will progressively transfer its
operational responsibilities in the program to Turbomeca over
several years, the U.K. company said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
