Asia dollar-denominated bonds have
dropped below par for the first time since 2011 as investors
pull money out of the region amid concerns that growth is
slowing and as currencies from the rupee to rupiah plunge.  Average prices of company debentures in the region fell to
98.61 cents on the dollar on Aug. 22, the least since October
2011, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. Dollar bonds
globally have held above 100 cents since September 2009. Both
investment- and non-investment-grade debt in Asia were below par
on Aug. 22. The last time that happened was in September 2008,
when Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. collapsed.  Investor sentiment toward Asia is shifting as economic
growth in China slows and currencies in  India  and  Indonesia  --
the two countries with the biggest external funding needs in the
region -- plunge. About $44 billion has been pulled from
emerging-market stock and bond funds globally since the end of
May, data provider EPFR Global said on Aug. 23.  “You risk being swept away by fund outflows even if you
buy bonds from the best companies in Asia,” said Ben Bennett, a
global credit strategist in  London  at Legal & General Investment
Management, which manages $670 billion. “You’d need to be very
brave to add credit risk before currencies show signs of
stabilization.”  Rupee’s Decline  India’s rupee fell the most in 20 years last week as the
government said the nation’s economy expanded at the weakest
pace since 2009 last quarter, or 4.4 percent from a year
earlier. August was the worst month for Indonesia’s rupiah since
the global financial crisis.  Slowing economic growth is raising concern that Asian
companies will have a harder time servicing higher levels of
leverage after they boosted U.S. currency bond sales by 94
percent in 2012 to a record $124.7 billion.  Morgan Stanley predicted on Aug. 22 corporate defaults in
Asia excluding  Japan  will climb to 1.8 percent over the next 12
months from 0.8 percent in December, as three years of binge
borrowing saddles the region with the most indebted balance
sheets in the world.  Globally, about $20.5 billion has been withdrawn from
emerging-market bond funds since May 22, Cambridge,
Massachusetts-based EPFR said.  Fund Withdrawals  That was after Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
told Congress the central bank could cut back on the $85 billion
it is injecting into the financial system every month through
its purchases of Treasuries and mortgage bonds if U.S. economic
growth showed signs of being sustained. Emerging-market debt has
since lost  6.4 percent , according to Bloomberg’s USD Emerging
Market Corporate Bond Index.  Elsewhere in credit markets, the extra yield investors
demand to hold investment-grade corporate bonds globally rather
than government debentures widened for the second week. Global
bond sales increased for the first time in three weeks, capping
the slowest month for issuance this year. Loan prices declined
for a sixth week to complete the third monthly drop since April.  Relative yields on investment-grade bonds from the U.S. to
Europe and Asia expanded 1 basis point to 148 basis points, or
1.48 percentage points, according to the Bank of America Merrill
Lynch Global Corporate Index. Spreads narrowed 2 basis points
for the month as yields rose to 3.09 percent from 2.99 percent
on July 31.  Credit Benchmarks  The cost of protecting corporate bonds from default in the
U.S. jumped. The Markit CDX North American Investment Grade
Index, a credit-default swaps benchmark that investors use to
hedge against losses or to speculate on creditworthiness,
increased 5.5 basis points last week to a mid-price of 84.1
basis points, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The
measure rose 9.4 basis points in August, the biggest monthly
increase since May 2012.  The  Markit iTraxx Europe Index  of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings dropped 2.7 basis points to 104.5 at
10:55 a.m. in London. In the Asia-Pacific region, the Markit
iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade borrowers outside Japan
dropped 2 to 162.  The indexes typically rise as investor confidence
deteriorates and fall as it improves. Credit swaps pay the buyer
face value if a borrower fails to meet its obligations, less the
value of the defaulted debt. A basis point equals $1,000
annually on a swap protecting $10 million of debt.  Bond Returns  The  Bloomberg Global Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index (BCOR) 
declined 0.8 percent in August, bringing losses for the year to
3.3 percent.  Bonds of Fairfield, Connecticut-based  General Electric Co. (GE) 
were the most actively traded dollar-denominated corporate
securities by dealers last week, accounting for 3.3 percent of
the volume of dealer trades of $1 million or more, according to
Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority.  Orange SA (ORA) ,  France ’s largest phone company, and luxury
carmaker Bayerische Motoren Werke AG led $38.9 billion of
corporate bond sales worldwide last week, a 13 percent increase
from $34.5 billion in the period ended Aug. 23, Bloomberg data
show.  Paris-based Orange, previously known as France Telecom,
raised 1.5 billion euros in a two-part sale, including 850
million euros of 1.875 percent, five-year notes to yield 60
basis points more than the mid-swap rate. BMW’s 1.25 billion-euro offering included 750 million euros of 2 percent, seven-year bonds to yield 35 basis points more than swaps.  Leveraged Loans  The  S&P/LSTA U.S. Leveraged Loan 100 index  fell 0.02 cent
to 97.65 cents on the dollar last week, extending August’s slump
to 0.6 cent. The measure, which tracks the 100 largest dollar-denominated first-lien leveraged loans, reached a seven-week low
of 97.62 cents on Aug. 28. It has returned 2.97 percent this
year.  In  emerging markets , relative yields widened 11.6 basis
points last week to 375.1 basis points, according to  JPMorgan
Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global index.  The measure, which has expanded
from this year’s low of 245.4 on Jan. 3, jumped 32.1 basis
points in August.  Bond prices in Asia peaked this year on Jan. 15 at 108.39
cents on the dollar, a 14 percent rise from the trough in
October 2011. The rally owed its momentum to Operation Twist in
late September, a Fed program to lower long-term borrowing
costs.  Diminishing Role  As markets unraveled, bond prices slid below par on Aug.
22, the average yield rose to a 13-month high of 5.205 percent,
and spread widened to 358 basis points from January’s low of
273, according to Bank of America Corp. U.S. corporate debt
averaged 105.49 on Aug. 30 and yielded 3.46 percent.  Asia’s role as the world’s growth engine is diminishing as
economies from  China  to Malaysia and Indonesia cooled while
 Thailand  fell into a recession. The International Monetary Fund
in July cut its forecast for 2013 growth in developing Asia by
0.3 percentage point to 6.9 percent.  At the same time, the Federal Open Market Committee may
trim monthly bond purchases, which has benefited risky assets
globally as investors search for high yields, by $10 billion at
its meeting this month, and end the buying by mid-2014, based on
the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 48 economists
conducted Aug. 9-13. The FOMC next meets on Sept. 17-18.  Baidu Bonds  “There’s no question that if we see a September tapering,
there’ll be a market response and there’s going to be a lot of
short-term volatility on the back of that across all markets,”
Amanda Stitt, a London-based investment director at Legg Mason
Global Asset Management, said in an interview in  Singapore  on
Aug. 16. “Everything is taking direction from U.S. tapering
talk. It’s hard to pick the bottom.”  Bonds sold by  Baidu Inc. (BIDU) , the operator of China’s most
popular search engine, are among the casualties. Its $750
million of 3.5 percent notes due November 2022 have declined 7
percent this year to 90.86 cents on Aug. 30.  Losses accelerated in May as the price fell below par,
dipping to as low as 87.61 cents in June. The company is rated
A3, or four levels above junk, by Moody’s Investors Service.  PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara’s debt is trading below 70
cents on the dollar. The Jakarta-based state-owned power
utility’s $1 billion of 5.25 percent notes due October 2042 have
slumped 30 percent this year as the price slumped to 68.22 on
Aug. 28. The notes are rated Baa3, the lowest level of
investment grade at Moody’s.  Developed Markets  Asia’s troubles come at a time when investors are finding
comfort in developed markets, as the euro-area economy emerges
from the longest recession on record and growth in the world’s
biggest economy last quarter surpassed economists’ expectations.  “We’ve been more cautious about emerging-market risk for a
few months now and have been looking more toward improvements in
developed-market economies for opportunities,” Legal &
General’s Bennett said. “This is particularly the case in
Europe, with consumer-facing companies and even some of the
banks in a position to benefit from economic tail winds.”  Borrowers in Asia outside Japan have raised $94.5 billion
from dollar bond sales since Dec. 31, with 91 percent of that
amount issued in the first five months of the year, according to
Bloomberg-compiled data. As sentiment soured, 155 of the 186
securities were trading below their issue price as of Aug. 29.  “Risk appetite for Asian bonds is anemic at the moment,”
said Keith Chan, a Hong Kong-based credit analyst at HSBC
Holdings Plc. “Investors will most likely stay cautious until
we see some stability in the primary market and new deals begin
to perform in secondary trading.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
