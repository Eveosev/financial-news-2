South Africa ’s purchasing managers’
 index  unexpectedly rose to its highest level in six years in
August as a weaker rand makes manufactured-product exports more
attractive, Kagiso Tiso Holdings said.  The seasonally adjusted index climbed to 56.5 from 52.2 in
July, Johannesburg-based  Kagiso  said in an e-mailed statement
today. The index has been above 50, an indication of expansion
in factory output, for five months. The median estimate of four
economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for the index to drop to
51.5.  “We may be seeing the first signs of import replacement as
the weaker rand improves the competitiveness of locally-manufactured goods, versus more expensive imported goods,”
Kagiso said. “The sustained weakness in the currency has
improved the global competitiveness of our exports of
manufactured goods.”  The rand has dropped 17 percent against the dollar this
year, the worst performer among 16 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg and reached a four-year low of 10.5096 per dollar on
Aug. 28. Some exporters are already benefiting from the weaker
rand, Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in an interview on
Aug. 27.  The index measuring business activity rose 7.4 points to
59.2, Kagiso said. The new sales orders index climbed 2.5 points
to 57.5, while the purchasing commitments index gained 11.6
points to 54.4, it said.  The Bureau for  Economic Research , based at the University
of Stellenbosch near  Cape Town , conducts the PMI survey on
behalf of Kagiso.  To contact the reporter on this story:
