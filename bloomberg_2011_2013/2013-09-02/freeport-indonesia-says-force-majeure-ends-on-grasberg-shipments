Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX) 
ended force majeure on shipments from the Indonesian  copper mine 
at Grasberg, the world’s second largest, an executive said.  Shipments from Grasberg are at normal levels, Rozik B.
Soetjipto, the president-director at the company’s local unit,
said in a text message today. Phoenix-based Freeport has yet to
formally announce the lifting of the force majeure declared on
June 12, which allowed it to miss deliveries following a tunnel
accident. Freeport resumed some concentrate shipments in July.  The end of the halt at Grasberg will add to global supplies
at a time when prices are rising amid reports of stronger
manufacturing and lower copper stockpiles in China, the world’s
biggest consumer of the metal.  Copper for delivery in three months gained 1.6 percent to
$7,211 a metric ton as of 12:29 p.m. on the London Metal
Exchange. An official Chinese manufacturing gauge reached a 16-month high, and Bank of America Merrill Lynch said copper held
in bonded warehouses in  China  plunged.  Indonesia  ordered Freeport to suspend work at Grasberg
after a tunnel collapse on May 14 killed 28 workers. The
suspension reduced production by about 125 million pounds of
copper and 125,000 ounces of gold in the second quarter, the
company said in a statement on July 23.  The deposit at Grasbert, located in Papua province,
normally produces 220,000 tons of ore a day, Soetjipto said in
May.  To contact the reporters on this story:
