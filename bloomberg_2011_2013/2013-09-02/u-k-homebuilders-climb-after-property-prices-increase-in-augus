U.K. homebuilders gained in London
trading, led by  Barratt (BDEV)  Developments Plc,  Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS) 
and  Taylor Wimpey Plc (TW/) , after residential property prices in
England and Wales rose the most in about three years in August.  The Bloomberg U.K. Homebuilder Index of 10 stocks jumped
3.8 percent, the biggest increase since Aug. 16. Barratt, Bovis,
and Taylor Wimpey each gained 4.5 percent.  Persimmon Plc (PSN) , the
countryâ€™s biggest homebuilder by market value, added 4.2
percent.  Average house prices rose 1.8 percent in August from a year
earlier, the most since July 2010, London-based research firm
Hometrack Ltd. said in a report today. The market has benefited
from a government credit program called the Funding for Lending
Scheme. Lending rose by 1.6 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) in the
second quarter from the first three months of the year, the Bank
of England said today in a report on the program.  The U.K. Homebuilder Index has risen 42 percent this year,
while the benchmark FTSE 100 Index has gained 10 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
