Helvetia Holding AG (HELN) , Switzerland’s
No. 4 insurer, said first-half profit increased 15 percent,
boosted by life-insurance sales and an acquisition in  France .  Net income rose to 179.5 million Swiss francs ($193
million) in the six months through June from 156.7 million
francs a year earlier, the St. Gallen-based company said in an
e-mailed statement today. That beat the 164.4 million francs
average estimate of seven analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Helvetia, which generates more than half of its revenue in
Switzerland, last year acquired the transport insurance
portfolio of Groupama SA’s Gan Eurocourtage, making it France’s
second-biggest insurer for transport. Sales increased 5.5
percent to 4.78 billion francs in the first half, driven by life
insurance units  Switzerland , Germany and  Austria .  “Helvetia achieved profitable growth and raised its profit
and premium volume further,” Chief Executive Officer Stefan Loacker said in the statement. “We are confident that we are
ready for the future and will continue to strengthen our
competitive position in our markets.”  Helvetia said its ratio under the Swiss Solvency Test,
which was introduced in January 2011, was between 150 percent
and 200 percent, exceeding the limit of 100 percent. The rules
require insurers to provide a mark-to-market valuation of assets
and liabilities taking into account their investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
