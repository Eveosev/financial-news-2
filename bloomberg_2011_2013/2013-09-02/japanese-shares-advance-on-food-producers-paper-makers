Japanese  shares  rose, after the
 Topix (TPX)  index last week posted its fourth straight monthly loss,
as a weaker yen boosted carmakers and data signaled a recovery
in domestic  capital spending  and Chinese manufacturing.  Toyota Motor Corp.,  Asia ’s biggest automaker, gained 1
percent. Fanuc Corp., a producer of industrial robotics that
counts on Asia excluding  Japan  for half its revenue, climbed 2.7
percent after a gauge of China’s factory activity increased to a
16-month high. Consumer-finance company Aiful Corp. surged 18
percent on a report non-bank lending is recovering. Otsuka
Holdings Co. slid 2.4 percent after Citigroup Inc. cut its
 investment outlook  on the drugmaker.  The Topix added 1.1 percent to 1,117.78 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , with all but four of the 33 industry groups
advancing. The measure fell 2.3 percent in August, capping its
longest monthly losing streak since November 2008. The  Nikkei
225  increased 1.4 percent today to 13,572.92. Japan’s currency
weakened 0.8 percent to 98.93 against the greenback.  “The yen at the 98-per-dollar level today is positive for
stocks,” said  Masaru Hamasaki , a senior strategist at Tokyo-based Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management Co., which oversees about
11.2 trillion yen ($113 billion). “China’s PMI is also being
taken positively, although whether it can last is questionable.
Capital-spending data is supportive for an increase in Japan’s
economic growth outlook, so that’s also a plus.”  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed 0.7
percent today. The measure lost 0.3 percent on Aug. 30, capping
its worst monthly drop since May 2012, as investors weighed
prospects for a military response to an alleged chemical weapons
attack in Syria and a less-than-forecast rise in  consumer
spending . U.S. markets are closed today for a holiday.  China Manufacturing  The official  Purchasing Managers ’ Index of Chinese
manufacturing was at 51.0, beating analysts’ estimates. HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today released the final
reading of a similar private gauge showing a level of 50.1. A
reading above 50 denotes expansion.  Fanuc gained 2.7 percent to 15,420 yen. Komatsu Ltd., a
machinery manufacturer that gets about 8 percent of sales from
China, climbed 0.9 percent to 2,175 yen.  Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7011) , which counts on Asia excluding Japan for 16
percent of its revenue, rose 2.8 percent to 554 yen.  Best Performer  Even after falling 12 percent from this year’s May 22 peak,
Japanese equities are still the best performers in 2013 among
developed markets, amid optimism Prime Minister Abe and the  Bank
of Japan  can lead the country out of deflation through
unprecedented monetary easing and spur economic growth.  Capital spending in Japan was unchanged from a year earlier
in the second quarter, recovering from a 3.9 percent drop in the
first three months of the year, the  Finance Ministry  said today
in Tokyo. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg projected a 2.1 percent
decline.  JPMorgan Chase & Co. expects an upwards revision to Japan’s
gross domestic product in the period because of the better-than-expected data,  Masamichi Adachi , senior economist at the
investment bank, said by phone today.  Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s bid to raise the  sales tax  got
a boost as Economy Minister Akira Amari said on Aug. 31 a
majority of officials in seven consultative panels favored
proceeding with the increase in April.  The yen fell 0.8 percent to 98.93 per dollar today and
retreated against all of its major peers. Toyota, which gets 31
percent of sales from  North America , gained 1 percent to 6,000
yen. Honda Motor Co., which generates 83 percent of revenue
abroad, added 0.7 percent to 3,570 yen.  Consumer Lending  The Topix Other Financing Business Index of consumer-finance stocks rose the most among the Topix industry groups,
climbing 4.6 percent. Consumer lending will turn positive for
the first time in eight years amid increasing spending by
individuals, the Nikkei newspaper reported today. Japan’s top
three consumer lenders’ lending balance climbed to 1.9 trillion
yen at the end of June, the report said.  Aiful soared 18 percent, the most since April 8, to 963
yen. Acom Co., Japan’s second-biggest consumer-finance company
by market value, jumped 14 percent to 2,795 yen.  Among stocks that fell,  Otsuka Holdings (4578)  sank 2.4 percent to
2,973 yen, the biggest drop since Aug. 8. The company was cut to
neutral from buy at Citigroup, which also reduced its target
share price to 3,200 yen from 4,100 yen.  The Topix traded at 1.17 times book value today, compared
with 2.40 for the S&P 500 and 1.67 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index on Aug. 30. The Japanese gauge’s 30-day  historic
volatility  was at 26.84 today, compared with its five-year
