U.K. stocks  rose the most in eight
weeks as manufacturing expansion quickened in Britain and China,
and  Vodafone (VOD)  Group Plc rallied to an 11 1/2-year high.  Vodafone advanced 3.4 percent before Verizon Communications
Inc. agreed to buy out its stake in their wireless venture. Rio
Tinto Group and  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  climbed at least 3.9 percent.
Bovis Homes Group Plc led builders higher after data showed
house prices grew faster in August.  The  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  added 93.26 points, or 1.5 percent, to
6,506.19 at the close in London, for its biggest increase since
July 4. The benchmark gauge lost 3.1 percent last month on
concern the U.S. will take military action against  Syria . The
broader FTSE All-Share Index rose 1.5 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index advanced 1.4 percent.  “The Chinese and U.K. figures we had today -- and the form
of privatized quantitative easing we got with Vodafone -- have
meant that things should be relatively positive,” Justin Urquhart Stewart, who helps oversee about $6.8 billion at Seven
Investment Management in  London , said by telephone. “The
geopolitical issue has gone at least behind the clouds. It
hasn’t gone away, but people are focusing on the bigger picture
in terms of the global economy still slowly healing.”  The volume of shares traded in FTSE 100-listed companies
was 11 percent below the average of the last 30 days, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. Stocks slid last week amid
investor concern any military action by the U.S. against Syria
may escalate into a larger conflict in the Middle East and push
up oil prices.  Manufacturing Gauges  A U.K.  factory index  jumped to its highest level in 2 1/2
years, data showed today. Markit Economics and the Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply said the gauge climbed to
57.2 in August from a revised 54.8 in July. A reading above 50
indicates expansion. Economists in a Bloomberg survey had
forecast a reading of 55 from a previously reported 54.6.  In  China , a  measure of manufacturing  rose to 51 in August
from 50.3 in July. That exceeded the median economist estimate
in a Bloomberg survey for a reading of 50.6. Separate data
showed a purchasing managers’ index for manufacturing published
by Markit Economics and HSBC Holdings Plc increased to 50.1 last
month from 47.7 in July.  Vodafone gained 3.4 percent to 213.2 pence, its highest
price since December 2001. In a deal announced after the London
market closed, Verizon agreed to purchase Vodafone’s 45 percent
stake in Verizon Wireless. The $130 billion transaction gives
Verizon full control of the most profitable U.S. mobile-phone
carrier. The deal has been approved by both companies’ boards
and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2014,
according to a statement today.  Commodity Producers  A gauge of U.K. mining companies jumped 2.8 percent as the
price of copper and silver climbed. Rio Tinto jumped 4.2 percent
to 3,035 pence. Anglo American rallied 3.9 percent to 1,536
pence, while BHP Billiton Ltd. added 2.3 percent to 1,921 pence.  Bovis Homes Group Plc (BVS)  climbed 4.5 percent to 777 pence.
 Barratt Developments Plc (BDEV)  gained 4.5 percent to 317 pence.  Taylor
Wimpey Plc (TW/)  increased 4.5 percent to 103.9 pence.  Average  house values  in England and  Wales  rose 0.4 percent
after a 0.3 percent gain in July, property researcher Hometrack
said. Prices jumped 1.8 percent from a year earlier, the most
since July 2010.  Inmarsat Plc (ISAT)  climbed 5.4 percent to 732.5 pence, its
highest price since May 1. Morgan Stanley raised its
 recommendation  for the largest provider of maritime satellite
services to overweight, a rating similar to buy, from equal
weight. Inmarsat’s spectrum assets currently stuck with the
bankrupt LightSquared Inc. are undervalued, the brokerage said.
A potential bid for the U.S. company by Dish Network Corp. may
help LightSquared to resume payments to Inmarsat by April 2014,
Morgan Stanley said.  WPP Plc jumped 3.5 percent to 1,237 pence, the highest
price since March 2000. Deutsche Bank raised its rating of the
world’s largest advertising company to a buy from hold. WPP is
most likely to benefit in a changing advertising landscape that
faces increased competition from technology and opportunities
from a transition to the digital medium, according to analysts
Patrick Kirby and Matt Chesler.  Fresnillo Plc retreated 2.2 percent to 1,275 pence for the
biggest decline in the FTSE 100. The silver-and-gold producer
was cut to neutral from buy by UBS AG analyst Daniel Major, who
said the valuation looks less attractive after shares rallied 27
percent in August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
