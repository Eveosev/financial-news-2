Zambia’s statistics agency estimates
that a re-basing exercise later this year will show that the
country’s $20.7 billion economy is a fifth bigger than currently
measured as its  mining industry  has expanded.  Africa’s biggest copper producer has “completely” changed
structurally since 1994, the current base year used for
calculating the size of the economy, John Kalumbi, director at
the  Central Statistics Office , said yesterday by mobile phone
from Lusaka, the capital.  “The mining sector was in disarray at that time,”said
Kalumbi. “In the last three or four years the mining sector has
changed in terms of structure and contribution. There are other
sectors that have come on board in the last 10 years or so, and
these have also completely changed the structure of the
economy.”  Zambia began selling its copper mines to private investors
in the 1990s, reversing a nationalization program in the 1970s.
Production plunged to 263,000 metric tons in 1997 from 750,000
tons in 1973, according to the Chamber of Mines. The country has
benefited from growing private investment in mining, as well as
increased investment in agriculture, with GDP growing by 7.3
percent last year, according to the  World Bank .  The  Central Statistical Office  will re-base the coutry’s
GDP numbers once it has assessed the results of an economic
census in October, which will form the base of the exercise,
Kalumbi said.  “It will be in the range of 20 percent higher,” Kalumbi
said.  Zambia produced 818,000 metric tons of copper last year,
and this will grow to 1.1 million tons by 2015, Yamfwa Mukanga,
then minister of mines, said in April.  The southern African country re-based its currency, the
kwacha, at the start of this year, removing three zeros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
