U.S. companies, which have almost
doubled profits since the financial crisis, are losing the
benefit of record-low debt expenses as Federal Reserve plans to
taper bond purchases send borrowing costs higher.  Borrowing costs for Standard & Poor’s 500 Index companies
fell to 1.4 percent of sales the last 12 months, a record low in
11 years of data compiled by Bloomberg. While interest rates on
corporate bonds are below the 5.7 percent average since the
start of the financial crisis, yields are increasing the most
since 2009 and rose to about 4.3 percent from a 17-year low of
3.35 percent in May, as economists project the Fed will start
reducing economic stimulus this month.  Higher debt costs will reduce buybacks and dividend
increases that have boosted returns in the four-year bull
market, investors say. Companies that repurchased the most
shares or regularly increased payouts  beat  the benchmark for
U.S. equity by more than 27 percentage points since 2009. S&P
500 members returned $82.4 billion to shareholders in dividends
last quarter, up from $71.2 billion a year earlier, Bloomberg
data show.  “Part of the profitability story will start eroding,”
Paul Zemsky, the New York-based head of asset allocation for ING
Investment Management, which oversees $180 billion, said by
phone Aug. 28. “It’ll have more of an impact on financial
transactions, like buybacks and dividends.”  August Drop  Stocks dropped  last week , sending the S&P 500 down 1.8
percent to 1,632.97 and making August the worst month in more
than a year. Tensions rose over possible military action in
 Syria . Reports showing better-than-estimated  consumer confidence 
and economic growth added to speculation that quantitative
easing will end. The index climbed 0.4 percent to 1,639.77 at 4
p.m. New York time today.  Although the benchmark gauge is still up 15 percent in
2013, about $3 trillion was  erased  from global stock markets in
the six days after Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said June 19
that he may reduce bond purchases and halt the program by
mid-2014. The 10-year Treasury yield rose to a 22-month high of
2.66 percent on June 24 and stayed above 2.6 percent most of
last month.  The central bank will probably cut its $85 billion in
monthly bond purchases by $10 billion at its next meeting,
according to the median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 48
economists conducted Aug. 9-13.  Central bankers have kept the target rate for overnight
loans between banks near zero since 2008 to promote economic
growth, enticing companies from  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  to Home Depot Inc. to
sell bonds and use the money for share repurchases with their
stocks trading at some of the lowest valuations on record.  Debt Financed  Authorized U.S. buybacks reached a six-year high of $505
billion so far this year after more than $1.7 trillion of
repurchases since 2009, data from Birinyi Associates Inc. show.
The 100 stocks in the S&P 500 with the most buybacks relative to
market value have beaten the index since March 2009, advancing
236 percent compared with 141 percent for the benchmark, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Companies that have increased  dividends  every year for the
last 25 years rallied 169 percent in this bull market. The
dividend yield on the S&P 500 averaged 2.12 percent for the 12
months through May, about 0.38 percentage points higher than the
 10-year Treasury. (USGG10YR)  That relationship has shifted the last few
months, with bonds yielding 2.74 percent, compared to stocks at
2.14 percent.  Higher Rates  The average rate for high-yield and investment-grade U.S.
corporate debt surged almost a full percentage point from May to
June, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch index data.
Even with the jump to 4.3 percent, rates are below the average
of 6.9 percent in the decade before the start of the bull
market.  Buyback plans have slowed as the Fed prepares to curtail
the bond-buying program. Less than $50 billion was announced in
each of the past two months, compared to more than the $68
billion average of January through June, according to Birinyi
data. Repurchases dropped 3.2 percent to $118.5 billion in 2003,
the last year before the Fed started raising rates.  Corporate bond sales also have started to slow, after
reaching a global record of $3.99 trillion in 2012. After $1.1
trillion was issued in the first quarter this year, sales
slipped to $925.8 billion in the second, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. June’s $196.8 billion was the slowest month
since December 2011.  Earnings Slowdown  The rise in borrowing costs has little to do with corporate
credit quality as the economy, profits and margins improve.
 Earnings per share  for S&P 500 companies have surged to more
than $100 a share last year, compared to about $60 in 2008. One
reason is that net income has risen faster than sales, as
margins expanded for nine straight quarters from 2009 through
2011.  Falling debt costs are another reason. Interest expense for
companies in the S&P 500 totaled $128.2 billion in the last 12
months, or about 1.4 percent of sales, Bloomberg data show. That
compares with 2.4 percent in September 2012.  Profit expansion has slowed to an average 4.2 percent the
last six quarters, compared with the 28 percent mean during 2010
and 2011 when the economy was recovering for the global credit
crisis, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Now that profitability has been basically pushed up
toward peak levels, in order to get earnings to go higher from
here, who else are you going to fire? What else are you going to
cut?,” Kevin Caron, a Florham Park, New Jersey-based market
strategist at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which oversees about $150
billion, said by phone Aug. 29. “The trillion-dollar question
is what drives the rally from here?”  Better Investment  The Fed has committed to keeping rates low until the
economy is expanding fast enough on its own, saying it wouldn’t
raise rates so long as  unemployment  is above 6.5 percent and
inflation doesn’t exceed 2.5 percent.  Any rate increase would be a sign of improving confidence,
leading to more corporate investment, according to Jim Paulsen,
the Minneapolis-based chief investment strategist at Wells
Capital Management, which oversees about $340 billion. By the
time rates get back to normal, U.S. executives will want to
reinvest in their business instead of buying stock, he said.  Reports are showing faster improvement. Gross domestic
product expanded more than estimated in the second quarter and
initial jobless claims fell to the lowest level in five years.
Analysts project S&P 500 earnings will bounce back from the
slowdown, growing at 10.6 percent in 2014 and 2015, or twice the
pace of this year, according to more than 11,000 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Animal Spirits  “When the Fed starts raising rates, and suddenly all these
Armageddon stories are no longer Armageddons, that lends itself
to corporations acting with more animal spirits,” Paulsen said
by phone Aug. 28. “Bond yields would rise, but it would reflect
greater confidence in the economy so it would lead to an
acceleration of corporate activity into capital investment.”  Repurchases have been popular during this bull market
because  valuations  have been low relative to past rallies. While
price-earnings ratios for the S&P 500 rose 14 percent to 16
times earnings in the last 12 months, they have averaged 15.5
since March 2009, compared to the 18.8 mean in the 2002-2007
rally and 28.1 in the last two years of the 1990s, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Apple, based in Cupertino,  California , borrowed an
unprecedented $17 billion in its first bond sale since 1996 to
help fund a $55 billion addition to its capital return plan. The
offering was the largest bond sale on record and the first since
1996 for the world’s largest company by market value. While the
announcement helped the shares rally from the 2013 low, they
have underperformed the S&P 500 for this year.  Home Depot  Home Depot, the largest U.S. home-improvement retailer,
sold $2 billion of bonds in April for share repurchases. The
company boosted its dividend 34 percent and announced the $17
billion stock buyback in February. After outperforming the S&P
500 by 13 percentage points the first six months of the year,
the stock dropped 3.9 percent the last two months, while the
index is up 1.7 percent.  The most indebted companies in the S&P 500, which had
beaten the index by 6 percentage points through May, are
starting to lag behind. In the last three months they have
declined 3 percent, compared with a 0.1 percent gain in the
gauge, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Corporate executives should have locked in record-low
borrowing costs by now, according to Mark Luschini, the
Philadelphia-based chief investment strategist at Janney
Montgomery Scott LLC, which oversees about $58 billion of
assets, said by phone Aug. 30.  “If they haven’t taken advantage of this window of low
rates already,” he said, “then shame on them.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
