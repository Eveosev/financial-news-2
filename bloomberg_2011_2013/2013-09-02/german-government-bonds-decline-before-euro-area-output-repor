German 10-year government bonds fell
the most in more than a week as surveys of purchasing managers
in  China  and the euro area showed  manufacturing  increased last
month, reducing demand for the safest fixed-income assets.  French  10-year yields  climbed to a 10-week high as U.S.
President  Barack Obama  delayed military action against Syria by
seeking approval from Congress. The yields on Austrian, Belgian
and Dutch securities also increased as data showed manufacturing
in the euro region expanded at a faster pace than initially
estimated in August, while Spanish bonds advanced. U.S. markets
are closed today for the Labor Day holiday.  “The Chinese official PMI manufacturing index surprised on
the upside,” said  Nick Stamenkovic , an Edinburgh-based
strategist at RIA Capital Markets Ltd. “Combined with easing
fears of an imminent or early U.S.-led military strike in Syria,
the safe-haven flows into bunds started to unwind and bunds have
sold off.”  Germany ’s 10-year bund yield climbed five basis points, or
0.05 percentage point, to 1.90 percent at 4:22 p.m. London time.
That’s the biggest increase since Aug. 22. The 1.5 percent
security due in May 2023 fell 0.415, or 4.15 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,319) face amount, to 96.45. The rate on the nation’s
two-year note increased three basis points to 0.26 percent.  Chinese Output  An official Chinese  Purchasing Managers ’ Index jumped more
than estimated to a 16-month high of 51, a government report
showed yesterday in Beijing. A separate PMI released today by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics advanced to 50.1 last
month from 47.7 in July, the largest gain since 2010. Readings
above 50 signal expansion.  An index based on a survey of euro-region purchasing
managers in the  manufacturing  industry increased to 51.4 from
50.3 in July, London-based Markit Economics said. That’s above
an estimate of 51.3 published on Aug. 22, and the highest
reading since June 2011.  French 10-year yields advanced three basis points to 2.50
percent after touching 2.53 percent, the  most  since June 24. The
rate on similar-maturity Austrian bonds gained four basis points
to 2.34 percent. The 10-year Belgian yield rose three basis
points to 2.78 percent, and Dutch 10-year yields increased three
basis points, to 2.32 percent.  Obama’s administration is trying to persuade U.S. lawmakers
over the next week that a military strike against  Syria  is
justified and in the nation’s vital interest. Congress is
scheduled to reconvene on Sept. 9.  Spanish Manufacturing  A gauge showed Spanish manufacturing expanded in August for
the first time in more than two years, rising to 51.1 from 49.8
a month earlier, according a separate Markit report. Italy’s
factory-output  index  climbed to 51.3, the fastest pace since May
2011, Markit said.  The yield on  Spain ’s 10-year bond fell 10 basis points to
4.44 percent, while the rate on similar-maturity Italian
securities dropped five basis points to 4.36 percent.  Italian Prime Minister Enrico Letta’s strained ruling
coalition last week passed amendments to an unpopular property
tax, helping to ease tensions with  Silvio Berlusconi , leader of
the second-biggest party, who had opposed the levy.  “The Italian PMI indicator at 51.3 was stronger than
expected, leading to a rally in the domestic bond” market,
London-based Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Silvia Ardagna
wrote in an e-mailed note. “Supportive macro data and a less
tense political environment are benefiting our trade
recommendation to be long 10-year Italian BTPs and short 10-year
French government bonds.” A short position is a bet an asset’s
value will fall.  Bond Movers  Volatility on Finnish bonds was the highest in euro-area
markets today followed by those of Germany and Spain, according
to measures of 10-year debt, the yield spread between two- and
10-year securities, and credit-default swaps.  Finland ’s 10-year bond yield gained four basis points to
2.18 percent.  Greece ’s  government bonds  were little changed after Dutch
Finance Minister Jeroen Dijsselbloem said possible new aid to
the indebted nation, to be decided in the course of 2014, would
be conditional. He commented in a letter to parliament. The rate
on Greek 10-year bonds was at 10.30 percent.  German bonds lost 2.2 percent this year through Aug. 30,
according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes. Italian securities
returned 3.6 percent, while Spain’s earned 7.4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
