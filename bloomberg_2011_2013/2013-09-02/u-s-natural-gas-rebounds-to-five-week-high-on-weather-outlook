Natural gas futures rose for the
fifth time in six days in  New York  amid speculation that warmer
weather will increase demand for the fuel from power stations.  Futures gained as much as 3 percent in electronic trading,
the highest intraday level since July 25. The western half of
the U.S. will experience warmer-than-normal temperatures from
Sept. 2 to Sept. 11, according to data from the  website  of
AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,  Pennsylvania . Power
generation accounts for about 32 percent of U.S. gas demand.  “Weather in the northern part of the U.S. is very warm,
thus gas demand for electricity is also very strong,” said
 Stephen Schork , the president of Schork Group Inc., a consultant
in Villanova, Pennsylvania. “A lot of speculative money moved
to the sidelines this summer and it looks like that money could
be coming back into the market.”  The October contract increased 8.1 cents, or 2.3 percent,
to $3.662 at the 1:15 p.m. close of electronic trading on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange , on volume that was 88 percent
below the 100-day average. There was no floor trading or
settlement price because of the U.S. Labor Day holiday.
Electronic trading will resume at 6 p.m.  The contract had declined 1 percent to settle at $3.581
Aug. 30, trimming the first monthly gain since April to 3.9
percent.  The discount of October to November futures narrowed 0.4
cent to 9.9 cents. October gas traded 35.9 cents below the
January contract, compared with 34.5 cents Aug. 30.  Gas inventories totaled 3.13 trillion cubic feet in the
week ended Aug. 23, 1.5 percent above the five-year average and
7 percent below last year’s supplies, Energy Information
Administration data show.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
fell by seven this week to 380, according to a report Aug. 30
from  Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)  in Houston. The total has declined 12
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
