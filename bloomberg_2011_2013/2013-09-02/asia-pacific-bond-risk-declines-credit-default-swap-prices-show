The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds in the Asia-Pacific region against non-payment
fell, according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  dropped 2 basis points to 162 basis
points as of 8:59 a.m. in  Singapore ,  Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  prices show. The gauge rose 16.9 basis points
last month, the most since June, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index decreased 1 basis point
to 124 as of 10:57 a.m. in Sydney, according to ANZ prices. The
measure, which advanced 1.2 basis points last month, is poised
for its lowest close since Aug. 26, according to CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the private market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index declined 0.5 of a basis point
to 94 basis points as of 9:36 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to
Citigroup Inc. prices. The gauge is poised for its lowest close
since Aug. 15, according to CMA.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
