The ruble slipped to the lowest in
more than a year after Russian manufacturers reported worsening
conditions and oil declined for a third day. Russian  stock
futures  rose.  The Russian currency lost 0.1 percent to 33.345 per dollar,
the weakest since June 2012, on its sixth day of declines. Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to expectations of
currency movements, showed the ruble at 33.854 per dollar in
three months. Futures expiring this month on the dollar-denominated  RTS equity index  advanced 0.3 percent during  New
York  hours yesterday after the Micex Index climbed 0.2 percent
in Moscow. U.S. markets were closed for the Labor Day holiday.  Russian manufacturing contracted for a second month in
August, falling short of economists’ estimates, according to the
HSBC Manufacturing PMI report published by  Markit Economics 
yesterday. Oil prices slipped for a third day after President
 Barack Obama  said he’ll seek approval from Congress before
taking military action in  Syria , easing concern that an imminent
strike may disrupt Middle East oil exports.  “The Russian macro picture remains bleak with the
manufacturing PMI for August,” Slava Smolyaninov, a strategist
at UralSib Capital in Moscow, said by e-mail. “Oil is not
supporting the Russian stocks either as the threat of an
imminent military strike on Syria has been removed.”  Oil and natural gas contribute about 50 percent of Russian
government revenue. Crude futures fell 0.8 percent to $106.82 a
barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange
after sinking as much as 3.2 percent. Brent crude for October
settlement on the ICE Futures Europe exchange added 0.3 percent
to $114.33 a barrel and Urals crude,  Russia ’s chief export
blend, rose 0.1 percent to $108.98.  RTS futures advanced to 129,380 while the 50-stock Micex
gauge rose to 1,367.53.  The ruble slipped 0.1 percent to 38.1623 against the basket
used by Russia’s central bank to manage swings in the currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
