Egypt  will offer 2 billion Egyptian
pounds ($328 million) of  three-year treasury bonds  today as the
Muslim Brotherhood threw its support behind loan negotiations
with the  International Monetary Fund . The dollar bonds rose.  The North African country last sold similar-maturity notes
at 16.21 percent on Aug. 16, according to central bank data on
Bloomberg. The sale is part of a plan to raise a record 175
billion pounds this quarter.  The Brotherhood’s political arm, the Freedom and Justice
Party, “understands the importance of the agreement with the
IMF on the international level, and how it boosts” confidence,
the group said in a statement posted on its  Facebook page . Egypt
is negotiating with the fund for as much as $4.8 billion in aid
to help bridge its  budget deficit  and jump-start economic
growth. The party is the country’s biggest.  The  government has raised  about 94 percent of the 121
billion pounds it has offered in securities since the start of
the quarter as it tries to control yields. All debt sales in the
period have received more bids than the amounts offered,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg.  The nation’s 5.75 percent dollar bonds due in 2020 advanced
for an eighth day, pushing the yield down three basis points, or
0.03 of a percentage point, to 5.46 percent at 10:38 a.m. in
Cairo, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the
lowest level on a closing basis since September 2011.  The pound, subject to a managed float, weakened 0.1 percent
to 6.0917 a dollar, near the lowest level since December 2004.  To contact the reporter on this story:
