Gulf Air, Bahrain’s state-owned
airline, said it achieved cost savings of 6.8 million dinars
($18 million) in the five months through May as the financially
troubled carrier works to become profitable.  Gulf Air plans a further 15 percent reduction in its cost
base for 2012, Chief Executive Officer Samer Al Majali said in a
statement today, reiterating an earlier target. First-half
revenue rose 6 percent while the number of passengers carried
increased 13 percent, the Manama-based airline said, without
specifying numbers.  “The combined efforts of rationalized route network, fleet
optimization, improved sales efficiency, products and services,
cost efficiency measures and expenditure reduction” produced
the results, Al Majali said. “This is by no means a small
achievement, considering factors such as the temporary
suspension of eight profitable routes and high fuel prices that
have had a negative impact on our traffic and revenue.”  Gulf Air, which has estimated that it saved 25.5 million
dinars in costs last year, dropped four routes in March in an
effort to reduce spending. Bahrain’s cabinet said on July 8 that
it will support national carriers to help them meet operational
goals and compete in the region and internationally. The
government was responding to a parliamentary committee’s
decision against allocating more money to Gulf Air.  The state-owned carrier and privately held Bahrain Air are
the only two airlines based in the Persian Gulf island kingdom.  To contact the reporter on this story:
