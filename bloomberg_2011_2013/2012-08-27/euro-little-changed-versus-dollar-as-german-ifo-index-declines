The euro stayed little changed
against the dollar after the Ifo institute in Munich said its
business climate index dropped for a fourth straight month in
August to its lowest reading since March 2010.  The 17-nation currency was at $1.2523 at 9:04 a.m. London
time, from $1.2512 on Aug. 24. It was at 98.52 yen from 98.44.  To contact the reporter on this story:
