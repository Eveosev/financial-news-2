The port of Paranagua in southern
 Brazil  had 21 ships pass without docking because they are
waiting for the country’s winter harvest to be completed.  A drop in U.S. corn production because of dry weather
prompted ships to wait for Brazil’s record harvest, the port’s
superintendent Luiz Henrique Dividino said today in a phone
interview from Paranagua.  “I’ve never seen such a situation in over 20 years working
with ports,” Dividino said.  Dividino said that with the winter corn season harvest
getting to the final stages, the ships will have enough to load.
“We will see the peak of corn exports through the next 30
days,” Dividino said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
