Cattle futures declined for the
second straight session on signs of increasing U.S. beef
supplies. Hog prices rose.  On Aug. 24, wholesale  beef  fell the most in five weeks, and
meatpackers processed 653,000 cattle last week, up 1.6 percent
from a week earlier, U.S. Department of Agriculture data show.
Farmers are doing “the reverse” of expansion, liquidating
older cows and unproductive animals amid high feed costs, said
 Dennis Smith , an analyst at Archer Financial Services.  “The beef is topping off,” Smith said in a telephone
interview from Chicago. “I expect pressure in beef in cash and
futures.”  Cattle futures for October delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$1.2405 a pound at 10:03 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Through Aug. 24, the price gained 2.5 percent this
year.  On Aug. 24, wholesale beef fell 0.9 percent to $1.9214 a
pound, the biggest decline since July 19, the latest USDA data
show.  More than 35 percent of the Midwest was in extreme  drought 
as of Aug. 21, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor. Corn, the
main ingredient in livestock feed, surged 60 percent from June
15 through Aug. 24 on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement dropped 0.2
percent to $1.44175 a pound on the CME.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.3 percent to
72.575 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
