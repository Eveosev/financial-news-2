Malaysia’s ringgit fell, extending
its retreat from a three-month high, as concern Europe’s
financial crisis will worsen damped demand for riskier assets.  A proposed new wave of sovereign bond purchases by the
 European Central Bank  may increase government reliance on such
funding and won’t help solve the euro-area debt crisis,
Germany’s Der Spiegel cited Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann
as saying in an interview yesterday. Euro leaders are preparing
for a critical month in the three-year-old regional crisis that
will involve the formulation of an ECB bond-buying plan and a
progress report by Greece’s international creditors.  “Weidmann criticized the ECB’s bond-buying plan and we’re
still waiting for the troika of creditors’ assessment of
Greece’s progress, so there’s still a lot of uncertainties,”
said  Nizam Idris , head of Asian fixed income and currencies at
Macquarie Bank Ltd. in Singapore. “This is holding back Asian
currencies.”  The ringgit declined 0.3 percent to 3.1095 per dollar as of
4:48 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur , after sliding 0.5 percent on Aug. 24,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It touched 3.0840 on
Aug. 23, the strongest level since May 16. One-month implied
volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price
options, was steady at 6.90 percent.  Government bonds  fell. The yield on the 3.314 percent notes
due October 2017 rose two basis points, or 0.02 percentage
point, to 3.27 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
