The Polish zloty advanced,
rebounding after its biggest weekly decline in almost three
months, amid speculation policy makers will take steps to
support economies worldwide.  The zloty appreciated 0.4 percent to 4.0771 per euro as of
1:32 p.m. in Warsaw for the second-steepest gain among more than
20 emerging-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg. It lost 0.6
percent last week, the steepest weekly drop since the period
ended June 1.  European Central Bank President  Mario Draghi  may provide
further hints on policy when he speaks at the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Sept. 1.
Fed Bank of Chicago President  Charles Evans  urged the central
bank to begin a third round of bond purchases in a speech in
Hong Kong today. China’s Premier  Wen Jiabao  called for extra
measures to support exports and help meet economic targets,
Xinhua News Agency said Aug. 25.  “The zloty may appreciate in the first half of the week
toward” 4.05 per euro “supported by expectations for more
actions from the ECB and the Fed,”  Grzegorz Maliszewski , chief
economist at Bank Millennium SA in Warsaw, wrote in a note to
clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
