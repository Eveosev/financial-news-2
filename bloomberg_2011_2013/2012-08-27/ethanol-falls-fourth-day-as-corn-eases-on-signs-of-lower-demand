Ethanol futures fell a fourth day in
Chicago as corn prices eased on signs of slowing global demand
for the grain.  Prices extended the longest streak of losses in a month
after the Agriculture Department said  corn supplies inspected
for export  in the week ended Aug. 23 fell 52 percent from a year
earlier to the lowest since July 2003. Lower prices for the
grain reduce costs to manufacture ethanol, as one bushel makes
at least 2.75 gallons of the biofuel.  “The grains came down and as it stands the market looks
weak,” said  Dan Flynn , a trader at Price Futures Group in
Chicago.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 1.5 cents, or
0.6 percent, to $2.586 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest settlement since Aug. 14, extending the longest band
of declines since the period ended July 26. Prices have gained
17 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago gained 1 cent,
or 0.4 percent, to $2.625 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the
additive increased 1 cent, or 0.4 percent, to $2.685, data
compiled by Bloomberg shows.  Ethanol on the West Coast slipped 1 cent, or 0.4 percent,
to $2.74 a gallon and in  New York  the biofuel dropped 0.5 cent
to $2.675.  Corn for December delivery dropped 7.75 cents, or 1
percent, to $8.0075 a bushel in Chicago. Ethanol has traded in
the same direction of corn each of the last six sessions.  Gasoline for September delivery surged 7.68 cents, or 2.5
percent, to $3.1548 a gallon on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , the highest price since April 30.  Discount to Gasoline  Ethanol’s discount to gasoline expanded 19 percent to about
57 cents, the steepest since June 19, based on the September
contracts for both fuels.  Refiners, required by the U.S. to blend about 13.2 billion
gallons of ethanol into gasoline this year, may use more than
the government requires as they stand to pocket the difference
between the two fuels.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, fell 1.4 percent to 3.65 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. They are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
