Curtis Granderson  hit his 200th
career home run as the  New York Yankees  beat the Cleveland
Indians 4-2 in the finale of their six-game road trip.  Nick Swisher  and Ichiro Suzuki added run-scoring singles
for the Yankees (74-53), who pushed their lead in the American
League Eastern Division to four games over the Tampa Bay Rays.  The Yankees open a six-game homestand today with the first
of three games against the Toronto Blue Jays.  The Rays were off yesterday, while the Baltimore Orioles,
who are 4 1/2 games back in the AL East, had their scheduled
game against the Blue Jays rained out.  The Washington Nationals’ losing streak hit four games with
a 4-1 defeat against the Philadelphia Phillies. The Nationals
still have the best record in Major League Baseball at 77-50 and
lead the National League East by 4 1/2 games over the Atlanta
Braves, who beat the San Francisco Giants 7-1.  The Giants still have a two-game NL West against the Los
Angeles Dodgers, who lost to the Miami Marlins 6-2.  The St. Louis Cardinals pulled within six games of
Cincinnati in the NL Central with a 8-2 win over the Reds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
