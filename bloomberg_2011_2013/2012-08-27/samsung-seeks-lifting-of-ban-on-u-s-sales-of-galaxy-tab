Samsung Electronics Co. (005930) , ordered by
a U.S. jury to pay Apple Inc. more than $1 billion for
infringing six mobile device patents, asked a judge to lift a
ban on the U.S. sales of the Galaxy 10.1 tablet computer.  The jury decided the Galaxy device didn’t infringe an Apple
patent so the preliminary ban on its sale should be dissolved,
Samsung said in a filing yesterday in federal court in  San Jose ,
 California .  Samsung fell the most in almost four years in Seoul trading
today after the Aug. 24 decision by the San Jose jury. The South
Korean company said in June, when Cupertino, California-based
Apple won the ban on U.S. sales of the Galaxy tablet, that it
wouldn’t have a significant impact on its business.  The Suwon, South Korea-based company said in yesterday’s
filing that it’s entitled to recover damages caused by the
imposition of the improper ban on the sales of the tablet.
Samsung proposed that U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh rule on the
request without a hearing.  The case is  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  v. Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., 11-
cv-01846, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California
(San Jose).  To contact the reporter on this story:
