France  called on the Syrian
opposition to form a provisional government to prepare for the
demise of Bashar al-Assad’s regime as fighting intensified in
the civil conflict.  “France asks the Syrian opposition to constitute a
provisional government that is inclusive, representative, that
can become the legitimate representative of the new  Syria ,”
French President  Francois Hollande  said today in a speech in
Paris to his nation’s ambassadors. “France would recognize the
provisional government once it has been formed.”  Hollande turned up the pressure on Assad amid escalating
violence. Syrian rebels said today they shot down a government
helicopter over the capital Damascus. Aug. 25 was the bloodiest
day since the uprising began 17 months ago, with 440 people
reported dead by the opposition Local Coordination Committees.
More than 23,000 lives have been lost, the U.K.-based Syrian
Observatory for Human Rights estimates.  Hollande said he favors establishing liberated zones in
Syria and that the opposition there should form a transitional
government. He said France is working with Arab governments to
prepare the shadow Syrian government.  Separately, he said it is “unacceptable” that  Iran 
develop nuclear weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
