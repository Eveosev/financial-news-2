Half of the expected voters in
 Burkina Faso  didn’t register for legislative and municipal
elections scheduled for December, with no plan in place to
enroll them, said Boris Edson Yameogo, spokesman for the
country’s electoral commission.  Four million people signed up in the registration period
from June 1 to yesterday, less than the 8 million expected, he
said by phone today from Ouagadougou, the capital. The
commission will check for double registrations and give a
“definitive list” by the end of September, Yameogo said.  The annual rainy season may have prevented many people from
being able to register, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
