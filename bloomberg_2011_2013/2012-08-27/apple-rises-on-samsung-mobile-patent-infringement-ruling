Apple Inc. (AAPL)  climbed 1.9 percent to
close at a record high after a U.S. jury found that Samsung
Electronics Co. infringed on six of its mobile-device patents.  The shares of Cupertino, California-based Apple rose to
$675.68 at the close in New York. Apple has gained 67 percent
this year.  A California court on Aug. 24 ruled that Suwon, South
Korea-based Samsung must pay more than $1.05 billion in damages
in the first lawsuit between the dominant global smartphone
rivals to go before a U.S. jury.  A judge scheduled a hearing next month to consider Apple’s
request for a permanent U.S. sales ban on devices such as the
Galaxy S and S II smartphones and the Galaxy Tab 10.1 computer.
A ban may undermine Samsung’s grip on a smartphone market valued
at $219.1 billion by Bloomberg Industries and set a precedent
for rival handset makers that use Google Inc.’s Android
operating system.  In a court filing today, Apple sought a ban on eight models
of Samsung’s smartphones, including several of its Galaxy S
devices.  To contact the reporter on this story:
