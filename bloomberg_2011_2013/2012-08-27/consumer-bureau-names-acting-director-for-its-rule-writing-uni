The U.S. Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau named Kelly Thompson Cochran, formerly a
lawyer with Wilmer Cutler Pickering Hale & Dorr LLP, to serve as
the agency’s acting assistant director for regulations.  Cochran, who worked as the bureau’s deputy assistant
director for regulations after joining from the Treasury
Department, will replace Leonard Chanin, who left last week to
join law firm  Morrison & Foerster LLP . The consumer agency
announced Cochran’s appointment in a statement today.  Stephen Van Meter will be deputy general counsel, having
previously been assistant general counsel for policy, the bureau
said in its statement. Meredith Fuchs became general counsel of
CFPB in June after Leonard Kennedy became an adviser to consumer
bureau Director  Richard Cordray .  The bureau also announced that Chris Lipsett will join from
Wilmer Hale to become senior counsel in Cordray’s office and
Delicia Reynolds Hand will serve as staff director for the
consumer advisory board and councils.  “I am pleased to announce these new additions and updates
to the CFPB leadership team,” Cordray said in the statement.
“We look forward to welcoming them as we continue to work on
behalf of the American consumer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
