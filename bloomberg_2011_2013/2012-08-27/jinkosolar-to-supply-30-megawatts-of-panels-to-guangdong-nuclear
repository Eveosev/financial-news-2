JinkoSolar Holding Co. (JKS) , a Chinese
solar manufacturer, rose the most in more than six months after
it agreed to supply China Guangdong Nuclear Power Holding Corp.
with panels for a 30-megawatt project.  JinkoSolar’s American depositary receipts rose 16 percent
to $3.32 at the close in New York, the most since Feb. 9. Each
ADR is worth four ordinary shares.  The company didn’t disclose terms of the deal or
construction dates for the project in a statement today. China
Guangdong is planning the solar farm in the city of Hami in the
Xinjiang Uyghur autonomous region.  JinkoSolar, whose ADRs have fallen 34 percent this year,
has capacity to produce about 1,200 megawatts of solar panels a
year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
