France’s government will examine
 Carrefour SA (CA) ’s job-cuts plan and the financial situation at the
company, Industry Minister  Arnaud Montebourg  said on BFM TV
yesterday.  Carrefour may announce 500 job cuts on Wednesday, the
French daily Le Figaro reported on Aug. 25.  “We’re going to examine this company as we have others,”
Montebourg said. “We are going to look the company’s
profitability and the reasons why it’s in this situation.”  Montebourg called the examination part of the “usual
process” when job-cut plans are announced.  To contact the reporter on this story:
