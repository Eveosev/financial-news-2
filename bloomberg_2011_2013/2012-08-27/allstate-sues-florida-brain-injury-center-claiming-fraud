Allstate Corp. (ALL) , the second-largest
U.S. auto insurer, is seeking fraud damages in a lawsuit
alleging that a Florida brain-injury facility warehoused
patients who were beaten and abused by staff.  The suit, filed Friday in U.S. District Court in Tampa,
seeks $7.6 million that the insurer says it paid the Florida
Institute for Neurologic Rehabilitation to treat its claimants,
as well as triple damages under federal racketeering laws and
other costs.  Allstate alleges patients from  Michigan , which mandates
unlimited lifetime medical benefits for automobile injury
coverage, were recruited to the Florida facility through an
aggressive marketing campaign that promised an array of
services that were never provided.  Wayne J. Miller, an attorney representing the facility,
known as FINR, said the company would not comment on matters in
litigation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
