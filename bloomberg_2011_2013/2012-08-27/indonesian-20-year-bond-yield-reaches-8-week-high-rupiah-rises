Indonesia ’s 20-year bonds fell,
sending the yield to an eight-week high, after global funds
reduced their holdings on concern the local currency will weaken
due to a growing current-account shortfall. The rupiah advanced.  Overseas investors cut ownership of government debt by  2.5
trillion rupiah  ($263 million) on Aug. 23, the most since
September, according to data from the  finance ministry . The
current-account deficit rose to $6.9 billion in the second
quarter from $3.2 billion in the three months ended March, the
central bank reported Aug. 10.  Bank Indonesia  raised the rate it
pays on interbank deposits to 4 percent this month, narrowing
the gap with the benchmark 5.75 percent reference rate.  “The  currency risk  is still high due to the current-
account deficit, so we have seen foreign investors begin to step
out,” said Handy Yunianto, head of fixed-income research at PT
Mandiri Sekuritas. “Domestic banks are buying bonds less
aggressively because of the rise in the deposit rate.”  The yield on the 8.25 percent bonds due June 2032 climbed
nine basis points, or 0.09 percentage point, to 6.83 percent,
the highest level since July 2, according to closing prices from
the Inter Dealer Market Association. The yield has increased 34
basis points since Aug. 10 when the central bank raised the
bottom end of its deposit facility to 4 percent from 3.75
percent.  The rupiah advanced 0.1 percent to 9,515 per dollar as of
4:18 p.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. It reached 9,540 on July 27, the weakest
level in eight weeks. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, was
unchanged at 6.8 percent.  Bank Indonesia expects the rupiah to trade within its
current range even without intervention as the currency has
begun to enter a “new equilibrium,” Governor  Darmin Nasution 
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
