Natural gas rose from the lowest
level in two months in  New York  as Tropical Storm Isaac shut
production in the Gulf of Mexico.  Futures advanced as much as 2.4 percent after Isaac moved
into the southeast Gulf and was forecast to strengthen into a
hurricane. Offshore operators evacuated platforms and rigs in
the storm’s path, shutting in about 8.2 percent of the region’s
gas production and 24 percent of its oil output, the Bureau of
Safety and Environmental Enforcement said  yesterday .  Gas for September delivery increased as much as 6.6 cents
to $2.768 per million British thermal units on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange  and was at $2.754 at 10:34 a.m. Singapore
time. Prices fell 10 cents to $2.702 per million Btu on Aug. 24,
the lowest settlement since June 25.  Isaac is expected to move over the eastern part of the Gulf
of Mexico today before approaching the northern Gulf Coast
tomorrow, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in an  advisory 
released just before 8 p.m. New York time yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
