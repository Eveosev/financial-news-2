Romania ’s governing coalition lost
public support after a failed attempt to oust suspended
President Traian Basescu because of a low turnout at a
nationwide referendum on July 29, a survey showed.  The Social Democrats and the Liberals, which now form the
Social-Liberal Union and will run together in parliamentary
elections later this year, would win 54 percent of the votes if
an election were held now, according to an Aug. 22 survey by
polling company IRES,  Evenimentul Zilei  newspaper reported. That
compares with 61.4 percent in an IMAS poll published on Aug. 9.  The  Liberal Democratic Party , which backs Basescu, would
win 23 percent up from 16.3 percent of votes, in the previous
poll, the survey of 1,547 people showed. It had a error margin
of 2.7 percentage points. The new  People’s Party , founded by
media owner Dan Diaconescu, would get 10 percent, the same as in
the previous poll.  A political feud between Prime Minister Victor Ponta and
Basescu, which led to the president’s suspension on July 6, may
continue as the  Constitutional Court  invalidated an ouster
referendum, allowing Basescu to return to his office. The power
struggle pushed the currency to a record low and boosted the
government’s borrowing costs.  Romania will probably hold parliamentary elections on Dec.
2, Mircea Dusa, the minister in charge of relations with
parliament, told private television station Realitatea TV. The
opposition Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, an ethnic
minority party, would get 5 percent down from 6.2 percent,
according to the survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
