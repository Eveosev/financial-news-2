For the first time this year,
slowing growth in oil demand is spurring analysts to cut
estimates for earnings in the tanker industry’s largest vessels.  Rates for very large crude carriers, each hauling 2 million
barrels, will average $21,250 a day in 2012, 5.6 percent less
than previously forecast, based on the median of 12 estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Frontline Ltd., the biggest operator,
will report a second consecutive  annual loss  and shares of the
Hamilton, Bermuda-based company will drop 27 percent in 12
months, the average of as many as 18 analyst predictions shows.  The  International Energy Agency , an adviser to 28 nations,
reduced its oil-demand forecast on Aug. 10 and predicted slower
growth in 2013. Stockpiles in the U.S., the biggest importer,
are already near a 22-year high, Energy Department data show.
Slower growth will worsen the glut in shipping, with the VLCC
fleet projected to expand 6.9 percent in 2012, according to
Clarkson Plc. The world’s biggest shipbroker anticipates demand
for the vessels will rise 3.9 percent.  “The modest increase in oil consumption is not going to be
enough to turn the crude-tanker market around,” said Martin Korsvold, an analyst at Pareto Securities AS in Oslo, whose
recommendations on shipping equities returned 30 percent in the
past two years. “We don’t think tanker operators are going to
get any material relief until 2014.”  Annual Average  VLCC earnings plunged 73 percent to $8,191 since the start
of January and averaged $31,127 so far this year, Clarkson data
show. Rates are volatile, moving 29 percent or more in five of
the past seven months. The annual average predicted by the
analysts would be the lowest since 1999 and below the $24,100
that Frontline says it needs to break even.  Frontline, founded by billionaire  John Fredriksen , will
narrow its loss to $21.76 million this year, from $529.6 million
in 2011, the mean of 16 estimates shows.  Overseas Shipholding
Group (OSG)  Inc., the largest U.S. tanker company, said in a filing
Aug. 7 it will be about $100 million short of the funds it needs
to repay $1.5 billion of loans by February. The New York-based
company has reported 13 consecutive quarterly losses.  Shares of Frontline, which operates 42 VLCCs, dropped 13
percent to 22.09 kroner in Oslo trading this year and are
predicted to reach 16.11 kroner in 12 months, based on the
median of 18 estimates. Oil fell 4 percent to $94.83 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and the MSCI All-Country
World Index of equities advanced 8.4 percent. Treasuries 
returned 1.9 percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  World oil demand will increase by 870,000 barrels a day
this year, compared with January’s estimate of 1.08 million, and
830,000 barrels in 2013, the IEA said. It was the first time the
Paris-based group had predicted weaker growth for next year.  Monetary Fund  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its 2012 forecast for
growth in world trade to 3.8 percent from 4 percent last month,
down from 5.9 percent in 2011. The 17-nation euro area
contracted 0.2 percent in the second quarter and China has been
slowing since the beginning of last year.  Europe  accounts for 21
percent of oil consumption and  China  11 percent, according to
data from London-based BP Plc. The Asian nation is the biggest
destination for laden VLCCs.  Rates may exceed the predicted $21,250 because owners are
slowing down vessels to reduce fuel costs, their biggest
expense. That effectively reduces capacity as voyages lengthen.
The VLCC fleet sailed at an average of 9.57 knots last month,
compared with 11.55 knots three years earlier, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Fleet Expansion  Fleet growth this year may be smaller than anticipated as
owners scrap older vessels. Companies will send 3.6 million
deadweight tons of capacity for demolition this year, compared
with 3.3 million tons in 2011, Clarkson estimates. The existing
fleet is 183.2 million deadweight tons, a measure of carrying
capacity.  The pace may also slow after owners held off ordering new
vessels. Orders at ship yards reached 48 percent of existing
capacity in 2008, just after rates peaked at $229,000, and were
last at about 10 percent, according to data from IHS Inc., an
Englewood, Colorado-based research company.  The IEA’s forecast for slowing demand growth in 2013 may be
partly offset by shifting trade patterns that are lengthening
tanker journeys. About 700,000 barrels a day that used to be
delivered within the Atlantic is now going to  Asia , according to
Tufton Oceanic Ltd., a shipping hedge fund managing about $1
billion of assets. China will overtake the U.S. next year as the
largest customer for all sizes of crude tankers, estimates
Arctic Securities ASA, an Oslo-based investment bank.  Oil Consumer  VLCC rates slumped 84 percent since the beginning of April,
after jumping as much as 67 percent in three months as buyers
stockpiled crude in anticipation of an embargo on Iranian
supply. The 27-nation European Union agreed to impose sanctions
on OPEC’s third-biggest member in January, phasing in the curbs
through July 1. The U.S. and EU say  Iran’s nuclear program  is
aimed at producing atomic weapons while the government in Tehran
says it is for civilian purposes.  China, the second-largest oil consumer, stockpiled about 90
million barrels in the first five months of the year, the most
since preparing for the 2008 Olympics in Beijing, government
data show. U.S. inventories rose 9.4 percent this year and are
within 6.9 percent of the 387.3 million barrels reached June 15,
the highest level since 1990.  Investment Banking  The scale of reserves is diminishing demand for ships, with
109 Middle East cargoes scheduled to load this month, compared
with an average of 132 in the first half, according to Nordea
Markets in Oslo, the  investment-banking  unit of the world’s
fourth-largest shipping lender. Clarkson’s predicted 3.9 percent
growth in VLCC demand this year compares with a 5.3 percent
expansion in 2011.  Crude reached $110.55 a barrel in  New York  in March because
of concern that  Iran  would retaliate against EU sanctions by
blocking the  Strait of Hormuz , the transit point for about 20
percent of the world’s oil. Prices then tumbled 30 percent,
before rebounding when the full sanctions started in July.  “Some special effects with tensions around Iran made the
market look stronger than it really was,” said Marius Magelie,
an Oslo-based analyst at ABG Sundal Collier ASA, whose
recommendations on shipping companies returned 20 percent in the
past year. “Lower oil consumption means lower demand for
transportation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
