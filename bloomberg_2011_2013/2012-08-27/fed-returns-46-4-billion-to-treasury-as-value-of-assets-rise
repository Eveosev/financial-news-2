The  Federal Reserve  paid the
Treasury $46.4 billion during the first six months of 2012, a 15
percent increase from $40.5 billion in the same period last
year.  The Fed disclosed the payments to the Treasury in a new
 quarterly release  of the central bank’s financial reports
released today in Washington. The data was previously disclosed
on an annual basis when the Fed released its audited financial
statements.  The new unaudited quarterly reports are aimed at providing
“greater transparency by communicating financial information on
a more frequent basis and in greater detail,” the Fed said in a
statement.  The central bank earns income through its $2.58 trillion
portfolio of securities and other assets on a  balance sheet  that
totaled $2.83 trillion as of Aug. 22. Assets such as  Treasury
securities  and mortgage-backed securities, mostly acquired
through two rounds of large-scale asset purchases, known as QE,
pay interest to the Fed. The Fed pays its operating expenses
from these funds and remits most of what’s left over to the
Treasury.  Through June 30 of this year, the Fed has earned $42.7
billion in interest income from its portfolio of assets. The
central bank’s holdings of Treasuries increased in value by $5.5
billion. The Fed system’s operating expenses, which include Fed
funding for the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection and the
Office of Financial Research, totaled $2.79 billion, up from
$2.56 billion during the same period of time in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
