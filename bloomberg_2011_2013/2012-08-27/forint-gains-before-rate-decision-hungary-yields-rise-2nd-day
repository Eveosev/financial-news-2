The forint gained as investors
waited to see whether Hungary will cut the European Union’s
highest central bank rates. Bonds declined.  Hungary’s currency appreciated 0.1 percent to 277.95 per
euro by 4:45 p.m. in Budapest. The yield on the government’s
benchmark five-year notes rose two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 7.142 percent.  The Magyar Nemzeti Bank will probably keep its  base rate  at
7 percent tomorrow, according to 15 out of 16 analysts  polled  by
Bloomberg. One analyst expects a cut to 6.75 percent. A holiday
in the U.K. limited trading today, Peter Karsai, a Budapest-
based trader at Commerzbank AG, wrote in an e-mailed note today.  “The forint started off below 278 per euro today and the
bank holiday in  London  made any substantial moves unlikely for
the rest of the day,” Karsai wrote in the note.  To contact the reporter on this story:
