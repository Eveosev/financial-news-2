Mexican peso bond yields fell to the
lowest in two weeks as concern that global growth is slowing and
the outlook for prolonged low  interest rates  in developed
nations fueled demand for the higher-yielding assets.  Yields on peso bonds due in 2024 fell four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 5.47 percent at 9:52 a.m. in Mexico
City, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose
0.38 centavo to 140.46 centavos per peso. The yield level is the
lowest on a closing basis since Aug. 14. The peso was little
changed at 13.1731 per dollar.  German business confidence fell for a fourth straight month
in August as the sovereign debt crisis curbed growth in  Europe ’s
largest economy, data showed. Mexican bonds, known as Mbonos,
are rallying as investors seek higher-yielding assets amid
projections for weak global growth, said Vivienne Taberer, who
helps manage about $10.3 billion in emerging-market debt and
currencies at Investec Asset Management.  “That remains supportive of emerging-market bonds
generally,” Taberer said in a telephone interview from  Cape
Town . “Mbonos -- being one of the bigger, deeper, more liquid
markets -- are going to be the beneficiary of that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
