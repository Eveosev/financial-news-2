KB Financial Group Inc. (105560) , owner of
South Korea’s largest bank, led gains among financial stocks in
Seoul after Moody’s Investors Service raised the nation’s
sovereign-debt rating.  KB Financial climbed 3.7 percent, the biggest gain since
July 3, at the close of trading on the Korea Exchange.  Woori
Finance Holdings Co. (053000) , South Korea’s biggest financial group by
assets, gained 4.1 percent and Shinhan Financial Group Co. added
2.6 percent. The benchmark Kospi index dropped 0.1 percent.  South Korea’s sovereign debt rating was raised one step to
to Aa3 by Moody’s, putting it on a par with  Japan , after  Asia ’s
fourth-largest economy strengthened its resilience to shocks and
the risk of a North Korean collapse receded.  “The sovereign ratings upgrade will help lower banks’
funding costs,” Koo Kyung Hwe, a Seoul-based analyst at Hyundai
Securities Co. said by phone. “It also improves investor
sentiment for the banking sector because it reassures people of
the healthiness of South Korea’s economy.”  The nation’s strong fiscal fundamentals enable a relatively
large degree of policy space to cope with domestic risks and
external shocks, according to Moody’s statement today. The
country’s macro-prudential regulatory measures and improved risk
management also reduced banks’ external vulnerability, the
ratings company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
