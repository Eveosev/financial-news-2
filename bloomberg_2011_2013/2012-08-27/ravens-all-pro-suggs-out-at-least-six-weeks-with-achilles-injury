Baltimore Ravens All-Pro linebacker
Terrell Suggs will miss at least the first six weeks of the
season after being placed on the physically unable to perform
list with an Achilles tendon injury, the National Football
League team said.  Suggs, who was voted the NFL’s Defensive Player of the
Year last season after recording 14 sacks, was hurt while
working out in April.   Suggs, 29, has spent his entire nine-year career with
the Ravens. He had 70 tackles, seven forced fumbles and two
interceptions last season, when the Ravens went 12-4 and
had the NFL’s third-ranked defense in yards and points allowed.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
