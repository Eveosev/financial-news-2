The imposition of Additional Buyer’s
Stamp Duty in December and the slowdown in  China ’s economy in
the second quarter has led to a decrease in Chinese homebuyers
in the city-state, according to a report by HSR Global this
month.  From January to August this year, Malaysians completed 1015
transactions compared to 758 for Chinese buyers, the  report 
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
