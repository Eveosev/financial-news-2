Turkish industrial confidence this
month fell to the lowest since January, adding to evidence that
the economy is slowing.  Industrial confidence dropped to 104.5 in August from 107.3
a month earlier, according to a statement from the central bank
in Ankara today. Readings above 100 indicate an optimistic
outlook for economic activity, while readings below 100 indicate
pessimism.  Economic data show  Turkey ’s economy is cooling and the
central bank will gradually lower borrowing costs to stimulate
demand, central bank Governor Erdem Basci told reporters on Aug.
25.  Business conditions deteriorated in July, when the
purchasing manufacturers’ index declined to the lowest since
August 2011 and showed a contraction for the first time since
March, according to a report from Markit Economics and HSBC
Holdings Plc on Aug. 1.  Turkey’s economy grew an annual 8.5 percent last year, the
fastest pace among major world economies other than  China  and
 Argentina . The economy shrank 0.4 percent in the first three
months, the first contraction since March 2009, after the crisis
in the euro area intensified. In addition, the central bank
tightened monetary policy to slow consumer demand for imports
that had widened the  current account deficit  to a record $77.1
billion last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
