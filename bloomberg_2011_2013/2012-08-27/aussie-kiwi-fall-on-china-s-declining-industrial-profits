The Australian dollar touched its
lowest level in a month against its U.S. counterpart, extending
a two-week decline, after declining industrial profits in  China 
raised concern that global growth is waning.  The so-called Aussie weakened versus most of its 16 major
counterparts yesterday after a report showed profits for
industrial companies in China, Australia’s biggest trading
partner, fell 5.4 percent in July from a year earlier. New
Zealand’s dollar also fell against most major peers. China is
New Zealand’s second-largest export market.  The Aussie fell 0.3 percent to $1.0375 in  New York 
yesterday, after earlier gaining as much as 0.3 percent. The
currency declined 0.2 percent to 81.71 yen after appreciating
0.3 percent.  New Zealand’s dollar, known as the kiwi, decreased 0.3
percent to 80.86 U.S. cents after gaining as much as 0.3 percent
earlier. The kiwi fell 0.2 percent to 63.73 yen.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index of 24 raw materials
decreased 0.5 percent as commodities fell for a third day. The
 S&P 500 Index (SPX)  fell 0.1 percent.  The Aussie may extend losses to $1.017 if it declines below
so-called support at $1.0342, according to  Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken AB (SEBA) , citing trading patterns.  Australia’s currency closed last week below a previous
level of support at $1.041, before briefly rallying yesterday,
though not enough to indicate it won’t weaken further,
