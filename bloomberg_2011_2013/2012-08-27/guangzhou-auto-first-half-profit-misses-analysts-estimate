Guangzhou Automobile Group Co. (2238) ,
which makes cars with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) ,  Honda Motor Co. (7267)  and
 Fiat SpA (F) , reported first-half profit that missed analysts’
estimates amid an industry-wide slowdown in vehicle demand.  Net income fell 14 percent to 1.48 billion  yuan  ($233
million), or 0.24 yuan a share, in the six months ended June 30,
compared with 1.72 billion yuan, or 0.28 yuan, a year earlier,
Guangzhou Auto said in a statement to Hong Kong’s stock exchange
today. Sales rose 5.6 percent to 5.48 billion yuan.  Profit was 28 percent  lower  than the average net income
estimate of three analysts compiled by Bloomberg. Distributors
have stepped up discounts amid rising stockpiles, as demand
slowed with the weakest economic expansion in three years.  “In the second half of the year, the company will further
heighten its sense of crisis and urgency,” said  Guangzhou Auto 
in the statement today. China’s vehicles market “will maintain
its growth trend with the focus of development gradually
shifting to the third and fourth-tiered cities,” the company
added.  Guangzhou Auto  shares  fell 0.4 percent to HK$5.76 in Hong
Kong trading today before the announcement, widening its loss
this year to 11.1 percent. The company’s Shanghai-traded stock
fell 5.2 percent to 6.24 yuan today.  The city government of Guangzhou, where the carmaker is
based, imposed a cap on new vehicle registrations in the 12
months from July 1, or about half of last year’s total, as part
of measures to control traffic jams and reduce pollution.  Anti-Japan  Protests broke out in Guangzhou and other Chinese cities
this month as Japanese activists landed on an island in the  East
China Sea  claimed by both countries. Demonstrators called for a
boycott of Japanese goods, the state-run China Youth Daily
reported Aug. 20.  Zhongsheng Group Holdings Ltd. (881) , which distributes Toyota,
Honda and Nissan Motor Co. cars in China, said the same day that
the anti-Japan protests had limited impact on sales.  Guangzhou Auto began producing the Viaggio car with Fiat in
June. The venture plans to boost annual sales of locally built
cars to 200,000 cars in 2014, Jack Cheng, general manager of the
joint venture, GAC Fiat Automobile Co., said in an interview in
April.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
