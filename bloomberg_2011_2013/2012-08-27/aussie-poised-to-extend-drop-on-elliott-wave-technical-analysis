The Australian dollar, which fell to
a one-month today, may extend losses to $1.017 if it declines
below so-called support at $1.0342, according to Skandinaviska
Enskilda Banken AB, citing trading patterns.  Australia ’s currency closed last week below a previous
level of support at $1.041, before briefly rallying today,
though not enough to indicate it won’t weaken further,
strategists Anders Soderberg and Dag Muller in  Stockholm  wrote
in an e-mail to clients.  “Since Friday’s low point, a three wave upside correction
has been completed and the market this morning made a second
attempt to extend the break lower,” the strategists wrote in
the note, referring to Elliott Wave Theory. “Continued weakness
beyond $1.0342 will add a lot of credibility to a bearish
case,” or the argument that it will keep weakening, they wrote.  The Australian dollar depreciated 0.1 percent to $1.0392 at
11:23 a.m. in  New York , after dropping to $1.0372, the weakest
level since July 26. The currency is currently above its 50-day
moving average at $1.0342.  If the Aussie breaks below $1.0342 it is likely to weaken
toward other levels of support at $1.0281 and $1.017, Soderberg
and Muller wrote.  Elliott Wave Theory, created by American accountant and
author  Ralph Nelson Elliott  in the 1930s, seeks to predict moves
in financial markets by dividing past trends into five sections,
or waves. The theory proposes that a five-wave gain or decline
is followed by a three-wave move in the other direction.  Support refers to an area where technical analysts
anticipate buy orders to be clustered.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts of
trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
