Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  may sell
about $1.45 billion in bonds and borrow as much as $500 million
in loans to finance its $2.6 billion purchase of  Dollar Thrifty
Automotive Group Inc. (DTG) , according to a person with knowledge of
the transaction.  Hertz has obtained a $1.95 billion bridge financing
commitment from Barclays Plc, Bank of America Corp. and Deutsche
Bank AG, the company said in a regulatory  filing . The loan and
the bond sale will replace the bridge debt once the acquisition
has obtained regulatory approval, said the person, who asked not
to be identified because the terms are private  The loan may add to Park Ridge, New Jersey-based Hertz’s
$1.4 billion debt due March 2018, said the person. The piece
pays interest at 2.75 percentage points more than the London
interbank offered rate and will have 1 percent floor, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Given where we see the high yield market, the majority of
the financing we see being done in bonds,” Elyse Douglas,
executive vice president and chief financial office of Hertz
said today in a conference call with analysts.  Hertz is rated B+, the fourth level of speculative grade,
by  Standard & Poor’s . Libor is rate at which banks say they can
borrow in dollars from each other.  To contact the reporter on this story:
