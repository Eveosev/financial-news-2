Most Japanese  stocks  declined, with
the  Topix (TPX)  Index falling for a second day, after profit at
Chinese industrial companies fell, pointing to a deepening
slowdown and outweighing optimism central banks in the U.S. and
China will move to boost growth.  Komatsu Ltd. (6301) , a construction-machinery maker that gets 14
percent of its sales from China, lost 1.3 percent.  Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. (7270) , a carmaker that counts North America as its
biggest market, gained 0.5 percent after the yen weakened
against the dollar, boosting prospects for exporters.  Kansai
Electric Power Co. (9503)  sank 5.3 percent on a report the utility
won’t pay an interim dividend for the first time since 1980.
 Olympus Corp. (7733)  soared 4.4 percent after it agreed to sell the
telecommunications business of its ITX Corp. subsidiary.  The Topix fell 0.3 percent to 755.37 at the 3 p.m. close in
Tokyo, after rising as much as 0.7 percent earlier. About three
shares dropped for every two that gained. The  Nikkei 225 Stock
Average (NKY)  added 0.2 percent to 9,085.39. Volume was more than 30
percent below the 30-day average before a Fed symposium this
week at  Jackson Hole , Wyoming.  “A tug of war is being seen in the markets,” said
Seiichiro Iwamoto, who helps oversee about $34 billion at Mizuho
Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “Investors are groping for
reasons to trade shares with few catalysts available. The
economy is deteriorating globally, including in China, boosting
expectations countries will take stimulus measures to support
the markets.”  The Topix has fallen 13 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 on concern earnings will be hurt by Europe’s debt
crisis and slowing growth in China and the U.S. The decline has
cut the price of shares on the gauge to 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Industrial Slump  Exporters to China fell after the National Bureau of
Statistics said Chinese industrial companies’ profits dropped
5.4 percent last month from a year earlier to 366.8 billion  yuan 
($57.7 billion).  Komatsu slid 1.3 percent to 1,665 yen. Murata Manufacturing
Co. , an electronic-parts company that depends on China and
Taiwan for half of its sales, slumped 0.7 percent to 4,070 yen
after rising as much as 1.8 percent.  Futures on the  S&P 500  were little changed today. The
gauge rose 0.7 percent on Aug. 24 in New York after Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke , speaking in a letter dated Aug.
22 to California Republican  Darrell Issa , reiterating the
statement from the  Federal Open Market Committee ’s Aug. 1
meeting that the central bank will provide “additional
accommodation as needed.” Investors will be watching the Aug.
30 meeting at Jackson Hole closely for signs of another round of
quantitative easing.  Yen Weakens  The yen depreciated to as low as 78.84 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 78.59 at the close of  stock
trading  on Aug. 24, boosting overseas income at some Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Fuji Heavy, which makes Subaru vehicles and gets more than
45 percent of its sales in North America, gained 0.5 percent to
651 yen.  Uniden Corp. (6815) , a communications-equipment maker that
gets almost 60 percent of its revenue in North America, climbed
1.7 percent to 180 yen.  “Clearly the chances of further quantitative easing are
higher than they were six months ago,” said George Boubouras,
Melbourne-based head of investment strategy at UBS AG’s
Australian wealth management unit. The Swiss bank has about $1.5
trillion in assets under management. “The market is looking to
Bernanke’s speech at Jackson Hole for additional guidance on
policy.”  Wen Remarks  Chinese Premier  Wen Jiabao  urged additional measures to
support Chinese exports and help meet economic targets as
evidence mounts that the nation’s slowdown is deepening.  “The third quarter is a crucial period for realizing
full-year targets on export growth,” Wen said during an
inspection tour of Guangdong, the nation’s biggest exporting
province, the official Xinhua News Agency reported on Aug. 25.
“Facing the current difficulties,  China  should substantially
improve the environment for companies’ operation and improve
companies’ confidence.”  Olympus jumped 4.4 percent to 1,562 yen, the most on the
Nikkei 225, after agreeing to sell subsidiary ITX’s
telecommunications arm for 53 billion yen to boost capital as it
recovers from a 13-year accounting fraud. Olympus will book a
one-time gain in the current quarter from the sale to Japan
Industrial Partners, it said in a statement on Aug. 24.  Kansai Electric Power declined the most on the Nikkei 225,
falling 5.3 percent to 660 yen after the Nikkei reported the
utility won’t issue an interim dividend due to earnings
uncertainty, the first non-payment since the 1980 oil crisis.
Power companies led the decline among the Topix’s 33 industry
groups.  -- With assistance from Adam Haigh in Sydney. Editors: Stuart
