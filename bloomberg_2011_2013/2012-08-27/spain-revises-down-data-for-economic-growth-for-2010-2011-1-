Spain  lowered its  economic-growth 
data for 2010 and 2011, a revision that will affect estimates
for second-quarter growth due to be released tomorrow, the
National Statistics Institute said.  The euro region’s fourth-biggest economy grew 0.4 percent
last year, less than the 0.7 percent originally reported, INE
said in a  statement  posted on its website. The economy
contracted 0.3 percent in 2010, more than the 0.1 percent
initially stated, the statistics agency said in the statement.  “We have decided not to modify our estimate” of second-
quarter economic performance, said Tomas Garcia, a Madrid-based
analyst at Cortal Consors, which forecasts a 0.4 percent
contraction.  “Logically it may improve to 0.2 or 0.3 percent, but we
won’t take the improvement into account because it will be a
purely statistical effect.”  Gross domestic product figures for 2008 and 2009, which
were included in the review, were not revised, INE said. Here
are the revised numbers:  To contact the reporters on this story:
