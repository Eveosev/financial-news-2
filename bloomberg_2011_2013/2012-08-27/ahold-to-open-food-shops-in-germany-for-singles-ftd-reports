Koninklijke Ahold NV (AH)  will open its
first food shop tailored to singles in Germany in two weeks,
making it the first retailer to enter the German market since
 Wal-Mart Stores (WMT)  tried and failed, Financial Times Deutschland
reported, citing Juergen Holz, the head of Aholdâ€™s German
operations.  The first outlet will open in the city of Aachen Sept. 12,
with 11 more to follow in the state of North-Rhine Westphalia,
the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
