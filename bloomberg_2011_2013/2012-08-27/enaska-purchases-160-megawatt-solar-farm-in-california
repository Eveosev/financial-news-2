Tenaska Inc., a closely held U.S.
power generator, purchased a 160-megawatt solar project under
development in  Southern California .  Construction on the Tenaska Silverleaf Solar Energy Center
may begin by 2014, and electricity production may start the
following year, the Omaha, Nebraska-based company said in a
statement today. The photovoltaic farm will be on about 1,100
acres of agricultural land west of El Centro, California.  Terms of the purchase from San Bruno, California-based
Agile Energy Inc. werenâ€™t disclosed. The sale closed Aug. 1.  Tenaska has developed about 9 gigawatts of generating
capacity in the U.S., according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
