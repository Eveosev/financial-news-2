The New England Patriots released
wide receivers Jabar Gaffney and Donte’ Stallworth, the New York
Jets parted ways with kicker Josh Brown and the Buffalo Bills
cut quarterback  Vince Young  as National Football League teams
reduced their rosters to 75 players from 90.  Gaffney and Stallworth, both 31, had combined for 763
career NFL receptions for 10,396 yards and 58 touchdowns. The
Patriots also released 12th-year defensive lineman Gerard Warren
yesterday.  Nick Folk  won the kicking job in New York as the Jets
released Brown, a nine-year veteran.  The 27-year-old Folk, entering his third year with the Jets,
made 76 percent of his field-goal attempts and all 44 of his
extra-point tries last season. He’s been perfect this preseason,
converting field goals from 22, 30, 38 and 46 yards.  The Bills cut Young after acquiring quarterback  Tarvaris
Jackson  from the Seattle Seahawks.  Young, 29, threw two interceptions in the Bills’ 38-7 loss
to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Aug. 25.  The Washington Redskins cut kicker  Neil Rackers , opting to
give the job to Graham Gano, while the New Orleans Saints
released defensive tackle Remi Ayodele.  To contact the reporter on this story:
