The Buffalo Bills cut quarterback
 Vince Young , one day after acquiring Tarvaris Jackson from the
Seattle Seahawks, the team said in an e-mailed statement.  Young, 29, threw two interceptions in the Billsâ€™ 38-7 loss
to the Pittsburgh Steelers on Aug. 25. Today is the deadline for
National Football League teams to reduce rosters to 75 active
players.  A two-time Pro Bowl selection, Young spent his first five
NFL seasons with the Tennessee Titans after being taken with the
third pick in the 2006 draft. He was 30-17 as a starter with the
Titans, and was released in January 2011 after having a verbal
confrontation with coach  Jeff Fisher .  He played last season with the Philadelphia Eagles, going
1-2 in three starts in place of an injured  Michael Vick .  To contact the reporter on this story:
