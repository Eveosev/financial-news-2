Ukraine will sell $1 billion worth
of Eurobonds that mature in 2014 to refinance part of a $2
billion loan from Russia’s second-biggest lender VTB Group.  The bonds will have an annual coupon of 7.95 percent, the
Kiev-based Cabinet said on its  website  today.  The Eastern European nation received a $2 billion six-month
loan from VTB Group in 2010 and extended it three times. The
loan had interest rate of 6.7 percent. Another $1 billion was
repaid to VTB in June, according to the country’s  Finance
Ministry . Ukraine seeks to keep its  budget deficit  at 1.7
percent of gross domestic product this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
