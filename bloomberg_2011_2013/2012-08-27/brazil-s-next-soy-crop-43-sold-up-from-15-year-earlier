Soybean growers in  Brazil , the
largest producer of the oilseed after the U.S., had sold 43
percent of the coming 2012-2013 crop in advance as of Aug. 24,
forecaster Celeres said in an e-mailed report.  That compares with 15 percent a year earlier, Celeres said.
Growers will start planting the 2012-2013 crop next month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
