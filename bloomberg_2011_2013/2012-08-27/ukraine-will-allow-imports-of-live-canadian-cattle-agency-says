Canadian producers can ship live
cattle to Ukraine for genetics and breeding purposes, the
Canadian Agriculture Ministry said.  Access to the market in Ukraine may be valued at about C$12
million ($12.1 million) over the next three years, Agriculture
and Agri-Food  Canada  said today in an e-mailed statement. Canada
shipped cattle to Ukraine only once in the 1980’s as part of a
project for artificial insemination, according to the agency’s
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
