(Corrects price in third paragraph.)  Gasoline rose to the highest level
in almost four months in New York after a fire shut part of the
world’s second-largest refinery site, located in Venezuela.  Futures advanced today as much as 4.1 percent. Firefighters
in Venezuela are working to extinguish two  storage tanks  after a
gas explosion at the Paraguana complex killed at least 39 people
and shut the Amuay plant, which has a processing capacity of
645,000 barrels a day. Gasoline also rose as about 24 percent of
U.S. oil production from the Gulf of Mexico was shut because of
Tropical Storm Isaac, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental
Enforcement said yesterday.  Futures for September delivery gained as much as 12.7 cents
to $3.205 a gallon on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the most
since April 30. Prices are up 19 percent this year.  The Paraguana complex has a capacity of about 950,000
barrels a day, second in size to  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) ’s
Jamnagar refinery in India, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
