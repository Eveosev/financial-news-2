Perfect World  Co., a Chinese online
games developer, fell the most since Aug. 2 as investors
speculated the company may report second-quarter earnings below
analyst estimates.  Beijing-based Perfect World lost 4.8 percent to $10.48 at
2:35 p.m. New York time. Earlier it declined as much as 7.1
percent, the most on an intraday basis since May 30. The company
is scheduled to report second-quarter earnings at the close of
trading.  Investors are expecting that Perfect World’s results will
mirror rivals  Shanda Games Ltd. (GAME)  and NetEase Inc., which both
reported sales and profits that fell short of analyst
expectations, said Andy Yeung, a technology and Internet
companies analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. Shanda said on Aug. 26
that sales for the period was $178.7 million, less than the
estimate of nine analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  “The tone for the gaming sector has been weak this
quarter, and investors seem to be anticipating Perfect World
will show results similar to its competitors,” Yeung said in a
 New York  phone interview. “Growth has been moderating while
margins are compressing as expenses continue to rise because
these companies are investing more in developing games and
marketing them.”  Yeung, who has a market perform rating on Perfect World,
expects the company to report adjusted earnings of 63 cents per
American depositary receipt on sales of $106.5 million. Perfect
World is expected to report an adjusted EPS of 56 cents and
sales of $106 million, according to the estimate of eight
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
