OAO Gazprom (GAZP)  said it will halt
natural-gas shipments via the Yamal-Europe pipeline starting
tomorrow for 40 hours as part of planned maintenance.  During the repairs,  Russia â€™s gas exporter will increase
shipments of the fuel via  Nord Stream , its pipeline direct to
Germany under the  Baltic Sea , the Moscow-based company said in
an e-mailed statement today.  The repairs will be made to sections of the pipe in Russia
and Poland simultaneously and were approved by all interested
parties in late 2011, according to the statement.  The Nord Stream venture with EON AG and Wintershall AG
began fuel shipments to the European Union in November last year
and plans to double capacity after a second line is opened by
the end of this year.  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA and Nederlandse Gasunie NV are
also partners in the pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
