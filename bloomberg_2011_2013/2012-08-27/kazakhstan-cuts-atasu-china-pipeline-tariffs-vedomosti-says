Kazakhstan  is cutting pipeline
tariffs for oil shipments from Atasu to Alashankou in  China  from
September to prompt Russian  oil companies  to use the Kazakh
transit,  Vedomosti  reported.  The tariff was reduced to $11.3 to pump one metric ton of
oil per 1,000 kilometers, compared with 1,888 rubles ($59.3) per
ton per 1,000 km charged by Russian pipeline operator OAO
Transneft on the China route, the newspaper, said citing
unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
