Turkey’s antitrust regulator started
an investigation into Biletix Bilet Dagitim Basim & Ticaret AS,
Turkey’s biggest event ticketing company, on allegations that it
blocked the operations of competitors.  The investigation aims to establish whether Biletix
negotiated exclusivity accords with customers in the soccer and
concert ticket-sales market, the Ankara-based regulator said on
its  website  today. Biletix has been owned by  Beverly Hills ,
California-based Live Nation Entertainment Inc.’s unit
Ticketmaster since 2007.  To contact the reporter on this story:
