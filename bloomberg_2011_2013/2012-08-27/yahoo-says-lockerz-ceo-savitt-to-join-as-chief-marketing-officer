Yahoo! Inc. (YHOO) , owner of the largest
U.S. Web portal, named Kathy Savitt, founder of social-commerce
startup Lockerz Inc. and a former executive at  American Eagle
Outfitters Inc. (AEO) , as chief marketing officer.  Savitt will leave as chief executive officer of Lockerz to
join Yahoo next month, reporting to Chief Executive Officer
Marissa Mayer, who arrived in July from Google Inc. Savitt
previously was marketing chief at teen-apparel chain American
Eagle and worked at Amazon.com Inc., Yahoo said in a statement
yesterday.  Mayer -- Yahoo’s fifth CEO in three years -- is hiring new
people and seeking fresh ways to bolster growth as rivals
 Facebook Inc. (FB)  and Google gain ground with Internet users and
advertisers. The company has posted three straight years of
revenue declines amid turnover in the executive ranks.  “We are very excited to welcome Kathy to Yahoo,” Mayer
said in the statement. “Her extensive experience in building
and refining well-loved consumer brands like Amazon, American
Eagle Outfitters and Lockerz will be incredibly valuable as we
define Yahoo’s future.”  Yahoo, based in Sunnyvale, California, fell less than 1
percent to $14.72 at the close in New York. The shares have
declined 8.7 percent this year.  After she joins Yahoo, Savitt will become chairman of
Lockerz’s board, and Chief Operating Officer Mark Stabingas will
become CEO, the Seattle-based startup said in an e-mailed
statement. The company’s  investors  include Kleiner Perkins
Caufield & Byers and Liberty Media Corp.  To contact the reporter on this story:
