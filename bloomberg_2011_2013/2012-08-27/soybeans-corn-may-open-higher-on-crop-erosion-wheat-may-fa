What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures may open 3 cents to 5 cents a bushel higher
after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said crop  ratings  fell
for the first time in three weeks as dry weather damaged plants
in the western Midwest, Jacquie Voeks, a senior market adviser
for West Bend, Wisconsin-based Stewart Peterson Group, said in a
telephone interview.  -- Corn futures are called to open steady to 2 cents a bushel
higher as a government report showed U.S. crop conditions
worsened, Voeks said.  -- Wheat futures may open steady to 2 cents a bushel lower on
speculation that rain during the next week will improve depleted
soil moisture reserves for timely planting of winter grain in
parts of the southern U.S. Great Plains, Russia and Ukraine,
boosting yield potential, Voeks said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
