An explosion at the quarry of a
cement plant in southern  China  killed nine people and left one
person missing, the official Xinhua News Agency reported, citing
local authorities.  The blast occurred at around 2:30 p.m. when workers were
unloading explosives off three trucks in the city of Yingde in
 Guangdong province , the report said, citing a city government
statement released late today. The trucks were carrying 13
tonnes of explosives and workers had already unloaded six tonnes
when the accident happened, Xinhua said.  The quarry belongs to a subsidiary of Anhui Conch Cement
Co., the largest cement manufacturer in China, Xinhua said,
citing the government statement.  Anhui Conch Executive Director
Zhang Mingjing, reached by telephone late today, denied that the
plant was its subsidiary.  “It is not related to us,” Zhang said.  Employees of the quarry and workers who transported the
explosives from a local private explosives company were among
those killed, Xinhua said, adding that the blast shattered
windows in a nearby township across a river, injuring nine
villagers.  The city has set up an emergency response team and sent
experts to remove the unexploded explosives, while an
investigation into the cause of the blast is under way, Xinhua
said.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
