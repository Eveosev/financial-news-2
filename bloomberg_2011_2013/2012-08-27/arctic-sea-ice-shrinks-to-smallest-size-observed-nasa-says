The Arctic Ocean’s ice cover has
shrunk to the smallest size ever observed in the three decades
 NASA  has monitored it, according to the U.S. agency.  The area of ocean covered by ice shrank to 1.58 million
square miles (4.1 million square kilometers), or 27,000 square
mile less than the 2007 previous record, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration and the U.S. National Snow
and Ice  Data Center  in Boulder, Colorado, said today in a
statement.  While the sea ice melts every summer before freezing again
in September, the minimum summertime amount has declined 13
percent a decade for the past three decades, NASA said.  “The persistent loss of perennial ice cover -- ice that
survives the melt season -- led to this year’s record summertime
retreat,” Joey Comiso, senior research scientist at NASA’s
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said in the
statement.  The increasing melt may be a harbinger of greater changes
such as the release of methane compounds from frozen soils that
could exacerbate warming, and a thaw of the Greenland ice sheet,
which would contribute to rising sea levels, NASA’s top climate
scientist,  James Hansen , said in an e-mail interview earlier
this month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
