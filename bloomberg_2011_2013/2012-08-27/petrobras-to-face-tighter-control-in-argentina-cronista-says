Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4)  will face
tighter control from Argentinaâ€™s Santa Cruz province after the
Brazilian oil producer failed to invest enough to boost output,
El Cronista said, citing provincial governor Daniel Peralta.  Santa Cruz also started talks with Argentine state-run oil
producer  YPF SA (YPFD)  to extend its licenses in the province, Peralta
said, according to the Buenos Aires-based newspaper.  Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro-based Brazilian state-run
company is known, operates in the neighboring country through
its  Petrobras Argentina SA (PESA)  unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
