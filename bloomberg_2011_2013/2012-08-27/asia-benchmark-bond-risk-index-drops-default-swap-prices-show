The cost of insuring Asian corporate
and sovereign bonds from non-payment declined, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan slid one basis point to 148.5 basis
points as of 8:35 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc. prices show. The gauge has fallen from 159 basis
points at the start of the month and is headed for a third
monthly decline, according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index dropped one basis point to
198 as of 9:43 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices show. The
index has increased from 185 on July 31, according to CMA, which
is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by
dealers in the privately negotiated market.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index advanced two basis points
to 158 as of 10:19 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The benchmark is poised to close at the highest
level since Aug. 8, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
