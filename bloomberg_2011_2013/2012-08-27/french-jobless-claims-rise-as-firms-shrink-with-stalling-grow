French jobless claims rose to the
highest in 13 years in July as stalling growth prompted
companies to trim payrolls.  The number of people actively looking for work rose by
41,300, or 1.4 percent, to 2,987,100, the Labor Ministry said
today in an e-mailed statement from Paris. Thatâ€™s the highest
since August 1999. Four economists surveyed by  Bloomberg News 
expected claims of between 2.960 million and 2.975 million.  The French economy has failed to expand for three straight
quarters as a sovereign debt crisis in its third year prompts
governments to squeeze budget deficits, lowering demand for
French goods and services at home and abroad.  PSA Peugeot Citroen and  Air France-KLM Group (AF)  are among the
French companies that have announced tens of thousands of job
cuts in recent months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
