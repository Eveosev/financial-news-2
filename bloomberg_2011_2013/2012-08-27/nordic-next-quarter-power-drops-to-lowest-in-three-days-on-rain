Nordic power for the fourth quarter
dropped to the lowest in three sessions as forecasts of wet
weather boosted the likelihood of an oversupply of hydropower.  “The forecasts are much wetter, and look very reliable,
showing a low-pressure area coming in from the end of next
week,” Phong Le, senior power trader at power-trading company
Energi Danmark AS, said by phone from Arhus,  Denmark . “The
front quarter contract was slightly overbought last week, and
could drop further, tomorrow and on Wednesday.”  Precipitation equivalent to 2.9 terawatt-hours more than
the seasonal average is expected for the next 15 days, up 0.7
terawatt-hours from last week, the company said in a report on
its website. That means hydropower producers are eager to lock
in profits by producing electricity now, rather than save the
water for later and risk lower earnings, Le said. About half of
Nordic power demand is met by running water through turbines.  Nordic power for the fourth quarter dropped as much as 2.6
percent to 38.77 euros ($48.57) a megawatt-hour on Nasdaq OMX
Group Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The contract traded at
38.90 euros at 2:16 p.m. Oslo time. Month-ahead electricity lost
as much as 7.7 percent to 28.60 euros, while the contract for
2013 declined 1.4 percent to 38.95 euros.  A lower-than-expected spot price for tomorrow on the Nord
Pool Spot AS exchange in Oslo contributed to the weakening of
front-curve forward prices, Le said. Nordic power for delivery
tomorrow rose 1.6 percent to 32.74 euros, the highest level in
15 weeks. That’s still 26 cents short of market expectations of
33 euros, as reflected by the the day-ahead contract on the
Nasdaq OMX exchange.  Plant Shutdowns  EON AG (EOAN)  will run tests at its 1,400-megawatt Oskarshamn-3
reactor starting tomorrow, with production falling as low as 200
megawatts, the company said in a filing via Nord Pool Spot on
Aug. 24. A test on the turbine on Aug. 30 will cut output
completely, with full production expected the next day, EON
said. The company also plans tests on Sept. 3, Sept. 6 and Sept.
21, it said.  Vattenfall AB will cut power output at its 865-megawatt
Ringhals-1 reactor in  Sweden  to 400 megawatts from today to Aug.
30 for maintenance on a turbine, the company said on Aug. 20 in
a filing via the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
