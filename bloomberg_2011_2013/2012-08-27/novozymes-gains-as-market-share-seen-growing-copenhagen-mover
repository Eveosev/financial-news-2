Novozymes A/S (NZYMB)  advanced to the
highest price in more than four months in Copenhagen trading on
bets the world’s largest maker of enzymes is winning market
share in the detergent industry.  Novozymes  advanced  as much as 0.8 percent to 164.80 kroner,
heading for its highest closing price since April 4. The stock
rose 0.7 percent to 164.60 kroner at 9:24 a.m. in the Danish
capital compared with a 0.1 percent advance in the OMX all-share
Copenhagen index.  “Novozymes has clearly outgrown the end-market for
detergents and we believe this will continue,” Danske Markets
in Copenhagen said today in a note to clients. “Novozymes
benefits from several long-term factors increasing enzyme
content across detergent tiers and we still see room for
significant growth potential.”  Novozymes, based in Bagsvaerd,  Denmark , said on Aug. 16
that its household care unit, which makes enzymes for
detergents, made up 33 percent of group sales in the six months
through June, up two percentage points from a year earlier. The
unit is “doing quite well” and will continue to grow, Chief
Financial Officer Benny Loft said in an interview the same day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
