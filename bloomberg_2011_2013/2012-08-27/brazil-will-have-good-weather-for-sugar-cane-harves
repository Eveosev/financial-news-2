Brazil â€™s sugar-cane harvest will be
helped by dry weather this week in areas that produce the crop,
Somar Meteorologia said.  Dry weather in the past few weeks has boosted the sugar-
cane crop in Brazil, the weather consultant said in an e-mailed
report today. Heavy rain forecast for the second half of
September will hurt the harvest, Somar said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
