University of Notre Dame  running
back Cierre Wood and defensive end Justin Utupo have been
suspended for the first two games of the college football season
following a violation of team rules.  Wood, 21, and Utupo, 20, will miss the Sept. 1 game against
the U.S. Naval Academy in Dublin, Ireland, and the Sept. 8 home
opener versus  Purdue University , the athletic department said in
an e-mailed statement. The statement didn’t list what rules were
broken.  “Our players are aware of the standards I set for our
program and that failure to meet my expectations will result in
consequences,”  Notre Dame  coach  Brian Kelly  said. “Justin and
Cierre violated our team rules, so I’ve suspended them for the
first two games of the season.”  Wood rushed for a team-high 1,102 yards and nine touchdowns
last season. Utupo played in all but one game last year,
primarily on special teams.  Quarterback Tommy Rees and linebacker Carlo Calabrese were
suspended earlier for the game against Navy after being arrested
when police broke up an off-campus party. Kelly has named
sophomore quarterback Everett Golson as the starter for the game
in Dublin.  To contact the reporter on this story:
