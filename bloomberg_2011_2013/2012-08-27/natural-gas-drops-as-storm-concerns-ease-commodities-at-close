The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of
24  raw materials  fell 0.5 percent to settle at 666.96 at 4 p.m.
in  New York , led by natural gas and crude oil.  NATURAL GAS  Natural gas fell to a two-month low on speculation that
production cuts in the  Gulf of Mexico  because of Tropical Storm
Isaac will do little to ease a supply glut.  The National Hurricane Center said Isaac will become a
Category 1 hurricane before reaching  Louisiana  on Aug. 29. About
48 percent of offshore output was shut today, the government
said. The Gulf accounted 7 percent of U.S. production in 2011,
down from 17 percent in 2005.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , gas futures for
September delivery dropped 1.8 percent to $2.653 per million
British thermal units, the lowest settlement since June 22.  CRUDE OIL  Crude oil fell for the third straight session on
speculation that Isaac will have limited impact on U.S.
production.  On the Nymex, oil futures for October delivery dropped 0.7
percent to $95.47 a barrel.  Brent oil for October slid 1.2 percent to $112.26 a barrel
on the London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  GRAINS, OILSEEDS  Soybean futures fell from a record after a government
report showed a slowdown in demand for supplies from the U.S.,
the world’s largest grower and exporter last year.  On the Chicago Board of Trade, soybean futures for November
delivery slid 0.6 percent to $17.215 a bushel. Earlier, the
price reached $17.605, the highest ever for a most-active
contract.  Wheat futures for December delivery fell 0.8 percent to
$8.8125 a bushel.  Corn futures for December delivery dropped 1 percent
$8.0075 a bushel.  LIVESTOCK  Cattle declined to a one-month low on signs of increasing
U.S. beef supplies.  On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for
October delivery slid 0.8 percent to $1.23475 a pound, the
biggest decline since Aug. 16. Earlier, the price touched
$1.234, the lowest since July 27.  Feeder-cattle futures for October settlement dropped 0.3
percent to $1.43925 a pound.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 1.2 percent to
settle at 73.25 cents a pound.  BASE METALS  Copper fell for the second straight session as concern that
the  Federal Reserve  will hold off on signaling more U.S.
stimulus measures clouded the outlook for demand.  On the Comex in New York, copper futures for December
delivery slid 0.2 percent to $3.4825 a pound. The metal dropped
0.3 percent on Aug. 24.  The London Metal Exchange was closed for a public holiday.  OIL PRODUCTS  Gasoline rose to the highest in almost four months as U.S.
Gulf Coast refineries shut with the approach of Isaac, and a
fire in  Venezuela  closed the country’s largest refinery.  On the Nymex, gasoline futures for September delivery
advanced 2.5 percent to $3.1548 a gallon, the highest settlement
since April 30.  Heating-oil futures for September-delivery gained 0.17 cent
to $3.1118 a gallon.  PRECIOUS METALS  Gold rose to a 19-week high on speculation that Europe may
take steps to bolster the region’s economy.  On the Comex, gold futures for December delivery gained 0.2
percent to $1,675.60 an ounce. Earlier, the price reached
$1,679.30, the highest since April 12.  Silver futures for December delivery climbed 1.4 percent to
$31.137 an ounce.  On the New York Mercantile Exchange, platinum futures for
October delivery dropped 0.1 percent to $1,553.20 an ounce.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 0.4
percent to $656.30 an ounce.  SOFT COMMODITIES  Coffee rallied the most in five weeks on speculation that
Isaac will damage beans stored in warehouses in  New Orleans .  On ICE Futures U.S. in New York, arabica coffee for
December delivery increased 2.7 percent to $1.6735 a pound, the
biggest increase since July 19.  Cocoa futures for December delivery rose 3.2 percent to
$2,473 a metric ton, the biggest advance since July 26.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery slid 0.1 percent to
19.56 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery tumbled 3.5
percent to $1.138 a pound.  Cotton futures for December delivery rose 1.2 percent to
76.14 cents a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
