Pacific Rubiales Energy Corp. (PRE) , which
operates Colombia’s largest oil field, awarded a $100 million
contract to RWL Water Group to design and build a water-
desalination plant.  The plant will produce 500,000 water barrels a day at a
Pacific Rubiales oil field in central Colombia’s Meta
department, according to a statement today from New York-based
RWL.  The plant will treat water that’s a byproduct of petroleum
extraction and is currently disposed of by injecting it into the
ground. The purified water will be used to grow trees and will
help the Bogota-based  oil company  meet environmental discharge
requirements, according to the statement.  RWL is “providing an innovative, lower cost and
sustainable alternative to manage water production from our
Rubiales oil field, as well as establishing a new green industry
that benefits the region,” Pacific Rubiales Chief Executive
Officer Ronald Pantin said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
