Vietnam ’s one-year bonds fell for a
sixth day, pushing the yield to a one-month high, on speculation
demand for existing securities will weaken as the government
sells new debt. The dong was little changed.  The State Treasury will offer 5 trillion dong ($240
million) of notes on Aug. 29 and Bank for Social Policies will
offer 2.5 trillion dong of debt on Aug. 31, according to the
Hanoi Stock Exchange. Vietnam’s overnight  money-market  rate more
than quadrupled this month as banks hoarded cash to meet
customer withdrawals after Nguyen Duc Kien, co-founder of Asia
Commercial Bank, was arrested on Aug. 20. The rate was at 6.03
percent today, compared with 1.47 percent at the end of July.  “Supply of  government bonds  continues to be abundant,”
analysts at Bank for Investment & Development of Vietnam,
including Hanoi-based Hoang Nu Ngoc Thuy and Nguyen Thu Linh,
wrote in a research note today. “Borrowing costs, which will
probably stay high, and unstable  market sentiment ” will deter
investors, they wrote.  The yield on the one-year notes gained two basis points, or
0.02 percentage point, to 8.90 percent, the highest level since
July 27, according to a daily fixing from banks compiled by
Bloomberg.  The dong gained 0.1 percent to 20,865 per dollar as of 4:03
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
 State Bank  of Vietnam set the currency’s reference rate at
20,828, unchanged since Dec. 26, according to its website. The
dong is allowed to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of
the rate.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
