German 10-year bonds stayed higher
after a report showed business confidence fell for a fourth
consecutive month.  The yield on the 10-year bund decreased one basis point to
1.35 percent at 9.04 a.m. London time. The two-year note yield
was at minus 0.007 percent.  The Ifo institute in Munich said its business climate
index, based on a survey of 7,000 executives, dropped to 102.3
in August from 103.2 in July. Thatâ€™s the lowest reading since
March 2010. Economists predicted a decline to 102.7, according
to the median of 37 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey.  To contact the reporter on this story:
