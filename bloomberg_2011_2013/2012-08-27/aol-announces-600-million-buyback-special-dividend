AOL Inc. (AOL)  announced a $600 million
accelerated stock buyback agreement and a special cash  dividend 
of $5.15 a share, the final steps in returning about $1.1
billion to shareholders.  The  Internet company  will purchase $600 million worth of
common stock under an agreement with Barclays Plc, according to
a statement today. The one-time dividend will be payable Dec.
14, New York-based AOL said.  This month AOL, owner of the Huffington Post and TechCrunch
websites, rose to its highest value since it was spun out of
 Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009, after an increase in advertising
revenue and a one-time gain on a patent sale helped the company
return to a profit in the  second quarter .  The company also adopted a tax asset protection plan as a
deterrent to any individual or fund acquiring more than 4.9
percent of its shares outstanding without approval of the board.
AOL said it wants to protect potential benefits that might be
curbed if control of the company changed.  The  shares  rose 2.9 percent to $33.86 at the close in  New
York  time. AOL has more than doubled in value this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
