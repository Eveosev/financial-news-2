Kazakhstan, the biggest wheat
producer in Central Asia, harvested almost 40 percent of the
area planted with grains, or 6.1 million hectares (15.1 million
acres) since reaping began last month, according to the
 Agriculture Ministry .  Average yields were 740 kilograms (1,631 pounds) per
hectare, the ministry said today in a statement on its website.
The country had milled 4.5 million metric tons of grain as of
today.  Kazakhstan may gather about 13 million tons of grains this
season, Yevgeniy Aman, the Agriculture Ministryâ€™s executive
secretary, said Aug. 15. The country may lose 353,000 hectares
of planted grains, or 2 percent of the total, due to drought,
Agriculture Minister Asylzhan Mamytbekov said July 24.  Kazakhstan harvested a record 26.9 million tons of grain in
2011, according to government data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
