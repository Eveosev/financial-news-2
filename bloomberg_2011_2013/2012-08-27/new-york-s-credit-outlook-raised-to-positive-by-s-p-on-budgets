New York, where Governor  Andrew Cuomo  pushed through two consecutive on-time state budgets for
the first time since 2006, had its credit outlook raised to
positive by  Standard & Poor’s .  The rating company said in a report today that it was
revising from stable the state’s AA rating on general-obligation
debt. Cuomo also has restrained Medicaid spending growth, cut
school funding costs and instituted a pension overhaul that
boosted the  retirement age  to 63 from 62 for new workers, S&P
said in an e-mailed statement.  “We base the outlook revision on what we view as the
state’s movement toward structurally balanced budgets in the
past two years,” David Hitchcock, an S&P analyst, said in the
statement.  S&P said its rating on New York, whose 19.4 million
residents make it the third-most-populous U.S. state, could be
raised if it produces balanced budgets over the next two years.
 Josh Vlasto , a Cuomo spokesman, declined to comment immediately.  The outlook revision is the latest victory for Cuomo since
the 54-year-old Democrat took office in 2011. In addition to the
balanced budgets, he has pushed through a divided Legislature a
bill legalizing same-sex marriage and a property-tax cap.  To contact the reporters on this story:
