Passenger traffic at Athens
International Airport SA declined 12 percent in the first seven
months of the year as  Europe ’s economic crisis continued to hurt
spending on travel.  The number of people passing through the country’s biggest
airport dropped to 7.4 million in the seven months through July
31 from 8.4 million a year ago, according to a statement posted
on the  airport’s website . International passenger traffic fell
14 percent to 4.8 million and domestic travelers were down 8.4
percent to 2.6 million.  “A small improvement was observed in the course of July
compared to June, indicating that the summer traffic evolution
is still very volatile,” according to the statement.  In July, the number of people passing through the airport
fell 11.6 percent to 1.5 million, compared with a 12.3 percent
drop in June, the Athens-based company said.  Tourism,  Greece ’s biggest industry, accounted for almost 16
percent of gross domestic product and almost one in five jobs in
2011, according to the London-based  World Travel and Tourism
Council .  To contact the reporter on this story:
