China’s stocks  tumbled the most in
six weeks as weaker profit from  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) 
to Haitong Securities Co. underscored concern that the nation’s
economic slowdown is deepening.  China Petroleum, Asia’s biggest oil refiner and also known
as Sinopec, slid 1.8 percent after posting the lowest half-year
profit since 2008. Haitong plunged 5.2 percent, pacing losses by
brokerages, after saying six-month profit declined.  Xinjiang
Goldwind Science & Technology Co. (002202) , the country’s second-largest
maker of  wind turbines , dropped to its lowest level on record
after reporting first-half profit slumped 83 percent.  “Investors are becoming more worried about earnings for
this quarter after the poor performance of the first half,”
said Wu Kan, Shanghai-based  fund manager  at Dazhong Insurance
Co., which oversees $285 million. “Government tools to boost
the economy are limited: policy makers could cut  interest rates 
and bank reserve ratios but they’re worried that would spur
inflation.”  The  Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP)  sank 1.7 percent to 2,055.71
at the close, the lowest level since Feb. 2, 2009. The  CSI 300
Index (SHSZ300)  declined 2.1 percent to 2,228.20. The  Hang Seng China
Enterprises Index (HSCEI)  of Chinese companies traded in  Hong Kong 
retreated 1.5 percent. The  Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN) , the
measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, fell
0.2 percent in New York on Aug. 24.  Inspection Tour  The Shanghai Composite slumped 1.1 percent last week as a
report from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics showed
manufacturing may be contracting at a faster pace this month.
The index has fallen 6.5 percent this year, dragging down
estimated earnings to 9.3 times, compared with the average of
17.4 since Bloomberg began compiling the  data  in 2006.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  urged extra measures to support exports
and help meet economic targets as evidence mounts that the
nation’s slowdown is deepening. Industrial companies’ profits
fell in July by the most this year, a government report showed
today.  “The third quarter is a crucial period for realizing full-
year targets on export growth,” Wen said during an inspection
tour of Guangdong, the nation’s biggest exporting province, the
official Xinhua News Agency said Aug. 25. “Facing the current
difficulties, China should substantially improve the environment
for companies’ operation and improve companies’ confidence.”  Wen’s speech suggests the nation’s export performance may
have remained weak or worsened in August, Zhang Zhiwei, chief
China economist at Nomura Holdings Inc., said in a note today.  Earnings Decline  Sinopec lost 1.8 percent to 5.91  yuan . The company’s first-
half net income fell 41 percent from a year earlier to 24.5
billion yuan ($3.9 billion), the company said in a statement
yesterday.  Haitong Securities, China’s second-largest brokerage by
market value, slid 5.2 percent to 8.07 yuan after the brokerage
said first-half profit dropped 9.4 percent to 2 billion yuan
from a year earlier.  GF Securities Co. (000776) , the third biggest, tumbled by the 10
percent daily limit to 11.04 yuan. Some 905.2 million shares in
the company became tradable today, accounting for 15.29 percent
of the total stock, GF Securities said on Aug. 23.  Goldwind retreated 2.2 percent to 5.67 yuan, the lowest
since the stock listed in December 2007. Net income fell to
about 72 million yuan in the first half from 425 million yuan a
year earlier. Goldwind expects profit to decline at least 50
percent in the first nine months from a year earlier.  ‘Get Worse’  “The situation in China has gone beyond a soft landing
already, and the next stage is that things will continue to get
worse,”  Michael Shaoul , the chairman of Marketfield Asset
Management in New York, said by phone on Aug. 24. “The move in
local equity markets signals that the actual corporate earnings
are really deteriorating there.”  Chinese industrial companies’ profits fell 5.4 percent in
July from a year earlier to 366.8 billion yuan, the National
Bureau of Statistics said today, compared with a 1.7 percent
decline in June. Profits in the first seven months of the year
dropped 2.7 percent, the bureau said, after a 2.2 percent
decline in the first half.  Thirty-day  volatility  in the Shanghai Composite was at 12.1
today, compared with this year’s average of 17.2. About 6
billion shares changed hands in the gauge today, 23 percent
lower than the daily average this year.  The  iShares FTSE China 25 Index Fund , the biggest Chinese
exchange-traded fund in the U.S., dropped 1.4 percent last week
to $34.01.  --Zhang Shidong. Editor: Richard Frost  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
