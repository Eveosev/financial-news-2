(Corrects inaccurate designation for Schulz in ministry
statement in first paragraph of story that ran Aug. 27.)  Martin Schulz , president of the
European Parliament, and the finance minister of Germany’s
North-Rhine Westphalia call for an effective bilateral tax
treaty with  Switzerland  as a prerequisite for a necessary EU-
wide rule.  “A treaty on the European level is better than a treaty
between single states,” Norbert Walter-Borjans, finance
minister of North-Rhine Westphalia said in a statement issued by
his office.  “Until we reach a pan-European solution, we need
instruments that can already be used efficiently to fight  tax
evasion ,” he added. Schulz and Walter-Borjans met in Brussels
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
