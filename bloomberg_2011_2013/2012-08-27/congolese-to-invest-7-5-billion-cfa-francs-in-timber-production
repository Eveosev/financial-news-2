Three logging companies will spend
7.5 billion  CFA francs  ($14 million) developing forests in
southern and northeastern Republic of Congo, the Forestry
Ministry said.  Trabec, based in Pointe Noire, Congo, will spend 1.91
billion francs to produce 8,920 cubic meters (315,007 cubic
feet) of wood at Mouliene in Congo’s southern Bouenza region,
while Kimbakala will spend 2.34 billion francs producing 2,775
cubic meters at Loamba in Bouenza, the ministry said in a
statement today in Brazzaville, the capital.  A third company, Societe Exploitation et Transformation de
Bois de Moungouma, will invest 3.3 billion francs to produce
6,216 cubic meters of wood at Likouala in northeastern Congo,
the ministry said.  Congolese forestry laws require companies to process 85
percent of their timber, while restricting exports of logs to 15
percent of total production. Lumber is the second-biggest source
of foreign exchange, after oil. Forests cover two-thirds of the
Central African nation’s territory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
