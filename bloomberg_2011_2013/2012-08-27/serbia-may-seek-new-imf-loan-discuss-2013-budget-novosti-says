Serbia will consult the
 International Monetary Fund  when it prepares next year’s budget
and may negotiate a new arrangement with the lender, scrapping
one suspended in February,  Vecernje Novosti reported , citing a
government source it didn’t name.  Talks on the new program may begin as early as October
after a fact-finding visit by an IMF mission next month that
will focus on recent changes to the central bank law and the
macroeconomic outlook, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
