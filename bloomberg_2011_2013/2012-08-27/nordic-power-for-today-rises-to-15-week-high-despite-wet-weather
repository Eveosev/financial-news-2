Nordic power for delivery today rose
to the highest level in almost 15 weeks even as a forecast for
wet weather improved the outlook for hydroelectric power output.  Power for today advanced to 32.22 euros ($40.30) in
yesterday’s auction on the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange. That’s
the highest price since May 15.  Nordic power for the fourth quarter dropped as water
available for generating electricity is set to rise. The
contract for the three months from October dropped as much as
1.6 percent to 39.15 euros megawatt-hour on Nasdaq OMX Group
Inc.’s energy exchange in Oslo. The contract traded at 39.25
euros at 10:08 a.m. Oslo time. Month-ahead electricity lost as
much as 3.2 percent to 30 euros.  The hydrological balance, which reflects water in
reservoirs, stored in the soil and as snow in mountains, may
rise by 1.4 terawatt-hours to 9.3 terawatt-hours by the middle
of next week, Danish trading company Scanenergi AS said in a
report on its website today. Half of Nordic power use on average
is met by running water through turbines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
