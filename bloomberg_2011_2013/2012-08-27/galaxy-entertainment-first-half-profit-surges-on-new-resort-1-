Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. (27) ’s
first-half profit climbed nine fold after the Macau casino
operator drew more Chinese visitors to a gambling resort it set
up last year.  Net income  for the six months ended June rose to HK$3.45
billion ($445 million) from HK$378 million a year earlier.
Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization, or Ebitda, surged to HK$4.7 billion from HK $1.8
billion for the six months.  The company opened the Galaxy Macau resort on the city’s
Cotai strip in May last year. It plans to invest HK$16 billion
to almost double the size of that gambling center in the Chinese
city to compete with rivals including  Sands China Ltd. (1928) ,  Wynn
Macau Ltd. (1128)  and  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (6883)  First-half revenue
doubled to HK$28.3 billion.  “The profit jump was largely due to the contribution of
Galaxy Macau,” said Chief Financial Officer  Robert Drake  in a
telephone interview after the earnings announcement. “Our
resorts will continue to ramp up.”  Galaxy shares fell 3.3 percent to HK$21.75 at the 4 p.m.
close in Hong Kong. The benchmark  Hang Seng Index  dropped 0.41
percent.  Mass Market  “Galaxy will be likely to see continuous improvement in
the mass market business, benefiting from a ramp-up of its
integrated resorts,” said Grant Govertsen, a Macau-based
analyst at Union Gaming Research ahead of the earnings
announcement.  Mass market revenue growth will outpace high-stakes
gambling, or the VIP business, for the next two to three years,
according to Govertsen. The slower Chinese economy will hurt VIP
operations more than the mass market, he said.  The planned Galaxy Macau expansion will add up to 500
gaming tables, luxury stores and 1,300 rooms from the JW
Marriott and the Ritz-Carlton hotels.  Casino operators are expanding even as revenue growth slows
in the Chinese city. Macau gambling revenue rose 1.5 percent to
24.6 billion patacas in July, the smallest gain since 2009, on
easing demand and the effects of a typhoon.  China ’s gross
domestic product grew 7.6 percent in the second quarter, the
slowest since 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
