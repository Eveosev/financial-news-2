Finlandâ€™s economy will expand at a
slower rate than previously forecast, OP-Pohjola Group, a
Finnish banking and insurance co-operative, said in a report
today.  The economy will grow 0.7 percent this year and 1.4 percent
in 2013, the Helsinki-based group said. It previously forecast
the economy will grow 1 percent in 2012 and 2 percent next year.
Main reasons for the forecast cut include weaker export demand
and tax increases, which will hurt consumer spending power, OP-
Pohjola said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
