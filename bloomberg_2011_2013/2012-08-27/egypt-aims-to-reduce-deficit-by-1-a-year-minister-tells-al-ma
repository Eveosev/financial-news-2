Egypt ’s government is working on an
economic program that aims to reduce the country’s budget
deficit by one percentage point a year, Ahsraf el-Arabi, the
minister for planning and international cooperation, told the
financial daily al-Mal.  The  International Monetary Fund  has yet to impose any
conditions on Egypt as the country seeks a $4.8 billion loan,
el-Arabi told the Cairo-based newspaper. He said detailed
negotiations are slated to begin in September.  The International Monetary Fund forecasts that Egypt’s
budget deficit will widen to 10 percent of economic output this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
