High-yield bond funds in the U.S.
attracted $597 million from European investors last week, the
most since February, as the region’s leaders struggled to
resolve the sovereign debt-crisis.  Inflows from  Europe  into U.S. speculative-grade funds in
the period ended Aug. 22 doubled from $297 million in the
previous week, according to data from research firm EPFR Global
in Cambridge, Massachusetts. That’s the most since $955 million
of inflows in the week ended Feb. 8.  Investors are seeking haven in American  junk bonds  as the
European Central Bank’s plan to purchase government debt is said
to be held up by a German court’s ruling on a permanent bailout
fund. ECB President  Mario Draghi  said he’s waiting to unveil
details of his plan until a Sept. 12 decision from Germany’s
Federal Constitutional Court.  “Last week, European investors pretty aggressively went
hunting for higher yields,” said  Cameron Brandt , director of
research at EPFR.  High-yield, high-risk, or junk, bonds are rated below Baa3
by Moody’s Investors Service and lower than BBB- at Standard &
Poor’s.  To contact the reporter on this story:
