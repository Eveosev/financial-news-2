Vestas Wind Systems A/S (VWS) , the world’s
largest wind-turbine maker, said it’s in talks with  Mitsubishi
Heavy Industries Ltd. (7011)  regarding a potential “strategic
cooperation.”  “If the dialogue results in an agreement, Vestas will make
a company announcement on the issue immediately thereafter,”
the Aarhus, Denmark-based company said yesterday in a statement.  There has been speculation Vestas may be an acquisition
target, following a Sunday Times report July 1 that said the
company was considering putting itself up for sale after
starting debt restructuring talks with lenders.  China Ming Yang Wind Power Group Ltd. (MY) , China’s third-
largest wind-turbine maker, denied being in talks to buy Vestas
on July 10 following a Caixin report. Vestas said July 31 that
it reached an agreement with lenders to draw on credit lines as
 cash flow  deteriorated, easing bond yields.  Vestas rose 3.04 percent in Copenhagen trading Aug. 27 to
33.91 kroner. The company has fallen 45.3 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
