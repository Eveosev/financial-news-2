French Finance Minister  Pierre Moscovici  said France will cut its budget deficit below 3
percent of gross domestic product next year.  “We want to have a credible budget policy,” Moscovici
said today after a meeting with German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  in Berlin. “We will be under 3 percent in 2013.”  France’s revised 2012 budget law includes 7.2 billion euros
($9 billion) of tax increases to meet deficit-reduction goals.
France’s next budget will be based on a growth estimate that is
“solid, reasonable and credible,” Moscovici said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
