The outlook for cotton prices is
“bearish” in the 2012-13 season as global stockpiles rise
while demand shrinks as use of synthetic fibers increases,
Morgan Stanley said.  The global economic “slowdown could present further
downside to demand,” analysts including  Hussein Allidina  said
today in an e-mailed report. “The persistence of synthetic
blending after widespread mill reconfigurations in 2011 is
likely to keep cotton demand depressed through 2012.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
