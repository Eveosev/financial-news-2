JD Group Ltd. (JDG)  rose the most in more
than three months as the South African furniture and appliance
retailer said it plans to open at least 50 stores in rural areas
across the country in the current fiscal year.  The stock climbed 2.5 percent to 41.51 rand at the close in
Johannesburg, the biggest gain since May 16.  JD Group plans to expand as it seeks to benefit from  South
Africa ’s lowest  interest rates  in at least three decades and
above-inflation wage increases.  “We are quite optimistic about the outlook for our
customers; with interest rates having dropped and wage increases
of between seven percent and nine percent, it means more money
in customer’s pockets,” Chief Executive Officer Grattan Kirk
said in a phone interview from Johannesburg today. “Over the
last few years durable goods have underperformed other goods
such as clothing, and so now is the time people are looking to
replace couches, fridges and other appliances.”  The stores planned for the more rural areas will be as much
as 40 percent smaller than the average store in larger cities,
Kirk said.  The company will also be looking to expand its customer
loans business through its retail branches, even as it maintains
its “cautious approach” to credit by limiting unsecured loans
to a maximum of 24 months and top loan amount of 25,000 rand
($2,977), Kirk said.  Net income in the 10 months to June 30 rose 26 percent to
877 million rand, compared with the 12 months through August
2011, Johannesburg-based JD Group said in a statement today.
Debtors’ costs fell 38 percent to 417 million rand. JD Group’s
financial year-end has changed from Aug. 31 to June 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
