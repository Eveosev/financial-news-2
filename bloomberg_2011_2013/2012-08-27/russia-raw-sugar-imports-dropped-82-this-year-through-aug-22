Russia’s raw-sugar imports plunged
82 percent in the period from Jan. 1 through Aug. 22 compared
with a year earlier after output surged and it exported the
sweetener for the first time.  Imports dropped to 423,100 metric tons from 2.33 million
tons in the year-earlier period, according to data published
today on the  Agriculture Ministry ’s website.  Domestic output of refined sugar reached a record 5.1
million tons in the past season, letting the country export more
than 300,000 tons of its own sweetener for the first time.  Sugar output reached 793,500 tons in January through Aug.
8, down from 2.3 million tons a year earlier, the ministry data
showed. The volumes included 368,000 tons of the sweetener made
from domestic sugar-beets, up from 61,400 tons a year earlier.
The remaining 425,500 tons were made from imported raw-sugar,
down from 2.23 million tons a year earlier, the ministry said.  The ministry on Aug. 15 forecast total national output of
the sweetener for the one-year season that ends July 31, 2013,
at 4.7 million to 5.2 million tons, with potential exports of
350,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
