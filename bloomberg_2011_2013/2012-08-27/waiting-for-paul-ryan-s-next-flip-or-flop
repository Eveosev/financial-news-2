This week represents  Mitt Romney 's opportunity to take his party back from Rush Limbaugh, the Tea Party and those House Republicans, with their single-digit approval rating. But wait: The second person on the ticket  is  a House Republican. That's what I'll be watching this week: U.S. Representative Paul Ryan twisting more energetically than the synchronized divers at the Olympics as he tries both to distance himself from his historically unpopular colleagues and embrace his celebrated role as the House wonk. Ryan's pre-convention flip-flops on Medicare and abortion have been so complete even the Russian judge would have given him a 10. It will be interesting to see what he says on Wednesday.
