U.S. Gulf Coast oils weakened as
refinery shutdowns in advance of Tropical Storm Isaac curbed
demand for the product.  Marathon Petroleum Corp., Phillips 66 and Valero Energy
Corp. are shutting four plants in  Louisiana  that total 1.09
million barrels a day of crude-processing capacity. Isaac has
shut 24 percent of U.S. production from the Gulf, the Bureau of
Safety and Environmental Enforcement said yesterday.  The premium for Heavy Louisiana Sweet versus West Texas
Intermediate narrowed $3.25 to $16.25 a barrel at 12:09 p.m. on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the smallest gap since Aug. 9.
Light Louisiana Sweet slid $1.65 to $17 above WTI.  Crude deliveries to NuStar Energy LP’s St. James terminal
in Louisiana, which receives oil from the  Gulf of Mexico  by
pipeline, stopped at about 4 a.m. central time today, Greg
Matula, a company spokesman, said in an e-mailed response to
questions today.  NuStar’s St. James and Mobile,  Alabama , terminals are all
scheduled to shut later today, Matula said.  The  difference  between Poseidon and WTI shrank by $2.60 to
$12 a barrel and Mars Blend lost $2.50 to $11.90 over the U.S.
benchmark. Southern Green Canyon’s premium narrowed by $1 to $13
a barrel.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, slipped by $1.50 to
trade at a premium of $15.  Syncrude’s premium was unchanged at $6 above WTI. The
discount for Bakken oil from  North Dakota  was steady at a $3
while Western Canada Select’s discount was unchanged at $15.50.  West Texas Sour’s difference widened 60 cents to trade $5
below WTI.  To contact the reporter on this story:
