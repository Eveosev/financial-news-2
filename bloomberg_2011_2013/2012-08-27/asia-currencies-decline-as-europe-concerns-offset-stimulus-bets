Malaysia’s ringgit and the Indian
rupee led declines among Asian currencies as  Europe ’s lack of
progress in resolving its debt crisis made investors wary of
riskier bets, cooling demand for emerging-market assets.  German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said there can be no
more aid for Greece if reforms aren’t carried out, while
Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said sovereign bond purchases
by the European Central Bank won’t help solve the region’s
crisis. Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said in a
letter dated Aug. 22 to California Republican  Darrell Issa  that
the central bank has scope for further action to boost the
economy. Bernanke gives a speech on Aug. 31 in Jackson Hole,
Wyoming, where he may clarify the potential for stimulus.  “I think there will be no clear resolution on Greece,
which will continue to weigh on sentiment,”  Thomas Harr , head
of Asia local markets strategy at Standard Chartered Plc in
Singapore, said in emailed comments to  Bloomberg News .
“Bernanke will be dovish, but that is already in the price.”  The ringgit weakened 0.3 percent to 3.1100 per dollar in
Kuala Lumpur, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rupee
weakened 0.3 percent to 55.635 while the won fell 0.1 percent to
1,135.40, paring earlier losses as Moody’s Investors Service
raised the nation’s debt rating one step to Aa3. The Bloomberg-
JPMorgan Asia Dollar Index was headed for its lowest close in a
week.  Export Outlook  The  yuan  weakened for a third day, falling 0.04 percent to
6.3568, as the central bank lowered the currency’s fixing by the
most in three weeks and the government urged greater support for
exporters.  China needs targeted measures to promote steady exports and
there are many “negative factors that will affect stable
economic operations in the second half,” the official Xinhua
News Agency reported on Aug. 25, citing Premier  Wen Jiabao 
during an inspection tour in Guangdong. The People’s Bank of
China lowered the yuan’s reference rate by 0.14 percent, the
most since Aug. 2, to 6.3392 per dollar.  “Wen’s remarks signal the exports outlook remains weak,
which weighs on the yuan,” said Banny Lam, chief economist at
CCB International Securities in  Hong Kong . “The yuan won’t
return to an appreciation trend this year.”  Elsewhere, Indonesia’s rupiah and Taiwan’s dollar
strengthened 0.1 percent to 9,523 and NT$29.980, respectively.
Thailand’s baht and the Singapore dollar dropped 0.1 percent to
31.26 and S$1.2514, respectively. Vietnam’s dong appreciated 0.1
percent to 20,865. Financial markets in the Philippines are
closed today for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
