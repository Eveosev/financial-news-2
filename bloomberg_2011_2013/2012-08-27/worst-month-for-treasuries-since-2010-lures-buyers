Investors from London to Tokyo to
Pittsburgh are plowing money back into Treasuries after the
biggest decline in 19 months, betting that even an improving
global economy won’t ignite a  bear market  in bonds.  Hedge funds and large speculators raised bullish  positions 
in 10-year Treasury note contracts this month to the highest
since March 2008. Yields, which surged to 1.86 percent Aug. 21,
sparking the worst investor losses for a four-week period since
December 2010, will be little changed by year-end, according to
the median forecast of 81 strategists surveyed by Bloomberg.  While employment and retail sales rose last month, U.S.
economic growth the next two years will remain below the 3.2
percent annual average since 1948, according to Bloomberg
surveys. Subdued inflation, Europe’s debt turmoil, mandated U.S.
spending cuts and tax increases after the presidential election,
as well as possible Federal Reserve purchases next month are all
boosting the allure of bonds.  “We are still in a deflationary, low-growth environment,”
Fredrik Nerbrand, global head of  asset allocation  at London-
based HSBC Holdings Plc, said in a telephone interview Aug. 21.
“In that environment, Treasuries provide you with stability and
a return of capital.”  HSBC increased the allocation of Treasuries to 13 percent
of its model portfolio this month from 10 percent and are buying
debt with a five-year maturity.  Holdings Increased  Money managers overseeing about $120 billion raised their
holdings of Treasuries this month to 27.6 percent, the highest
since 2007 and up from 23.4 percent in April, a Stone & McCarthy
Research Associates survey shows. They also kept their  duration ,
a reflection of how long the debt they own will be outstanding,
at 100.3 percent of what is contained in benchmark indexes in
the week ended Aug. 21, the highest level since October 2010.  The  options  market’s expectations for the pace of swings in
yields remains close to a five-year low reached last month.
Normalized volatility on three-month options for U.S. 10-year
 interest-rate swaps , called 3m10y swaptions, was 77.715 basis
points at the end of last week, down from last year’s high of
124.5 basis points in November and back approaching the 71.8
basis points reached on July 23, which was the lowest since June
2007.  Two months after the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings
Inc. in September 2008, the measure surged to a record high of
221.8 basis points.  Yields Surge  Treasury yields rose to 1.86 percent on Aug. 21 from a
record low 1.379 percent July 25, translating into losses for
investors of 1.6 percent, the most over a four-week period since
December 2010, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show.  Yields on 10-year Treasury notes fell 12 basis points last
week to 1.69 percent. The benchmark 1.625 percent security due
August 2022 rose 1 4/32 week, or $11.25 per $1,000 face amount,
to 99 13/32. The gains trimmed this month’s losses in 10-year
notes to 1.3 percent from 2.51 percent on Aug. 17.  The yield was 1.64 percent at 2:21 p.m. in New York.  The rise in Treasury yields earlier this month “was viewed
as a buying opportunity by some survey participants,” John
Canavan, a fixed-income strategist at Princeton, New Jersey-
based Stone & McCarthy, said in an interview on Aug. 20.  Benchmark 10-year Treasuries will yield 1.60 percent by the
end of September, below June’s projection of 1.90 percent,
median estimates in Bloomberg surveys show. The year-end
forecast fell to 1.65 percent from 2.1 percent.  Stimulus Chance  Last week’s slide in yields followed the release of minutes
from the July 31-Aug. 1 meeting of the  Federal Open Market
Committee , which signaled policy makers are ready to add to
record stimulus unless they are convinced the recovery is
accelerating.  The Fed will be “aggressive” and there’s a 50 percent
chance it will act next month, Rick Rieder, chief investment
officer of fundamental fixed-income at BlackRock Inc., said Aug.
23 on Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” with  Deirdre
Bolton . BlackRock, based in New York, oversees $3.56 trillion,
making it the world’s largest money manager.  That means the Fed may add a third round of bond purchases,
or quantitative easing, to the $2.3 trillion its bought since
2008. In a letter dated Aug. 22 to California Republican  Darrell
Issa , the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform
Committee, Bernanke repeated the statement from the FOMC meeting
that the Fed will provide “additional accommodation as
needed.”  ‘False Dawn’  He has an opportunity to expand on his views in an Aug. 31
speech at the Kansas City Fed’s annual economic symposium in
Jackson Hole, Wyoming.  “It’s fairly clear that their finger is really on the
trigger of doing QE3,” Franco Castagliuolo, co-manager of the
$5.5 billion Fidelity Government Income Fund, said in a Aug. 22
interview. “Whenever the economic data has surprised on the up-
side it has turned out to be a false dawn.” Boston-based
Fidelity Investments manages $1.5 trillion.  The  U.S. economy  will probably tip into recession next year
if lawmakers and President Barack Obama can’t break an impasse
over the federal budget, and if the George W. Bush-era tax cuts
expire, according to a report by the nonpartisan  Congressional
Budget Office  published on Aug. 22.  The  budget deficit  will reach $1.1 trillion this year,
according to the CBO. That would be down from last year’s $1.3
trillion, in part because  tax revenue  has risen by almost 6
percent and spending is down by about 1 percent this year.  Fiscal Cliff  This so-called fiscal cliff would cause economic output to
shrink next year by 0.5 percent and joblessness would climb to
about 9 percent from 8.3 percent if mandated spending cuts of
$1.2 trillion over a decade start Jan. 1, the CBO said.  “I don’t expect yields to go higher,” Hajime Nagata, a
bond investor in Tokyo at Diam Co., said in an Aug. 21
interview. Economic gains will “be temporary because of the
fiscal cliff,” said Nagata, who added to his Treasury holdings
this month. Diam, a unit of Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co., Japan’s
second-biggest life insurer, manages about $130 billion.  Fed stimulus will trigger faster inflation and threaten
returns for fixed investments, said  Tim Price , a money manager
who helps oversee more than $1.5 billion at PFP Group LLP, an
asset-management firm based in London.  Treasury 10-year yields of even 2 percent don’t compensate
for that risk, he said in a telephone interview on Aug. 21.  “The inevitable outcome has to be an inflationary one,
maybe not today or tomorrow,” said Price, who is avoiding
Treasuries, gilts and bunds, favoring debt of nations such as
Qatar and Singapore.  Inflation Goal  Inflation has held about the central bank’s goal of 2
percent in the two years since Bernanke first suggested he would
use asset purchases to boost growth.  Consumer prices in the U.S. were unchanged in July for a
second month, with the gain in the index of 1.4 percent over the
past 12 months marking the smallest year-to-year increase since
November 2010, the Labor Department reported on Aug. 15 in
Washington. The core measure, which excludes volatile food and
fuel costs, rose 2.1 percent in the 12 months through July.  Gross domestic product is forecast to expand 2.15 percent
this year, according to the median estimate of economists
surveyed by  Bloomberg News . While that’s up from 1.8 percent in
2011, it’s below the average of 3.1 percent in 2004 through
2006, before the start of the worst financial crisis since the
Great Depression.  No Pressure  “The U.S. will have continued slow growth in the
neighborhood of about 2 percent,”  James Kochan , chief fixed-
income strategist in Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin, at Wells Fargo
Funds Management LLC, which manages $202 billion, said in an
Aug. 22 telephone interview. “You are not going to see
significant pressure on interest rates anytime soon.”  The Fed has kept its benchmark  interest rate  for overnight
loans between banks in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since
December of 2008 and says it expects to keep them low until at
least late 2014.  That’s because even as some data has improved, including an
addition of 163,000 new workers to the  labor force  in July, the
 unemployment rate  at  8.3 percent  has held above 8 percent since
February 2009. Initial  jobless claims  rose by 4,000 for a second
week to reach a one-month high of 372,000 in the period ended
Aug. 18, the Labor Department reported Aug. 22.  Hedge funds  and other large speculators placed 97,540 more
contracts betting 10-year Treasury note prices will rise than
that they will fall in the week ending Aug. 21, according to
U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data.  Net Longs  Net-long positions rose by 65,204 contracts, or 202
percent, from a week earlier, the Washington-based commission
said in its Commitments of Traders report Aug. 24.  “You should not be selling Treasuries and looking for
yields to climb significantly higher,” said Mark Dowding, a
fixed-income portfolio manager at BlueBay Asset Management in
London, which oversees $41 billion in assets, during an
interview on Aug. 21.  Political risks remain in the U.S. and Europe.  Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said last
week that he wouldn’t appoint Bernanke to a third term, while
his running mate, House Budget Committee Chairman  Paul Ryan  of
Wisconsin, said on Aug. 23 that he doesn’t want the Fed to
provide additional stimulus.  The Republican convention, which was set to begin in Tampa,
Florida, today, has been delayed by a day beause of Tropical
Storm Isaac. Democrats will re-nominate Obama and Vice President
Joseph Biden next week in Charlotte,  North Carolina .  ‘Trouble Ahead’  “There is some trouble ahead,” said  Joseph Balestrino , a
money manager who helps oversee $49 billion of bonds at the
Pittsburgh-based mutual-fund company Federated Investors Inc. in
a Bloomberg TV interview last week.  “The economy has underwhelmed, domestically and
internationally,” Balestrino, the firm’s chief fixed-income
market strategist, said in an interview with Alix Steel on
Bloomberg Television’s “In the Loop” on Aug. 21. “You take
cover for a while. I don’t mind buying Treasuries at 1.8 percent
on the 10-year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
