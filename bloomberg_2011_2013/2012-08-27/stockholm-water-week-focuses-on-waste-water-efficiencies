World Water Week  opened today in
Stockholm with industry executives and scientists from at least
100 nations discussing how to reduce  food waste  and use water
more efficiently in agriculture and at home.  The Stockholm Industry Water Award will be given tomorrow
to  PepsiCo Inc. (PEP) , the world’s largest snack-food maker, for
reducing water consumption in production and increasing water
efficiency, saving almost 16 billion liters of water last year
from a 2006 baseline.  “The numbers show that agriculture is a thirsty
activity,” said Jose Graziano da Silva, director-general of the
 United Nations ’  Food and Agriculture Organization , or FAO. “But
that also means that agriculture holds the key to sustainable
water use.”  King Carl XVI Gustav of Sweden will award the Stockholm
Water Prize to the International Water Management Institute for
its agricultural water management work, said the event’s
organizer, Stockholm International Water Institute.  The annual SIWI event started in 1991. The conference
earlier discussed how to improve access to water in water-scarce
areas and boost supplies in an urbanizing world. This year’s
agenda addresses how to curb so much of the world’s water being
used to grow food that’s thrown away.  “Reducing the waste of food is the smartest and most
direct route to relieve pressure on water and land resources,”
said Torgny Holmgren, SIWI’s executive director. “It’s an
opportunity we cannot afford to overlook.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
