HTC Corp. (2498) , the world’s second-
largest maker of smartphones using  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android system,
fell in Taipei trading after  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  won a patent
infringement case against Samsung Electronics Co.  HTC dropped as much as 3.2 percent, the most in a week, to
NT$254.00 before trading at NT$255.50 as of 10:06 a.m. local
time. The benchmark  Taiex (TWSE)  index fell 0.2 percent.  A U.S. jury found that Samsung, the world’s largest maker
of Android-based phones, breached six of seven patents Apple
held for technology used in mobile devices and ordered the South
Korean company to pay more than $1 billion. Apple has also
accused HTC of infringing its patents, with suits pending in
U.S. courts and an International Trade Commission case scheduled
to release findings Nov. 7.  “The Samsung/Apple case also suggests that HTC’s upcoming
(initial) ruling on Nov. 7 could be a tough battle for HTC,”
Jeff Pu, an analyst at Fubon Financial Holding Co. in Taipei,
 wrote  today. He rates HTC reduce.  Samsung, which said it will file post-verdict motions to
overturn the decision, dropped as much as 7.7 percent in Seoul
trading today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
