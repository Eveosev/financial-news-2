The trade deficit in  Kenya , one of
the world’s largest growers of black tea, widened in June as
exports fell, the country’s statistics agency said.  The gap increased to 70.8 billion shillings ($842 million)
from 60.5 billion shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based
Kenya National Bureau of Statistics said today in a  statement  on
its website. Imports climbed 7 percent to 112.1 billion
shillings, while exports declined 6 percent to 41.3 billion
shillings, the agency said.  Shipments of tea fell 17 percent to 29,148 metric tons, and
earnings from those sales dropped 13 percent to 7.8 billion
shillings, the agency said. Tea output climbed 14 percent to
37,383 tons in May, with figures for June not provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
