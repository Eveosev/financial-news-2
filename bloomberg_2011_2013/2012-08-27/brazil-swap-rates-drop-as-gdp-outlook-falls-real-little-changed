Brazil ’s swap rates fell the most in
two weeks after economists lowered their forecast for this
year’s growth, spurring speculation policy makers will sustain
the pace of cuts in borrowing costs.  Swap rates on contracts due in January 2014 dropped seven
basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 7.89 percent, the
most since Aug. 13 on a closing basis.  “The central bank will have to do its part to revive the
economy,”  Andre Perfeito , the chief economist at Gradual
Investimentos, said in a phone interview from  Sao Paulo .  The  real  slid 0.3 percent to 2.0336 per dollar after
posting on Aug. 24 its first five-day decline in three weeks.
The central bank auctioned reverse currency swaps on Aug. 21 for
the first time since March as the real strengthened toward 2 per
dollar.  Economists covering Brazil lowered their 2012 growth
forecast for a fourth straight week as the largest emerging

survey of about 100 economists published today, compared with a
projection in the previous week of 1.75 percent growth. The
economists held their 2013 expansion forecast at 4 percent.  Policy makers have cut the target lending rate by 4.5
percentage points since August 2011 to a record low 8 percent.
The government has pressured commercial banks to increase
lending and cut taxes to revive growth.  Central Bank Meeting  Traders are betting on an additional reduction of a half-
percentage point in the Selic at this week’s policy meeting,
swap rates indicate.  Brazil’s economy grew at an annualized 0.8 percent pace in
the first quarter, less than half the rate of the U.S. Results

Brasil Economico reported, citing unidentified officials from
the  Finance Ministry . An official at the ministry declined a
request for comment from  Bloomberg News .  The economy will grow at a 4 percent annual rate by year-
