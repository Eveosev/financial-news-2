Former Florida Governor  Charlie Crist , who was elected as a Republican before dropping his party
affiliation in 2010, will have a speaking role at the Democratic
National Convention, a party official said.  Crist, a St. Petersburg lawyer who lost his independent bid
for the Senate two years ago to Republican Marco Rubio, endorsed
President  Barack Obama  in a newspaper column yesterday. Crist’s
speaking time at the Democratic gathering, which starts next
week in Charlotte, North Carolina, wasn’t set yet, said the
Democratic official, who didn’t have authority to speak on the
record.  The speaking role upset some Florida Democrats, including
state Senator Nan Rich, a candidate for governor in 2014, who
said in an interview that she had appealed to former President
 Bill Clinton . Crist didn’t return a phone call for comment today.  Crist is seen as a potential Democratic candidate for
Florida governor in two years to run against Republican Governor
 Rick Scott . Scott’s 41 percent approval rating in an Aug. 23
Quinnipiac University poll was the highest he’d received in a
survey from the Hamden, Connecticut-based institution since
taking office last year.  In a June 8 poll by Public Policy Polling, 14 percent of
Florida voters said they’d heard of Rich. Still, she led Scott
by 12 points in a hypothetical matchup.  To contact the reporter on this story:
