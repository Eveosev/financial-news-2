(Corrects spelling of company name in headline.)  Advanced Info Service Pcl (ADVANC) ,
Thailand’s biggest mobile-phone company, fell the most in nine
months in Bangkok trading after a technical signal indicated the
stock was poised to decline.  Advanced Info  dropped  4 percent to 218 baht as of 3:42
p.m., headed for the biggest decline since Nov. 25. The stock
was the worst performer in the  SET50 Index (SET50) , which gained 0.2
percent. The shares advanced 10 percent in the three trading
days through Aug. 24, when they closed at a record 227 baht.  “The shares have risen very fast and have almost reached
our price estimate,” Athaporn Arayasantiparb, head of research
at UOB-Kay Hian Securities (Thailand) Pcl in Bangkok, said by
telephone today. “Some investors may view it’s time to take
profit as the stock has limited room for upside gains.”  The brokerage has a buy rating on Advanced Info and a 12-
month price estimate of 224 baht.  The Bangkok-based company’s 14-day  relative strength index ,
a gauge of how rapidly share prices advance or decline, closed
at 72.9 on Aug. 24, the highest level since July 11, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. A reading above 70 suggests a
security is overvalued and is seen by some investors as a signal
to sell.  The shares have rallied 56 percent this year, compared with
a 21 percent gain in  Thailand ’s benchmark SET Index.  -- Editors: Lena Lee, Subramaniam Sharma  To contact the reporter on this story:
