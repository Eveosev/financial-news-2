Swiss Re Ltd. (SREN) , the world’s second-
biggest reinsurer, said the role of the  insurance industry  in
Italy will grow as the government cuts spending on social
benefits.  Swiss Re expects growth opportunities for insurers
particularly in the “underdeveloped” non-motor lines of
business because of the adverse macroeconomic environment, the
Zurich-based reinsurer said in an e-mailed  release  today.  Italy, the world’s eighth-largest economy, must remain
focused on budget discipline as it sets out a plan for policies
to stimulate economic growth, Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti 
said last week. Monti, who imposed austerity in the first half
of his 18-month term, is calling on ministers to formulate
policies to pull Italy out of its fourth recession since 2001.  “The financial crisis has resulted in fiscal tightening
and spending cuts which are accelerating the reduction and
rebalancing of the welfare system in Italy, leaving a
significant protection gap not only in health care and old-age
provision, but also in natural catastrophe coverage,” said  Kurt Karl , Swiss Re’s chief economist. “The insurance industry must
prepare itself to take charge of its new, expanded role in Italy
to support the state, private entities, and individuals in
addressing some of their greatest economic challenges ever.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
