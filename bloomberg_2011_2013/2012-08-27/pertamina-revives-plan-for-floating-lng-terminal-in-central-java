PT Pertamina, Indonesia’s state-
owned  oil company , said it will proceed with a plan to build a
floating liquefied natural gas-receiving terminal in Central
Java, almost four months after putting the project on hold.  The government asked Pertamina to continue construction of
the terminal, which will have a capacity of 3 million metric
tons of LNG a year, Hari Karyuliarto, the company’s gas
director, told reporters in Jakarta today. Pertamina had
initially decided to delay the project, Karyuliarto said May 3.  “We will try to meet the government’s order of getting the
Central Java floating terminal to go on stream by 2014,”
Karyuliarto said. Pertamina is seeking 1.5 million tons of LNG
from domestic suppliers for the facility, he said.  Indonesia  is increasing natural gas consumption for
electricity generation and transportation to reduce petroleum
use and cut fuel subsidies. The terminal will convert LNG into
gas, which will be supplied to power plants run by state utility
PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara and other industrial consumers,
Karyuliarto said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
