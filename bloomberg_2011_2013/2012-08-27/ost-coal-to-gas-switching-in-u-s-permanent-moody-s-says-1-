Coal won’t win back much of the
share of electricity generation that it has lost to natural gas
in the U.S., Moody’s Investors Service said.  “Coal will regain a bit of market share as natural gas
prices recover somewhat, but most coal-to-gas substitution to
date will be permanent,” Anna Zubets-Anderson, a Moody’s vice
president and senior analyst, wrote in the report. Production
from shale has boosted gas inventories and coal has faced more
scrutiny from environmental regulators.  The Energy Department  forecast  in its Short-Term Energy
Outlook Aug. 10 that coal’s contribution to electricity
generation will drop to 37 percent this year, down from 42
percent in 2011 and 49 percent in 2007. Gas’s share will climb
to 31 percent from 25 percent in 2011.  Natural gas fell to a 10-year low this year as inventories
rose to 60 percent above the five-year seasonal average. Today
the price fell 1.5 percent to $2.661 per million British thermal
units, up 40 percent from the low of $1.902 reached in April.  Environmental Protection Agency rules such as the Mercury
and Air Toxics Standard and the Carbon Pollution Standard for
New Plants also dissuade coal use and investment in plants that
would burn the fuel, Zubets-Anderson said.  U.S. producers are also navigating lower prices for
metallurgical coal, needed by  steelmakers , because of tepid
global demand for steel, Moody’s said.  “We see limited medium-term upside for met coal prices,”
Zubets-Anderson said. “The prospects for the worldwide  steel
industry  are not encouraging. The U.S. steel industry continues
to cope with persistent capacity utilization rates below 80
percent, a level that would indicate healthy industry
conditions.”  Coal on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange fell 70 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $56.68 a ton on Aug. 24, the lowest price since
July 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
