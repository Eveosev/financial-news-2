A Ukrainian court said it will
announce its verdict in the case of jailed opposition leader
 Yulia Tymoshenko  on Aug. 29.  The High Specialized Court for Civil and Criminal Cases in
the capital, Kiev, completed an appeal hearing into her
conviction for abuse of office on Aug. 21 without issuing a
verdict or indicating a date for the decision.  Tymoshenko asked the court to overturn her seven-year jail
term. In October, she was convicted of abuse of office as a
prime minister when signing a 10-year supply and transit accord
with the Russian government on natural gas. The appeal needed to
be heard before Tymoshenko could send her case to the European
Court of  Human Rights .  To contact the reporters on this story:
