U.S. banks with more than $10
billion in assets may get more time to institute internal stress
testing required by the Dodd-Frank Act, U.S. banking regulators
said today.  The regulators proposed rules in December and January to
require the big banks -- holding companies under the  Federal
Reserve  and national banks under the Office of the Comptroller
of the Currency -- to start self-testing their portfolios
against adverse scenarios annually. The proposals, which
initially called for banks to conduct tests this year, may be
revised with a September 2013 deadline, the regulators said in
coordinated statements.  The extension would apply to banks between $10 billion and
$50 billion in assets, according to the Fed, OCC and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. The OCC said in its  statement  today that
banks with more than $50 billion may still have to run tests
this year, with the agency reserving the right to let them
“delay implementation on a case-by-case basis where
warranted.”  Dodd-Frank, the 2010 regulatory overhaul, instituted the
tests after the 2008 credit crisis in order to ensure banks were
stable enough to withstand a future calamity. The final timeline
for implementing the stress tests will be included in the rules
eventually adopted by each agency.  In a separate stress-test requirement from Dodd-Frank, the
Fed has conducted its own annual tests, reporting the first
results in March. The Fed found 15 of the 19 largest U.S. banks,
including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and
 Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) , could maintain adequate capital levels in a
recession scenario in which they kept paying dividends and
buying back stock.  To contact the reporter on this story:
