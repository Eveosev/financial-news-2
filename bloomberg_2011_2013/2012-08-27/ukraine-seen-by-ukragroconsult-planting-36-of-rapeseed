Ukrainian farmers planted 36 percent
of intended winter rapeseed by Aug. 22 after rainfall helped
improve soil moisture, according to agriculture researcher
UkrAgroConsult.  That accounts for 340,400 hectares (840,788 acres),
UkrAgroConsult, which is based in the capital, Kiev, said today
in an e-mailed report. No comparison with a year earlier was
provided.  To contact the reporter on this story:
