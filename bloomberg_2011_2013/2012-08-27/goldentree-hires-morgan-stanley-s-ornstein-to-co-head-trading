GoldenTree Asset Management LP, a
 money manager  overseeing $15.9 billion in assets, hired Daniel Ornstein from  Morgan Stanley (MS)  to co-head its trading business.  Ornstein is a partner reporting to Steve Tananbaum,
managing partner and chief investment officer at GoldenTree,
according to Scott Sunshine, a spokesman for the firm. Ornstein
led the North American distressed trading group at Morgan
Stanley.  He will work with Corey Geis, co-head of trading, Sunshine
said. GoldenTree, a New York-based firm founded in 2000, invests
mostly in leveraged loans and high-yield bonds via  hedge funds 
and collateralized loan obligations.  Lauren Onis, a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  GoldenTree raised a CLO of about $590 million with Bank of
America Corp. last week that replaces a financing for a credit
opportunity fund it oversees. The deal allows for as much as a
40 percent investment in second-lien loans and high-yield bonds.
The firm also raised a $526.8 million fund with the bank earlier
this year.  CLOs are a type of collateralized debt obligation that pool
high-yield, high-risk loans and slice them into securities of
varying risk and return.  Trading in leveraged loans dropped to $98 billion during
last quarter, a decline of nine percent from the first three
months of the year, according to the Loan Syndications and
Trading Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
