Novel Commodities SA, a company
trading agricultural products, will shift its cocoa and coffee
desks to producing countries in  Africa  at the end of the month,
according to Florian Cergneux, chief financial officer.  Novel, based in Geneva, will close its cocoa and coffee
trading in the city and sales to customers will be made via the
company’s subsidiaries in  Ivory Coast  and Cameroon, Cergneux
said by phone today. Five traders were employed on the Geneva
cocoa and coffee desks and the two remaining will leave at the
end of the month, he said.  “Previously, our local subsidiaries sold to Novel
Geneva,” he said. “This change will lighten costs for the
company, but we will continue to trade cocoa and coffee through
our subsidiaries, which are also involved in the development of
projects for local production in Africa.”  Novel, founded in 1999, began trading robusta coffee and
cocoa in 2007, according to the company’s website. It also
trades sugar and rice.  To contact the reporter on this story:
