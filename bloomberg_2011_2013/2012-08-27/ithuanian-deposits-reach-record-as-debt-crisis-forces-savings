Lithuanian  bank deposits  surged to
the highest level on record in July as businesses and households
responded to  Europe ’s debt crisis by increasing savings.  Deposits rose by 668.3 million litai ($362.9 million) from
June to 44.3 billion litai, the Lithuanian Banking Association
said in an e-mailed statement today. Loan portfolios shrank by
166.2 million litai from June to 53.9 billion litai, it said.  Lithuanians are holding on their money and businesses are
postponing investment plans as the debt crisis clouds the
economic outlook. Bank profitability is being eroded by low
demand for credit, Stasys Kropas, head of the banking
association, said in the e-mail.  “Banks are undergoing a process that can be defined as a
crisis of deposits, and July was a perfect illustration of
this,” Kropas said. “The crisis in this case is not typical,
there’s no lack of deposits. On the contrary, deposits at banks
are too high.”  Economic growth  slowed to a preliminary 2.1 percent in the
second quarter from 3.9 percent in the previous three months.  “That’s an alarming signal -- bank liabilities are
growing, while opportunities to employ the money aren’t
improving,” Kropas said. “Banks hold piles of short money that
are expensive to keep when there’s no demand for short money on
the market.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
