The ruble erased gains against the
dollar after crude oil fell on speculation a storm in the  Gulf
of Mexico  will have limited impact on oil production.  The ruble strengthened less than 1 percent to 31.8500 per
dollar by the close in Moscow. The currency was little changed
against the euro at 39.8750 and against the central bank’s
currency basket, which is 55 percent dollars and 45 percent the
common currency.  Crude gave up its earlier advance, retreating 1.3 percent
to $94.86 a barrel in  New York , as Tropical Storm Isaac was
forecast as a Category 1 storm, the weakest on the five-step
Saffir-Simpson scale.  Brent crude , a benchmark for Russia’s
Urals blend, slid 1.2 percent to $112.27 a barrel.  Investors pared bets the ruble will weaken against the
dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
32.3316 in three months versus 32.3655 on Aug. 24.  The extra yield investors demand to own  Russia ’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries rose two basis points to 225,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 were steady at 7.86
percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
