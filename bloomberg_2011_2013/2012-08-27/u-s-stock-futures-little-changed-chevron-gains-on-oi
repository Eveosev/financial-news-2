U.S. stocks fell, following the
first weekly decline in about two months for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, as investors awaited indications on whether
the Federal Reserve will provide further stimulus measures.  Hewlett-Packard Co., Alcoa Inc. and Bank of America Corp.
dropped at least 1.1 percent to pace losses in the biggest
companies.  Apple Inc., (AAPL)  the most valuable company, climbed 1.9
percent after a jury found Samsung Electronics Co. infringed six
of seven patents for its mobile devices.  Google Inc. (GOOG) , which
offers the Android mobile software, declined 1.4 percent.  The  S&P 500  slid 0.1 percent to 1,410.44 at 4 p.m.  New York 
time. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 33.30 points, or 0.3
percent, to 13,124.67. The Nasdaq-100 Index gained 0.2 percent
to 2,782.55, after rising to the highest since 2000 during the
day. Volume for exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 4.5
billion shares, the lowest level since at least 2008 excluding
days surrounding holidays, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “There’s no great conviction in either direction,” said
 Richard Sichel , who oversees $1.6 billion as chief investment
officer at Philadelphia Trust Co. He spoke in a phone interview.
“There are a couple of bright spots, such as Apple. People are
looking ahead for Fed signals. I believe Bernanke’s speech will
probably be more of the same. It’s more likely that it will be a
continuation of what we’ve been hearing and less of an event.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  probably won’t use his Aug. 31
speech at the Fed’s annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming,
to suggest a third round of bond buying is at hand, according to
economists such as  Michael Feroli  at JPMorgan Chase & Co. and
 James O’Sullivan  at High Frequency Economics.  Monthly Gain  The S&P 500, which last week failed to stay above a four-
year high, is still on pace for its third straight  monthly  gain
amid bets central banks will provide further economic stimulus.
The index has risen 2.3 percent so far in August.  Commodity, phone and industrial shares had the biggest
losses in the S&P 500 among 10 groups. HP dropped 2.1 percent to
$17.21, the lowest since 2004. Alcoa slid 1.7 percent to $8.48.
Bank of America retreated 1.1 percent to $8.07. Technology
shares in the S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent as a group.  Apple gained 1.9 percent to a record $675.68. Victories in
patent disputes over phones using Google’s Android may extend,
rather than end, the litigation that’s lasted more than two
years and spanned four continents. The jury verdict won Aug. 24
against Samsung came shortly after a trade agency in Washington
cleared Apple of some claims by Google’s Motorola Mobility unit
that could have led to a U.S. ban on the iPhone and iPad.  Steve Jobs  Together, the decisions embolden Apple to continue the
campaign envisioned by its late co-founder,  Steve Jobs , to prove
phones running on Android copied the iPhone’s features and
designs. Apple won’t stop unless there’s a decisive blow against
it, and Samsung, with its reputation at stake, also has little
incentive to settle, said Tom Scott, a patent lawyer at Goodwin
Procter LLP.  “Most commercial disputes are on the merits of the case,”
said Scott, chairman of the firm’s intellectual property group
in Washington. “This is different. It’s a war. It’s an economic
war.”  Google dropped 1.4 percent to $669.22.  Best Buy Co. added 3.2 percent to $17.87. The world’s
largest electronics retailer and founder Richard Schulze reached
an agreement allowing him to conduct due diligence in his effort
to acquire the company a week after earlier talks failed.  Dollar Thrifty Automotive Group Inc. (DTG)  rallied 7.5 percent to
$87.08.  Hertz Global Holdings Inc. (HTZ)  struck a deal to buy the
company for about $2.6 billion in cash and secure its place as
the No. 2 player in the U.S. market. Hertz jumped 8.1 percent to
$14.21.  Hudson City  Hudson City Bancorp soared a record 16 percent to $7.45.
 M&T Bank Corp. (MTB) , which counts  Warren Buffett ’s Berkshire Hathaway
Inc. among its largest investors, agreed to buy the bank to
expand in New Jersey in a deal valued at about $3.7 billion.
Under terms of the agreement, each Hudson City shareholder will
receive 0.08403 of an M&T share in the form of either M&T stock
or cash. M&T climbed 4.6 percent to $89.82.  Kenexa Inc. jumped 41 percent to $45.79.  International
Business Machines Corp. (IBM)  will spend about $1.3 billion for the
maker of Web-based human-resources and recruiting services, part
of its effort to reach $16 billion in annual analytics revenue.
IBM slipped 1.1 percent to $195.69.  Tiffany & Co. (TIF)  climbed 7.2 percent to $62.71. The world’s
second-largest luxury jewelry retailer reported a drop in
worldwide comparable-store sales that was smaller than some
analysts projected.  Buyback, Dividend  AOL Inc. (AOL)  gained 2.9 percent to $33.86 after announcing a
$600 million accelerated stock buyback agreement and a special
cash dividend of $5.15 a share, the final steps in returning
about $1.1 billion to shareholders.  ImmunoGen Inc. (IMGN)  rose 5.6 percent to $14.62. Partner Roche
Holding AG said its experimental breast cancer drug
significantly extended the lives of patients when compared with
standard therapy.  American stocks  are dominating global equities by the most
in a decade, taking a majority of the spots in a ranking of the
20 biggest companies, after earnings rose faster than the rest
of the world as the global economy rebounded. Apple,
International Business Machines Corp., Wells Fargo & Co. and
four more U.S. companies joined the top 20 since  stocks peaked 
in 2007, bringing the total to 14.  They replaced Moscow-based Gazprom OAO, China Petroleum &
Chemical Corp. in Beijing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA of Rio de
Janeiro and six others from Europe and Asia. Of the nine added,
only BHP Billiton Ltd. and  Nestle SA (NESN)  are based outside the U.S.  10 Quarters  More U.S. corporations are represented than any time since
2003 after 10 quarters of economic expansion and  profit growth 
lifted the S&P 500 109 percent since shares bottomed in March
2009. The shift reflects volatility in emerging markets and
shows how innovation builds value in the U.S.  “The U.S. is just the best place on the planet to have a
great idea and turn it into a big business,” according to
 Michael Shaoul , chairman of New York-based Marketfield Asset
Management, which oversees $2.7 billion. “There’s another
reason for this list to have shifted and that is the falling of
prior darlings,” said Shaoul, whose fund beat 99 percent of
competitors in the past year. “A lot of the ones which have
fallen are energy and emerging-market related.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
