The Chinese chamber of commerce that
monitors trade in solar-energy products called for collaboration
between the Asian nation and the European Union as trade
conflicts escalated.  “It’s time for the solar industry to push new cooperation
among countries using their comparative advantages,” Wang
Guiqing, vice president of the  China Chamber of Commerce for
Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products , said
today at a briefing in Beijing. “China and  Europe  will
definitely work together; the earlier talks start the better.”  Solarworld AG (SWV) ,  Germany ’s largest solar-panel maker, last
month led a group of manufacturers in requesting the European
Commission investigate whether Chinese rivals dumped products at
a loss on regional markets. China’s Ministry of Commerce is also
looking into a request to start anti-dumping and anti-subsidy
investigations on polysilicon bought from the EU, the official
Xinhua News Agency reported Aug. 17, citing people it didn’t
identify.  Wang didn’t specify what kind of cooperation is involved.  To contact the reporter on this story:
