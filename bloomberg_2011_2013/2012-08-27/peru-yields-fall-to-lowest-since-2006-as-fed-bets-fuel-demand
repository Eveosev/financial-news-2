Peruvian bonds rose, pushing down
yields to their lowest level in six years, as speculation the
 Federal Reserve  will expand monetary stimulus spurred demand for
higher-yielding, emerging-market assets.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 4.52 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price increased 0.19 centimo to
121.86 centimos per sol.  “We continue to see foreign investors seeking yield in the
belly of the curve on the expectation the Fed is going to act
and yields will fall further,” said Diego Alvarez, a trader at
Banco Internacional del Peru.  Treasuries rose as investors wagered Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  will use his Aug. 31 speech in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming,
to outline the case for further central bank action to support
the economy. The Fed has already conducted two rounds of asset
purchases known as quantitative easing to pump cash into the
banking system.  The sol appreciated 0.1 percent to 2.6110 per  U.S. dollar ,
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru’s central bank bought $16 million in the  spot market 
to stem gains in the currency. The bank said on its website it
paid an average 2.6110 soles per U.S. dollar.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due in March 2037 fell one basis point to 3.87
percent, according to Bloomberg prices. The bond’s price rose
0.23 cent to 142.24 cents per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
