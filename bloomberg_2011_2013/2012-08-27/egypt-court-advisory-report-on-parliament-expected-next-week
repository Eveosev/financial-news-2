An advisory body for  Egypt ’s
constitutional court is expected to complete by next week a
report on whether parliament’s upper house should be disbanded,
the court’s spokesman said.  Following the recommendation, the high court will set a
date for a hearing to determine the legality of the election law
that paved the way for Islamists to dominate the assembly, the
state-run Middle East  News Agency  cited Judge Maher Sami as
saying.  Parliament’s lower house was dissolved in June after the
same court ruled it was improperly elected, raising tensions
between incoming Islamist President Mohamed Mursi and the
generals from whom he inherited power.  Mursi, who was nominated for the presidency by the Muslim
Brotherhood, took back legislative authority from the military
council on Aug. 13, voiding a constitutional addendum they had
issued hours after polls closed in the presidential election.
Mursi’s office has defended the move and his refusal to pass on
those powers to the parliament’s upper house, arguing that the
body could be dissolved as a result of the case now before the
court.  To contact the reporters on this story:
