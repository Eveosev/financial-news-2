A tractor rammed into a van in
northwest  China  today, killing nine passengers in the van, the
state-run Xinhua News Agency reported.  The tractor was speeding and caused the collision, which
also led to a pile-up of four other vehicles, according to the
report, which cited officials in the city of Yulin.  The incident comes a day after two other deadly vehicle
accidents were reported in the same province, Shaanxi. A tanker
truck carrying methanol collided with a bus full of passengers,
killing 36 people and prompting an investigation by the State
Council, China’s Cabinet.  Five people died after a farm vehicle overturned on a
mountain road in Shaanxi’s Longxian county due to brake failure,
according to Xinhua.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
