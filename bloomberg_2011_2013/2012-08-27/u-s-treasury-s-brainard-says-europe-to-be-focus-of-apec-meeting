U.S. Treasury Undersecretary for
International Affairs Lael Brainard said the European debt
crisis will be a focus of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
meeting of finance ministers in Moscow.  “The crisis in Europe only reinforces the imperative of
the dynamic emerging economies in the Asia-Pacific region
playing a larger role” in bolstering global growth, Brainard
said.  Brainard will attend the meetings on Aug. 29-30. Treasury
Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  will not participate in the summit
this year.  Brainard also said China needs to make further progress on
its currency flexibility and has room to expand domestic demand.
“We are going to continue to want to see further movement in
the direction of a market-determined  exchange rate ,” she said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
