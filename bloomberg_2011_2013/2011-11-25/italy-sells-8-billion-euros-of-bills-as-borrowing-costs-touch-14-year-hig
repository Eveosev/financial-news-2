Italy sold inflation-linked bonds to
yield 7.3 percent, the second time in a week that the Treasury
auctioned debt above the 7 percent threshold that led  Greece ,
Portugal and Ireland to seek bailouts.  The Rome-based Treasury sold 567 million ($759 million) of
the bonds due September 2023, less than the 750 million-euro
maximum for the sale. The Treasury hasn’t sold the bonds since
March of 2010, when it paid 2.19 percent. Demand was 2.16 times
the amount sold.  Italy’s borrowing costs have surged to the highest in more
than 14 years at recent auctions as investors shunned the
country’s bonds on concern about the sustainability of Europe’s
second-biggest debt. Today’s sale came as Prime Minister  Mario
Monti  prepares additional budget measures to cut a debt of 1.9
trillion euros and boost the economy in a country where growth
has trailed the euro-region average for more than a decade.  The Treasury faces a bigger test of  market sentiment 
tomorrow, when it aims to sell as much as 8 billion euros of
bonds at three maturities, including a 10-year offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
