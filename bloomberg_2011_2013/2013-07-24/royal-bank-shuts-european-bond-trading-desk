Royal Bank of Canada , the country’s
largest lender, closed its European government-bond trading
business amid slumping returns from the region.  “This tactical adjustment in our product offering is
consistent with our strategy of being active in the markets in
which we add the most value to our clients,” Gillian McArdle, a
spokeswoman for  RBC Capital Markets , said in an e-mail
statement. The decision is effective today, the Toronto-based
lender said.  Trading revenue across the bank fell 26 percent to C$566
million ($549.6 million) in the three months ending April 30
from a year earlier, the company said in May. Chief Executive
Officer  Gordon Nixon , 56, said that the “prolonged recession”
in  Europe  affected the firm’s bottom line during the quarter.  “Trading was particularly soft in the latter part of the
quarter, due to persistent weakness, particularly in Europe,”
Nixon said in a May 30  conference call  with analysts following
results.  “Europe was extremely quiet, we basically didn’t make any
money there,” Mark Standish, co-CEO of Royal Bank’s investment
bank, said on the call.  Royal Bank gained 0.6 percent to C$65.43 at 12:16 p.m. in
Toronto. The shares have climbed 9.3 percent this year,
outpacing the 5 percent  advance  of the eight-company Standard &
Poor’s/TSX Commercial Banks Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
