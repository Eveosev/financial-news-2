South African yellow-corn futures
reached a two-month low as they followed prices in the U.S. that
slid yesterday.  Yellow corn for delivery in September fell 2.1 percent to
2,167 rand ($225) a metric ton, the contract’s lowest since May
21, by the noon close on the South African Futures Exchange in
Johannesburg. The white variety for delivery in December lost
1.7 percent to 2,320 rand a ton.  Corn futures slumped to a 33-month low yesterday on the
Chicago Board of Trade as forecasts for cool, wet weather
improved prospects for a crop expected to be a record in the
U.S., the world’s biggest grower of the grain.  “Corn was down in the U.S.,” Brink van Wyk, a trader at
BVG (Pty) Ltd., said by phone from  Pretoria . “We are following
the parity prices.”  South Africa  exported 84,537 tons of yellow corn to  Japan 
in the week to July 12, the Pretoria-based South African Grain
Information Service said on its website. If more of the yellow
variety is shipped, farmers may substitute white corn for use as
 animal feed , according to growers’ association Grain SA.  South Africa is the continent’s largest corn producer. Meal
made from white corn is one of the country’s staple foods and
yellow corn is mainly used as animal feed.  Wheat for delivery in December fell 1.4 percent to 3,303
rand a ton in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
