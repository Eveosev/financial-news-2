Colombia ’s longer-term peso bonds
dropped, pushing yields to a two-week high, as the government
increased the amount offered in fixed-rate debt auctions today.  Yields on the benchmark peso bonds due in July 2024 rose 13
basis points, or 0.13 percentage point, to 6.67 percent at 11:39
a.m. in Bogota, the highest level on a closing basis since July
10, according to the stock exchange.  “The market is reacting to the news on higher offerings,”
Jorge Cardozo, an analyst at Bogota-based brokerage Corredores
Asociados, said in a telephone interview. “Investors are
dropping bonds in the long end of the curve and are moving
toward the short end.”  Public Credit Director Michel Janna said in a July 19
interview that the government will offer at least 600 billion
pesos ($318 million) in biweekly auctions of the fixed-rate
bonds, known as TES, to reach its goal of selling 21.5 trillion
pesos of bonds this year.  Colombia offered as little as 300 billion pesos in the TES
auction June 26 as an emerging-market rout on speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve will reduce stimulus cut into the appetite
for longer-term securities. Today, Colombia’s government is
offering 600 billion pesos of peso debt.  The currency weakened less than 0.1 percent to 1,889.59 per
 U.S. dollar , extending its decline this year to 6.5 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
