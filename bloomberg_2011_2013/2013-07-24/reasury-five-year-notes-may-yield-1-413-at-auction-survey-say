The Treasury Department’s $35
billion sale of five-year notes may draw a  yield  of 1.413
percent, according to the average forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of seven of the  Federal Reserve ’s 21 primary dealers.  The securities, which mature in July 2018, yielded 1.415
percent in pre-auction trading. Bids are due by 1 p.m.  New York 
time. Last month’s sale of the securities yielded 1.484 percent
and the record auction low was 0.584 percent on July 25, 2012.  The size of today’s offering is the same as the past 34
sales of five-year notes after peaking at $42 billion from
November 2009 through April 2010.  The June 26 offering’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges
demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount offered, was
2.45, the least since September 2009. The average for the past
10 auctions was 2.8.  Indirect bidders , a class of investor that includes foreign
central banks, bought 53 percent of the notes at the June sale,
the most since January 2010. The average for the past 10
auctions is 43 percent.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 3.6 percent of
the notes at the last sale, the least since November 2009, and
compared with an average of 16.1 percent at the past 10.  Five-year notes have lost 1.8 percent this year, versus a
loss of 2.3 percent for Treasuries overall, according to Bank of
America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year securities returned
2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries overall rose 2.2 percent.  Three Auctions  Today’s offering is the second of three note auctions this
week totaling $99 billion. The government sold $35 billion in
two-year debt yesterday at a yield of 0.338 percent, and will
sell $29 billion in seven-year securities tomorrow.  The sales, plus an auction of $15 billion of 10-year
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities last week, will raise
$54.6 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by the
public total $59.4 billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  Investors have bid $2.93 for each dollar of the $1.193
trillion in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction so
far this year, according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg.
That’s down from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold
at last year’s offerings.  The Fed’s primary dealers trade  government securities  with
the central bank and are obligated to bid in Treasury auctions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
