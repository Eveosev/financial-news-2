Copper declined for the first time
in five days after a preliminary reading of manufacturing in
 China , the biggest user, fell below expectations. Aluminum, lead,
nickel and zinc also dropped.  Copper for delivery in three months fell as much as 0.8
percent to $6,986 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange and
was at $6,989.50 by 10:44 a.m. in  Shanghai . Aluminum dropped 0.8
percent to $1,830.75 a ton, while nickel slid 0.7 percent to
$14,025 a ton.  China’s manufacturing weakened further in July, signaling
the worst of the nation’s slowdown has yet to be reached. The
reading of 47.7 for an index released today by HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics, was less than estimated and if confirmed
in the final report Aug. 1, would be the lowest in 11 months.
Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  “This number will raise further concerns over Chinese
demand,” said He Shan, an analyst at Galaxy Futures Co. in
Beijing. “The second half could pose some real challenges.”  Metal for delivery in November on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange was little changed at 50,270  yuan  ($8,193) a ton.
Copper for delivery in September on the Comex fell 0.6 percent
to $3.1795 a pound.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
