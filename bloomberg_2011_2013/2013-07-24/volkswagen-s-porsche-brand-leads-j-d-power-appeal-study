Volkswagen AG (VOW)  group brands led
industrywide gains in a  J.D. Power  & Associates study of owner
satisfaction with recently purchased models as U.S. auto sales
are poised to recover to the highest level in six years.  Volkswagen, seeking to pass  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  as the
world’s biggest carmaker, led this year’s U.S. Automotive
Performance, Execution and Layout study, known as Apeal, with
five models topping their respective segments, research firm
J.D. Power said in a statement.  General Motors Co. (GM)  followed with four vehicle segment
leaders, J.D. Power said. The results of the survey, which
gauges customer satisfaction 90 days after purchases, show
buyers remain picky even as Americans purchase new cars and
trucks at the fastest rate since 2007 as they replace the oldest
vehicles ever on U.S. roads.  Vehicles with the highest Apeal scores typically sell for a
premium over segment competitors and also have higher buyer
loyalty, J.D. Power said. The firm, based in  Westlake Village ,
 California , collected responses from 83,000 car buyers between
February and May for this year’s study on 77 features, including
styling and ease of connecting a mobile phone.  Volkswagen brand Porsche AG led the study, as it did in
2012, with 884 points out of a maximum 1,000, down from 887 last
year. Volkswagen’s Audi AG followed with 857 points, up from
848. Chrysler Group LLC’s Ram truck brand was the study’s
highest non-premium line, with 817 points, up from 792 last
year.  Toyota’s luxury Lexus line rose to fifth in this year’s
study, with 847 points, a 14-point gain, from seventh last year.
Namesake Toyota brand slipped to 776 points, down from 780 in
2012, according to J.D. Power.  The industry average improved to 795 points this year from
788 in 2012, J.D. Power said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
