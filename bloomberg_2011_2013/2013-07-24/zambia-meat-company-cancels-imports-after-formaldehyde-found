Zambeef Products Plc, Zambia’s
biggest agricultural producer, has stopped importing beef
products after the health ministry said it found formaldehyde in
some samples.  “We are going to stop all imports to ensure that we
refocus our business on producing Zambian beef,” Jacob Mwanza,
the Lusaka-based company’s chairman, told reporters today in
Chisamba, north of the capital. “Zambeef will only provide beef
that will be locally grown and locally produced.”  Tests in South African laboratories confirmed imported
Zambeef products, mainly offal and hooves, contained
formaldehyde, Health Minister Joseph Kasonde said in a statement
to parliament last week. The chemical, used to embalm corpses
and found in cigarette smoke, causes cancer, according to the
Lyon, France-based International Agency for Research on Cancer.  The company’s stock, which is listed on  London , closed 2.3
percent higher at 45 pence.  Zambeef started importing beef products about four years
ago, as many of the local bovine livers are deemed unfit for
human consumption due to diseases such as liver fluke, Carl Irwin, director of strategy and development, said in an
interview today. Imported products accounted for about 4 percent
of sales, he said.  Zambeef managers and representatives from the health
ministry symbolically burnt one metric ton of imported beef at
its farm as reporters and employees looked on.  To contact the reporter on this story:
