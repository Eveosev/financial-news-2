JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  said it hired
 Yuji Fujimori , a former equity research analyst at  Barclays Plc (BARC) ,
as an investment banker for the telecommunications, media and
technology industry in Japan.  Fujimori, 43, joined JPMorgan on June 24 as an executive
director in the investment banking department, Yukako Yoshino, a
Tokyo-based spokeswoman for the U.S. bank, said in an e-mailed
response to inquiries by Bloomberg News.  JPMorgan hired Fujimori to tap his knowledge and contacts
in the technology industry accumulated during the 15 years he
worked as an analyst, according to the e-mail.
Telecommunications-related companies were the most active
acquirers and targets for Japan mergers and acquisitions last
year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  SoftBank Corp. (9984) , Japan’s third-biggest mobile phone company,
this month acquired Overland Park, Kansas-based  Sprint Corp. (S) 
 Dentsu Inc. (4324) , the Japanese advertising company that bought Aegis
Group Plc, said this month that it’s raising as much as about
120 billion yen ($1.2 billion) in a public share sale.  Fujimori joined Barclays in 2009 as an analyst for the
consumer electronics industry and previously worked at  Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  from 1998, Yoshino said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
