Delta Corporation Ltd.,  Zimbabwe ’s
biggest company by market value, said fiscal first-quarter
revenue rose 8 percent as consumers shifted to a local
traditional drink following a tax increase on lager.  Volume in the three months through June increased 4 percent
from a year earlier, with all segments recording growth except
for an 8 percent drop in lager consumption, Harare-based Delta
said today in a statement published in the Herald newspaper
today. Maheu traditional brew volume surged 80 percent,
sparkling-beverage consumption jumped 13 percent and sorghum
beer sales rose 6 percent, it said.  Lager beer sales in Zimbabwe have been curbed by an excise
duty increase in December 2012 and a lack of small coinage in a
multi-currency economy. The company said it’s in talks with the
government on the effects of the tax increase.  Delta Corporation Ltd. is an affiliate of  SABMiller Plc (SAB) ,
the world’s second-largest brewer, which holds a stake of 25
percent, according to the London-based company’s  annual report 
for the year through March.  To contact the reporters on this story:
