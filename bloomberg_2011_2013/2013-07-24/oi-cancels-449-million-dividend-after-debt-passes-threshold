Oi SA,  Brazil ’s largest landline
phone company, canceled a dividend payment of 1 billion reais
($449 million) after exceeding a self-imposed limit for
indebtedness.  The ratio of net debt to earnings, leaving out items such
as interest, exceeded 3 at the end of June, Oi said today in a
filing. The company plans to report its full second-quarter
results on Aug. 13.  Oi, based in  Rio de Janeiro , has struggled to keep debt in
check after promising investors the highest dividend yield in
the global telecommunications industry. It already paid 1
billion reais in dividends in March and had  promised  8 billion
reais in payouts between 2012 and 2015, as long as its debt
stayed below the threshold.  “There’s not a choice but to not pay the dividend,” said
 Robin Bienenstock , an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in
 London , in an interview today. “Oi could be worth more if the
dividend were reinvested in the business and in reducing the
debt.”  Oi jumped 5.2 percent to 4.63 reais at the close of trading
in  Sao Paulo , reversing a drop of as much as 6.6 percent. The
benchmark Ibovespa fell 0.9 percent.  “We view this announcement favorably,” Itau BBA analysts
including Susana Salaru wrote in a report today. “Oi has shown
discipline in respecting the self-imposed leverage limits
established in its dividend policy.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
