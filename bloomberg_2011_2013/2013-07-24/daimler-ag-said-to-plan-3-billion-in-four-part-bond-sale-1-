Daimler AG (DAI) , the maker of Mercedes-Benz cars, issued $3 billion of debt in four parts.  Daimler sold $1.25 billion of 2.375 percent, five-year
bonds to yield 105 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and $250 million of floating-rate notes with the same
maturity yielding 86 basis points more than the three-month
London interbank offered rate, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  The automaker also issued $750 million in both fixed-and
floating-rate debentures maturing in 2016, Bloomberg data show.
The 1.45 percent, fixed-rate securities pay 85 basis points more
than benchmarks while the floaters yield 68 basis points more
than Libor.  Proceeds from the sale will be used to pay inter-company
loans and for general corporate purposes, the data show. The
debt may be rated A3 by Moody’s Investors Service, according to
a person familiar with the offering, who asked not to be
identified, citing lack of authorization to speak publicly.  Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler sold debt in January that
included $1 billion of 1.875 percent, five-year bonds. The notes
traded at 99.6 cents on the dollar to yield 1.97 percent on July
18, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  The world’s third-largest maker of  luxury vehicles  posted a
second-quarter profit of 4.58 billion euros, or $6.1 billion, up
from 1.57 billion euros in the same period of 2012, the company
said today in a statement distributed by PR Newswire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
