Australia  has completed an A$80
million ($74 million) project at Torrumbarry in the state of
Victoria to deliver water to more than 17,000 hectares (42,000
acres) of forest, according to a statement.  The  Koondrook-Perricoota Forest  project included the
construction of a 3.8-kilometer (2.4 miles) inlet channel and a
43-kilometer series of levees and control regulators to divert
water in the creek system that feeds and drains the forest,
according to an e-mailed statement.  The plan, managed by the New South Wales Office of Water,
is part of the federal government’s efforts to restore the
health of the Murray River, the statement said. The project was
funded by Australia’s federal government, and the New South
Wales, Victorian, South Australian and ACT governments.  Australia’s Murray-Darling Basin covers 14 percent of the
country’s land and contains 43 percent of its farms and 11
percent of the population.  To contact the reporter on this story:
