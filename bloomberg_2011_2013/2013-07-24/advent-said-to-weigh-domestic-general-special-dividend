Buyout firm Advent International
Corp. has told bidders for Domestic & General Group Ltd. that it
plans to pay itself a special dividend if the sale of the U.K.
home-appliance insurer collapses, three people with knowledge of
the matter said.  Advent is in talks with potential buyers, including London-based private-equity firm CVC Capital Partners Ltd., to sell
Domestic & General for as much as 1 billion pounds ($1.5
billion), said the people, who asked not be identified because
the talks are private.  Domestic & General may take out new loans to pay Advent,
its owner, a dividend of as much as 150 million pounds, more
than twice the Bedworth, England-based company’s 72.7 million-pound earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization for the year ended March 2012, one person said.  Advent hired  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  to sell D&G earlier
this year and received bids from private-equity firms including
 Blackstone Group LP (BX)  and Clayton, Dubilier & Rice LLC. Concerns
over possible regulatory changes and the purchase price led some
bidders to drop out, the people said.  D&G, which was bought by Boston-based Advent for 524
million pounds in 2007, had sales of 571.8 million pounds in
2012, according to its website.  Officials at Advent, D&G, CD&R and CVC declined to comment.
A spokeswoman for Goldman Sachs and a spokesman for Blackstone
didn’t reply to e-mails and phone calls for comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
