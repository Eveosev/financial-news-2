SpiceJet Ltd. (SJET) ,  India ’s only listed
budget carrier, declined to its lowest level in almost a month
in Mumbai trading after newspapers reported Chief Executive
Officer Neil Mills resigned.  The  carrier , controlled by billionaire Kalanithi Maran,
fell as much as 3.3 percent to 26.50 rupees, poised for its
lowest price since June 27. The shares dropped 2.4 percent to
26.75 rupees as of 10:07 a.m. The benchmark S&P BSE Sensex slid
0.4 percent.  Mills, who joined SpiceJet in October 2010, is attending
office as he’s waiting to be relieved, the Times of India
newspaper reported without saying where it got the information.
The carrier will not comment on “market rumors,” spokeswoman
Priti Dey said by phone from  New Delhi  yesterday when asked
about the CEO’s resignation. Mills didn’t respond to calls made
to his mobile phone today and yesterday.  In June, Nikos Kardassis resigned as CEO of  Jet Airways
(India) Ltd. (JETIN) , the nation’s biggest publicly-traded carrier.
Indian airlines have been trying to attract funds from foreign
carriers after the government eased ownership rules.  Jet Airways in April agreed to sell a stake to Etihad
Airways PJSC. Mills had previously said SpiceJet was looking for
investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
