Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , owner of the second-largest credit rater, reported second-quarter earnings that rose
31 percent on higher bond issuance, boosting demand for the
grades.  Net income rose to $225.5 million, or $1 a share, from
$172.5 million, or 76 cents a share, a year earlier, New York-based Moody’s said today in a statement distributed by  Business
Wire . Shares have climbed 24 percent this year to $62.31.  Demand for ratings services has boosted earnings as

America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield Index.

York, said in a telephone interview before the release. “June
was a weak month, but before June, business was just
tremendously strong.”  Sales Slowdown  While issuance slowed in June amid rising interest rates on
concern the  Federal Reserve  will pare its $85 billion of monthly

Asia increased 18 percent to $911.7 billion in the second
quarter from a year earlier, Bloomberg data show.  Moody’s, whose founder John Moody help start the credit
