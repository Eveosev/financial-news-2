Vietnamese stocks fell, with the
benchmark index dropping the most in four weeks, after inflation
accelerated at the fastest pace since May 2012.  The Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange’s  VN Index (VNINDEX)  retreated
1.8 percent to 495.28 at 10:51 a.m. local time, poised for the
sharpest decline since June 25.  Joint-Stock Commercial Bank for
Foreign Trade of Vietnam  tumbled 1.8 percent, the most since
July 1. Bao Viet Holdings, the country’s biggest listed insurer,
dropped 2 percent, poised for a second day of losses.  Consumer prices  rose 7.29 percent this month from a year
earlier, according to data released by the General Statistics
Office in Hanoi today. That compares with the median 7.1 percent
estimate of six economists in a Bloomberg survey.  “Inflation figures were higher than expected and people
are afraid that prices may continue rising next month, when the
recent increase in gasoline prices will be fully reflected,”
Giang Trung Kien, Hanoi-based head of research at FPT Securities
Joint-Stock Co. said by phone.  Vietnam  National Petroleum Corp., known as Petrolimex, the
country’s biggest fuel retailer, raised prices of its most
commonly used 92-RON gasoline by 1.9 percent on July 17.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
