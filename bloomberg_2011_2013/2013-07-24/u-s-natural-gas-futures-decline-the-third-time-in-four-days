Natural gas futures declined for the
third time in four days in  New York .  Gas for August delivery fell as much as 0.7 percent to
$3.717 per million British thermal units in electronic trading
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $3.720 at 11:31
a.m. Singapore time. The contract rose 1.8 percent yesterday to
$3.743 on speculation that a heat wave last week reduced U.S.
stockpile gains.  “The weather has moderated greatly, thus gas demand is now
much lower, and hence the inability for gas bulls to push the
market higher,” said  Stephen Schork , the president of Schork
Group Inc., a consultant in Villanova, Pennsylvania.  Electricity generators are the largest U.S. consumer of
gas, accounting for 32 percent of demand, according to the
Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the
Energy Department.  To contact the reporter on this story:
