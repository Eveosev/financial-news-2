Time Warner Cable Inc. (TWC) ’s talks to
take a 25 percent stake in the video website Hulu LLC have been
called off for now, a person with knowledge of the matter said.  While discussions may resume, nothing is planned, said  the
person, who asked not to be identified because the matter is
private. Time Warner Cable was among the suitors for Hulu before
its owners called off a sale this month.  Time Warner Cable, the second-largest U.S. cable system,
continued to discuss a possible investment in Hulu alongside
owners  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) , 21st Century Fox Inc. and  Comcast
Corp. (CMCSA) ’s NBCUniversal. A stake in Hulu would bolster its high-speed Internet product and hedge against potential cable-TV
cancellations. Hulu Plus customers pay $8 a month for on-demand
programming. The three owners have agreed to invest $750 million
in the website.  Bidders for Hulu included  DirecTV (DTV) , Peter Chernin and
Guggenheim Digital. Reuters reported earlier on the breakdown of
the most recent talks with Time Warner Cable.  To contact the reporters on this story:
