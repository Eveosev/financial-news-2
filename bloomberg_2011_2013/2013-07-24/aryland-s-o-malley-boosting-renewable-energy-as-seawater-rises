Maryland Governor  Martin O’Malley 
plans to boost demand for renewable energy and slow emissions of
 greenhouse gases  that contributed to a one-foot (30-centimeter)
rise in the state’s sea levels over a century.  O’Malley will ask state lawmakers to require utilities buy
25 percent of their electricity from solar and wind power by
2020, up from the current 20 percent by 2022. The target was
included in a  report  released by the governor’s office today.  O’Malley will discuss how Maryland will meet its goal of
cutting greenhouse-gas emissions 25 percent below 2006 levels
over the next seven years in a speech on climate change
tomorrow. The investments in renewable energy and energy
efficiency will produce economic benefits of $1.6 billion and
support more than 37,000 jobs, according to the plan.  He also will set a goal to reduce peak power demand 15
percent by 2015 through energy-efficiency programs that improve
home and office insulation and appliances.  To contact the reporter on this story:
