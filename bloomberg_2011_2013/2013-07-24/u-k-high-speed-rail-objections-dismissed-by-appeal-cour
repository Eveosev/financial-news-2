Work on the planned high-speed rail
line from  London  to northern  England  will continue after the
Court of Appeal dismissed further objections, the Department for
Transport said.  The court in London ruled in the government’s favor on
seven challenges brought by three groups of claimants to the
line, known as HS2, and the route for the first phase from
London to Birmingham, the ministry said in an  e-mailed statement 
today. The appeal hearings took place last month.  “This is the second time in four months a court has
rejected attempts to derail HS2,” High-Speed Rail Minister
Simon Burns said in the statement. “I urge opponents not to
waste any more taxpayers’ money on expensive litigation and
instead work with us on making HS2 the very best it can be.”  Construction of the route is scheduled to start in 2017.
The line from London to Birmingham is scheduled to open in 2026,
with traffic starting on extensions to Manchester and Leeds by
2033. The government said last month that construction will cost
42.6 billion pounds ($65 billion) and the trains for the line
7.5 billion pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
