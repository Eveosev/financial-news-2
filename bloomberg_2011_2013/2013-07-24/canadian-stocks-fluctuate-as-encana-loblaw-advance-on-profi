Canadian  stocks  were little changed
after better-than-expected earnings from  Encana (ECA)  Corp. and Loblaw
Cos. offset a slump in raw-materials producers as  China 
manufacturing slowed.  Encana rose 0.5 percent after posting its first quarterly
profit in more than a year. Loblaw,  Canada ’s largest grocer,
gained 1.6 percent as profit climbed on higher food and clothing
sales.  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B) , Canada’s largest wireless
carrier, advanced 2.2 percent as sales climbed during the
quarter. Agnico Eagle Mines Ltd. and Barrick Gold Corp. led
declines among commodity shares, losing at least 2.2 percent.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  lost 5.43 points,
or less than 0.1 percent, to 12,739.95 at 9:59 a.m. in Toronto.
The gauge has gained 2.5 percent this year.  China’s manufacturing weakened more than estimated in July,
according to a preliminary purchasing managers’ index reading of
47.7 released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics. Levels
below 50 indicate contraction.  Cenovus Energy Inc. sank 3.4 percent as second-quarter
profit slumped 55 percent on higher currency losses and lower
hedging gains.  To contact the reporter on this story:
