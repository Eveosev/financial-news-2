Shares of  Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , owner of
the second-largest credit rater, surged by the most since April
after recording a 31 percent increase in profits.  Moody’s rose 4.04 percent to $64.83 at 1:19 p.m. in  New
York  as the company reported second-quarter earnings climbed on
higher bond issuance, which boosted demand for its credit
grades.  Earlier, shares  climbed  as much as 7.6 percent to $67.05,
the largest intraday move since April 29. Net income increased
to $225.5 million, or $1 a share, up from $172.5 million, or 76
cents a share in the same period in 2012, the New York-based
company said in a statement distributed by  Business Wire .  Moody’s, whose founder John Moody helped start the credit
ratings business in 1909, reported revenue of $537.3 million
from grading debt, advancing from $441.2 million in the second
quarter 2012, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Sales
from grading companies increased 37 percent to $262.9 million
from $191.5 million. Structured finance rankings rose 7 percent
to $97.2 million from $90.7 million.  Borrowing Costs  Demand for ratings services has boosted earnings as
companies take advantage of borrowing costs that reached a
record low last quarter. Yields on corporate bonds fell to an
unprecedented 3.09 percent on May 2, according to the Bank of
America Merrill Lynch Global Corporate & High Yield Index.
Global issuance of $2 trillion in the first six months exceeded
offerings for the period in 2012, when a record $3.98 trillion
was sold for the full year, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Bond issuance in the first half was phenomenal,”  Ed Atorino , a media analyst at research firm Benchmark Co. in New
York, said in a telephone interview before the release. “June
was a weak month, but before June, business was just
tremendously strong.”  While issuance slowed in June amid rising interest rates on
concern the  Federal Reserve  will pare its $85 billion of monthly
bond buying, corporate bond sales from the U.S. to Europe to
Asia increased 25 percent to $965 billion in the second quarter
from a year earlier, Bloomberg data show.  McGraw Hill Financial Inc. (MHFI) , the parent company of  Standard
& Poor’s , the world’s largest credit rater, reports second-quarter earnings before the market opens tomorrow.  To contact the reporters on this story:
