Bridgepoint Education Inc. (BPI) , the
college company majority-owned by Warburg Pincus LLC, was sued
by California to turn over information about its sales efforts
to officials investigating the for-profit education industry.  Bridgepoint, based in San Diego, has refused to produce
data from a computer system that collects information about its
telemarketing efforts, California Attorney General  Kamala Harris ’s office said in a petition filed today in state court in
Sacramento. Harris subpoenaed the company for the information in
January.  “The Attorney General requested these specific materials
in order to evaluate whether Bridgepoint has violated California
law by making false or misleading statements to Californians
during the telephone calls, including telemarketing calls, and
through other sales and marketing efforts,” Deputy Attorney
General Angela Munoz said in the petition, a copy of which was
supplied by her office.  The petition couldn’t immediately be confirmed through
court records.  Marianne Perez, a Bridgepoint spokeswoman, declined to
comment.  The case is People of the State of California v.
Bridgepoint Education Inc., California Superior Court,
Sacramento County (Sacramento).  To contact the reporter on this story:
