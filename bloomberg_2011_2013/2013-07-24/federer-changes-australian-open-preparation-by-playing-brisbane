Roger Federer  will tune-up for his
bid to win a fifth Australian Open tennis title by playing the
Brisbane International for the first time.  Federer, the winner of a record 17 men’s Grand Slam singles
championships, will start his 2014 season at the Dec. 29-Jan. 5
event, tournament organizers said today. The Australian Open
starts Jan. 13.  It’s the first time since 2003 that Switzerland’s Federer,
31, has played an official tour event in  Australia  before the
season-opening major at Melbourne Park, where he’s reached at
least the semifinals in the past 10 editions.  Federer’s record run of 36 straight Grand Slam quarterfinal
appearances ended last month with a second-round upset loss at
Wimbledon to Sergiy Stakhovsky of Ukraine. His current ATP
ranking of No. 5 is his lowest in a decade.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
