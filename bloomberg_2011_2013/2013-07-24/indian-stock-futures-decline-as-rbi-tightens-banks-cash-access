Indian (SENSEX)  equities fell, dragging a
gauge of banks to a 10-month low, on concern the new liquidity
tightening measures taken by the central bank to support the
rupee will increase borrowing costs.  Yes Bank Ltd. (YES)  tumbled the most in more than four years,
pushing the S&P BSE Bankex to its lowest level since September.
Eight of the 13 stocks on the gauge slumped at least 5 percent.
 State Bank of India  slid 3.2 percent, depressing the stock’s
price-to-book ratio to 1, the lowest reading since April 2009.  The S&P BSE Sensex retreated 1 percent to 20,090.68 at the
close, after climbing to a 30-month high yesterday. The Reserve
Bank of  India  limited banks’ access to cash and increased the
daily balance requirement for the reserve ratio, stepping up
efforts to steady the rupee which slid to a record this month.
The RBI on July 15 raised two interest rates and moved to drain
money through bond sales, joining emerging nations from  Brazil 
to  Indonesia  in tightening credit to stabilize currencies.  “Profitability of lenders will get hit due to compression
in net interest margins, lower economic growth and rising bad
loans,” Aneesh Srivastava, chief investment officer at IDBI
Federal Life Insurance Co. in Mumbai, said in a phone interview
today. “Tighter liquidity will hurt economic growth further.”  Yes Bank plunged 13 percent to 383.35 rupees, the sharpest
drop since October 2008. The lender’s  net income  in the three
months ended June 30 climbed 38 percent to 4.01 billion rupees,
according to an exchange filing. That beat the adjusted median
estimate of 3.79 billion rupees in a Bloomberg survey.  The stock was the worst performer on the S&P BSE Bankex,
which sank 4.6 percent to its lowest close since Sept. 14. The
gauge has slid 18 percent from a record reached on May 15.  ‘About Turn’  The recent moves by Reserve Bank Governor Duvvuri Subbarao
contrast with his decisions to cut the benchmark interest rate
by 25 basis points each in January, March and May, in a bid to
fight the weakest economic growth in a decade. He left the rate
unchanged at 7.25 percent in June. The next review is on July
30.  “There’s a halt in the march of private-sectors banks”
because of an “about turn” in the central bank’s monetary
policy, Raamdeo Agrawal, joint managing director of Motilal
Oswal Financial Services Ltd. in Mumbai, said in an interview to
Bloomberg TV India today.  State Bank retreated 3.2 percent to 1,801.25 rupees, a
seven-month low.  ICICI Bank Ltd. (ICICIBC) , the nation’s second-biggest
lender, lost 3.8 percent to 951.8 rupees.  HDFC Bank Ltd., (HDFCB)  the
biggest by market value, lost 3.5 percent to 659.95 rupees.  Engineering company  Larsen & Toubro Ltd. (LT)  retreated for the
fourth day, losing 3.8 percent to 867.35 rupees.  Maruti Suzuki
India Ltd. (MSIL) , the nation’s largest carmaker, plunged 2.3 percent
to 1,416.05 rupees. Copper and zinc producer  Sterlite Industries
(India) Ltd. (STLT)  tumbled 3.1 percent to 81.95 rupees.  Earnings Scorecard  The Sensex has climbed 8.3 percent since June 26, helped by
better-than-estimated corporate earnings. Six out the eight
index members that have reported earnings so far for the June
quarter beat analysts estimates. About 27 percent of companies
in the gauge missed forecasts for the three months ended March,
compared with 43 percent in the quarter through December.  The 30-stock gauge  trades  at 14.1 times projected 12-month
earnings, the most expensive since February 2012, compared with
the MSCI  Emerging Markets  Index’s 10.2 times.  Global funds  bought $37 million of local shares on July 23,
taking this year’s net purchases to $12.4 billion, data compiled
by Bloomberg show. They have sold a net $961 million of domestic
stocks this month, the most among 10 Asian markets tracked by
Bloomberg, extending June’s $1.8 billion sell-off.  The CNX Nifty Index on the National Stock Exchange of India
Ltd. plunged 1.4 percent to 5,990.50. India VIX, which gauges
the cost of protection against losses in the Nifty, rose 1.1
percent, ending a four-day slide.  To contact the reporter on this story:
