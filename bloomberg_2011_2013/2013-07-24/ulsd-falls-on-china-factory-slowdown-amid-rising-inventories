Ultra-low-sulfur diesel fell along
with crude oil as a slowdown in manufacturing in  China  pointed
to lower demand and on speculation a government report today
will show rising distillate fuel inventories.  Futures slipped as China’s manufacturing weakened more than
estimated in July, according to a preliminary survey of
 purchasing managers . The Energy Department will probably report
today that distillate stockpiles rose 1.85 million barrels last
week, according to the median estimate of 12 analysts in a
survey by Bloomberg. Supplies were the highest since Feb. 1 in
the prior week, EIA data show.  “The market is being weighed on by Chinese manufacturing
figures coming in lower than expected and anything that reflects
slowing growth in  Asia  will impact on demand for crude oil,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  Ultra-low-sulfur diesel for August delivery fell 1.63
cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.053 a gallon at 9:57 a.m. on the
 New York Mercantile Exchange  on trading volume that was 9.7
percent below the 100-day average.  ULSD’s  crack spread  versus West Texas Intermediate crude
slipped 1 cent to $21.81 a barrel. The  premium over Brent  rose
28 cents to $20.91.  Gasoline, the best performer this month in the Standard &
Poor’s GSCI  index  of 24 commodities, fell as the EIA may report
gasoline inventories rose 1.65 million barrels last week,
according to the survey.  August-delivery gasoline fell 1.37 cents, or 0.5 percent,
to $3.0454 a gallon on trading volume that was 46 percent below
the 100-day average.  Gasoline’s  crack spread  versus WTI widened 16 cents to
$20.15 a barrel. The fuel’s  premium  to Brent gained 47 cents to
$19.27 a barrel.  Pump prices , averaged nationwide, fell 0.6 cent to $3.66 a
gallon, Heathrow, Florida-based AAA said today on its website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
