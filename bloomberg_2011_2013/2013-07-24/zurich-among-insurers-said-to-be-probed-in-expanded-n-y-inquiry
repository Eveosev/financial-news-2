Zurich Insurance Group AG (ZURN)  is among
companies being questioned by New York’s insurance regulator in
a widening probe into compliance with an Iran sanctions law,
according to a person familiar with the matter.  The state Department of Financial Services is asking
insurers to explain their policies and procedures to avoid
violations of the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act of
2012, according to the person. The act took effect July 1.  “The resulting sanctions could jeopardize the ability of
any involved insurer to conduct business in the United States,”
the department said in a letter to the insurers obtained by
Bloomberg News. “Recently, the Department learned that several
companies have insured trades made with Iran.”  The regulator, led by Superintendent  Benjamin Lawsky ,
contacted a group of insurers in June about compliance with the
law. That group included  Swiss Reinsurance Co. (SREN)  and Lloyd’s of
London.  Besides Zurich, other companies contacted in the newest
letter are American International Overseas Ltd., AXA Global
Risks, and St. Paul Reinsurance Co. Ltd.  To contact the reporters on this story:
