The euro advanced against the
majority of 16 most-traded peers after purchasing-manager
indexes showed manufacturing in the currency bloc unexpectedly
expanded in July, bolstering demand for the region’s assets.  The dollar climbed versus the yen for the first time in
three days as U.S. Treasury yields increased, boosting the
greenback’s allure. The euro slipped versus the American
currency after data showed U.S. sales of new homes rose more
than forecast. The  European Central Bank  meets Aug. 1. A gauge
of  volatility  among Group-of-Seven currencies was up for the
first time in 10 days. New Zealand’s dollar gained as the
nation’s central bank held its key interest rate at 2.5 percent.  “We saw the PMI readings surprise to the upside,” Eric Viloria, senior currency strategist at Gain Capital Group LLC in
 New York , said in a telephone interview. “If we see a pickup in
growth, the ECB policy makers might not need to implement
additional tools under consideration, and that’s something from
a policy standpoint that’s going to support the currency.”  The euro gained 0.7 percent to 132.35 yen at 5 p.m. New
York time and touched 132.74, the strongest since May 23.
 Europe ’s common currency advanced as much as 0.3 percent to
$1.3256, the highest level since June 20, before falling 0.2
percent to $1.3201. The dollar rose 0.8 percent to 100.27 yen.  Benchmark U.S.  10-year (USGG10YR)  note yields touched 2.62 percent,
the highest level in more than a week, as prices fell amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will reduce its bond purchases
this year as the economy improves. Yields on comparable  Japanese (GJGB10) 
government debt touched 0.77 percent for a second day, the
lowest level since May 14.  Volatility Increases  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s G-7  Volatility Index , a measure of
currency fluctuations, rose to 9.4 percent after falling earlier
to 9.11 percent, the least since May 9. The gauge climbed to
this year’s high of 11.96 percent on June 24.  Trading in over-the-counter foreign-exchange options
totaled $24 billion, compared with $24 billion yesterday,
according to data reported by U.S. banks to the Depository Trust
Clearing Corp. and tracked by Bloomberg. Volume in options on
the dollar-yen  exchange rate  amounted to $3.4 billion, the
largest share of trades at 14 percent. Options on the
Australian-U.S.-dollar rate totaled $2 billion, or 9 percent.  Dollar-yen options trading was 47 percent less than the
average for the past five Wednesdays at a similar time in the
day, according to Bloomberg analysis. Aussie-U.S.-dollar options
trading was 18 percent less than average.  New Zealand’s dollar rose 0.5 percent to 79.66 U.S. cents.  Aussie, Real  The Australian dollar and Brazilian real slid versus most
major currencies after manufacturing in  China , both nations’
biggest trading partner, contracted more than forecast. The
reading of 47.7 for July in a purchasing-managers index released
by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics, if confirmed in the
final report Aug. 1, would be the lowest in 11 months.  “Troubling developments in China are a burden upon the
Australian dollar,”  Neil Mellor , a currency strategist at Bank
of New York Mellon in  London , wrote in a note to clients.  The Aussie dropped 1.4 percent to 91.63 U.S. cents after
declining to 89.99 cents on July 12, the weakest level since
September 2010.  Brazil’s currency lost against the greenback for the first
time in three days, sliding 1.6 percent to 2.2505 per dollar and
reaching 2.2573, the weakest since July 17.  The euro gained after manufacturing gauges for the 17-nation region and for  Germany (PMITMGE) , its biggest economy, unexpectedly
showed expansion. The index for the euro area rose to 50.1 from
48.8 in June, London-based Markit Economics said. Economists in
a Bloomberg survey predicted 49.1. A level above 50 signals
expansion. In Germany, the gauge rose to 50.3, from 48.6 in
June, Markit said. A Bloomberg survey forecast a rise to 49.2.  ‘Upside Surprises’  “If you look at how euro-region data has progressed
recently, we’ve tended to see more upside surprises,” said
 Steve Barrow , head of Group of 10 research at Standard Bank Plc
in London. “There’s a relative improvement in the perception of
euro-zone data, which is helping the euro.”  The shared currency has advanced 2.9 percent in the past
three months among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen rose 0.5
percent, and the dollar gained 1.4 percent.  ECB President  Mario Draghi  said after policy makers’ last
meeting that options for further easing include charging banks
for depositing money, reviving the market for asset-backed
securities and providing investors with greater guidance on
 interest rates . The benchmark rate is a record-low 0.5 percent.  Rupiah Slides  Indonesia’s rupiah slumped to a four-year low on concern
the current-account deficit will widen as export demand wanes.  The currency declined 0.6 percent to 10,260 per dollar
after depreciating to 10,276, the weakest level since July 2009.
It dropped yesterday by the most in 13 months as  Bank Indonesia 
allowed a more rapid decline toward levels quoted in the
offshore market.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index  extended a gain after sales of
new U.S. homes rose more than forecast to the highest level in
five years.  Purchases (NHSLTOT)  climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized pace
of 497,000 homes, the Commerce Department said today in
 Washington , from a revised 459,000 in May. The median estimate
of economists in a Bloomberg survey was for a gain to 484,000.  The currency gauge, which tracks the greenback against 10
other major currencies, rose 0.5 percent to 1,030.94 after
falling to 1,025.46 yesterday, the lowest since June 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
