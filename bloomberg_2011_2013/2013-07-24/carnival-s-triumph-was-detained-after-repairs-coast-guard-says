Carnival Corp. (CCL) ’s Triumph, the cruise
ship that was stranded in the Gulf of Mexico with passengers
aboard in February, was detained after repairs because the U.S.
Coast Guard found deficiencies, an agency official said.  The Coast Guard found “three serious deficiencies” in its
first inspection, Rear Admiral Joseph Servidio, assistant
commandant for prevention policy, testified at a Senate
Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee hearing today.
The problems were corrected and the ship will be subject to
quarterly examinations for three years, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
