A case of 2009 Chateau Leoville-Las
Cases, a second-growth wine estate in the Saint-Julien region of
Bordeaux, sold for 1,880 pounds ($2,890) on Liv-ex, a three-month high and 7 percent up from a record low in April.  The transaction yesterday, while 21 percent below the 2,375
pounds a case at which it traded in June 2010 as the wine went
on sale, took the vintage back to the upper part of the trading
band it has established in the past six months.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index, a benchmark for top Bordeaux
wines, fell 2 percent in the second quarter after gaining 7
percent in the first three months, and has slipped further
during July. Leoville-Las Cases consistently ranks among the
more expensive of the Medoc second-growths, along with estates
including Chateau Cos d’Estournel.  “The first growths and super-seconds continue to lead the
way,” Paul Hart, chief executive officer of Chicago-based Hart
Davis Hart Wine Co., said in a phone interview this month,
citing “good strength” in the market.  The 2009 Leoville-Las Cases ranks as one of the estate’s
three most expensive vintages of the past 15 years, according to
merchant prices collated by  Liv-ex  on its Cellar Watch website.  The vintage was awarded a 98+ rating on a 100-point scale
by U.S. critic  Robert Parker , making it the highest-ranked
Leoville-Las Cases wine of the past seven years, according to
the eRobertParker.com  website .  Saint-Julien  Leoville-Las Cases, on the left bank of the Gironde
estuary, has about 97 hectares (240 acres) planted with
vineyards, mainly  Cabernet Sauvignon  and including Merlot and
Cabernet Franc. It also makes a second wine, Clos du Marquis.  Leoville-Las Cases was designated a second-growth in the
1855 classification of Medoc wines.  To contact the reporter on this story:
