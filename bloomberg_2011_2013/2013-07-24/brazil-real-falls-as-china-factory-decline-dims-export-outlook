Brazil’s real  dropped after a report
showed manufacturing declined in China, the South American
nation’s biggest trading partner.  The currency fell for the first time in three days,
depreciating 0.8 percent to 2.2316 per dollar at 10:24 a.m. in
 Sao Paulo . Swap rates due in January climbed one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 8.75 percent, reversing declines.  “Even though the Chinese government has showed commitment
to expanding the economy, the concrete data from the country
aren’t showing that it’s happening,”  Reginaldo Galhardo ,
currency manager at Treviso Corretora de Cambio, said in a phone
interview from Sao Paulo.  Brazil’s  unemployment rate  rose to 6 percent in June from
5.8 percent in the previous month, Brazil’s statistics agency
reported today. The median forecast of 27 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg was 5.8 percent.  The preliminary reading of 47.7 for China’s purchasing
managers’ index released by  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit
Economics compares with the 48.2 median forecast of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Readings below 50 indicate a contraction
of manufacturing.  Chinese Premier  Li Keqiang ’s efforts to rein in credit,
property prices and officials’ spending risk worsening a slump
even as state media say 7.5 percent growth is the lower limit
for this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
