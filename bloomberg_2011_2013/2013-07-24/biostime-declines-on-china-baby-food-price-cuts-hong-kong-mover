Biostime International Holdings
Ltd. (1112) , one of the baby food makers under China’s probe for
possible price fixing, fell the most in almost three weeks in
 Hong Kong  trading after pledging to cut some prices as much as
10 percent.  Biostime fell as much as 7.9 percent to HK$35.65 in Hong
Kong trading today, the most since July 4 before trading at
HK$37.10 at 11:18 a.m. local time. The city’s benchmark Hang
Seng Index lost 0.5 percent.  The company’s subsidiary in the southern Chinese city of
Guangzhou, where Biostime is based, will lower prices of its
infant formula products by 5 percent to 10 percent, the company
said in a stock exchange statement yesterday. Biostime earlier
this month said it would offer discounts of 11 percent on baby
food through reward points.  Biostime is the only domestic milk powder company that was
named earlier this month in the Chinese government’s
investigation into possible price fixing. The others included
 Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. (MJN) , Danone,  Nestle SA (NESN) ’s Wyeth brand,
Abbott Laboratories and Dutch producer Royal FrieslandCampina
NV. They have all reduced prices since, some by as much as 20
percent. The probe is ongoing, Biostime said yesterday.  Biostime has signed new distribution agreements with all
its distributors to comply with China’s anti-monopoly law, it
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
