American Express Co. (AXP) , the biggest
credit-card issuer by purchases, sold $3 billion of bonds in its
third benchmark dollar-denominated offering this year.  The company’s $1 billion of 1.3 percent, three-year
securities yield 68 basis points more than similar-maturity
Treasuries and its $800 million of 2.125 percent, five-year
notes pay a relative yield of 78 basis points, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Its $1.2 billion of three-year, floating-rate debt pay 51 basis points more than the three-month London
interbank offered rate.  American Express last sold benchmark securities in May,
issuing $1.85 billion in two parts including $1 billion of 1.55
percent debentures due May 2018 with a relative yield of 75
basis points, Bloomberg data show. The bonds traded at 98.35
cents on the dollar to yield 1.91 percent on July 22, according
to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.  Barclays Plc, Citigroup Inc., Deutsche Bank AG and Wells
Fargo & Co. managed the offering for the New York-based company,
Bloomberg data show. The debt is expected to be rated A2 by
Moody’s Investors Service.  Benchmark sales are typically at least $500 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
