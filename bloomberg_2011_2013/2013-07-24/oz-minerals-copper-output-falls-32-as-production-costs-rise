OZ Minerals Ltd. (OZL) ,  Australia ’s third-biggest copper producer, said second-quarter production fell 32
percent from a year ago, missing analysts’ estimates, as it
retained its full-year target.  Output was 17,379 metric tons in the three months to June
30, from 25,521 metric tons a year earlier, the Melbourne-based
company said today in a statement. The median estimate of four
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was 20,600 metric tons.  Cash costs rose to $1.95 per pound from $1.18 in the same
quarter a year ago, the company said. OZ Minerals is cutting
jobs and has delayed a decision on whether to develop its
Carrapateena project, citing rising labor and equipment costs. A
total of 61 jobs were cut last month at the Prominent Hill mine,
it said.  “Lower labor costs are expected in the second half of the
year with the reduced headcount,” the company said in the
statement.  OZ Minerals cut its full-year gold production forecast to
120,000 ounces to 130,000 ounces, from 130,000 ounces to 150,000
ounces. The company produced 31,018 ounces of gold in the three
months ended June 30, compared with 34,475 ounces a year earlier,
it said in the statement.  Copper production was lower as a result of a slip in the
overburden of the south wall in Prominent Hill’s open pit, it
said. “The expectation is that the second half of the year will
have higher production levels than the first half,” the company
said in the statement.  OZ Minerals reiterated its full-year copper production
forecast of 82,000 tons to 88,000 tons. It revised down in April
a previous forecast of 90,000 tons to 95,000 tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
