Cia. Pernambucana de Saneamento , a
Brazilian water utility, agreed to build a 74-kilometer (46-mile) pipeline to the northeastern city of Arcoverde as part of
a government effort to cut shortages and rationing.  The water pipeline will take eight months to link two wells
in Ibirinim currently under construction, Arcoverde said today
on its  website . Three wells in neighboring cities also will be
expanded to help alleviate water scarcity in the area.  The federal government will provide 41 million reais ($18.4
million) for the works and Compasa, as the utility is known,
will administer funds for the project, Teresa Padilha, a
spokeswoman for Arcoverde, said today in a phone interview. Some
areas of the city need to ration water use for 17 of every 20
days, according to a statement.  The five wells will more than double water supplies to
Arcoverde and the region, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
