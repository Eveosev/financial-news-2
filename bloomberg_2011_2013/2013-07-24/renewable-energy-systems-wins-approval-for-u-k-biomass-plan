Renewable Energy Systems Ltd., a
power plant developer, won approval from the U.K. government to
build a 99.9 megawatt biomass facility at Blyth Harbor in
Northumberland.  The Department of Energy and Climate Change said the unit
developed by the companyâ€™s subsidiary North Blythe Energy Ltd.
will generate enough electricity for 170,000 homes a year, the
equivalent of all the homes in Northumberland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
