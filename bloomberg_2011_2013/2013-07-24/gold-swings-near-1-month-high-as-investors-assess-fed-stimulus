Gold climbed toward a one-month high
in New York as the dollar’s slump and speculation the  Federal
Reserve  will maintain stimulus spurred demand for the metal.  The Bloomberg  Dollar Index , a measure against 10 major
currencies, was little changed near a one-month low after a
report showed manufacturing in the euro area’s 17-nation
currency bloc unexpectedly expanded in July. Manufacturing in
the region covered by the Fed Bank of Richmond unexpectedly
shrank in July, data showed yesterday.  Gold slid 20 percent this year, set for the first annual
drop in 13 years and wiping $56.6 billion from the value of gold
 exchange-traded product holdings , after some investors lost
faith in the metal as a store of value. Gold futures rose 9.7
percent in July, set for the best month since January 2012,
after Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said it’s too early to decide
whether to begin scaling back  bond purchases  in September.  “The renewed depreciation of the U.S dollar is shoring up
gold,” analysts at Commerzbank AG wrote today in a report.
“The risk of an abrupt end to the U.S. Fed’s quantitative
easing monetary loosening policy has dwindled again recently.
Gold is likely to find it relatively difficult to rise above the
$1,400 mark, for we believe this would require the ongoing
selling by gold ETF investors to come to an end.”  Gold for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $1,342.90 an
ounce by 7:47 a.m. on the Comex in New York. Prices reached
$1,349.20 yesterday, the highest since June 20. Futures trading
volume was 12 percent above the average for the past 100 days
for this time of day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Gold for immediate delivery in  London  lost 0.2 percent to
$1,342.76.  ETP Holdings  Gold ETP holdings fell 2.8 metric tons to 1,971.7 tons
yesterday, the lowest since May 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. The Fed currently buys $85 billion of debt each month.  “After the recent rally, bullion may consolidate in the
near term,” said Mark To, head of research at Wing Fung
Financial Group, a Hong Kong-based precious metals trader and
refiner. “Gold has been pressured by the expectation of a
slowdown in the pace of asset purchases by the Fed. Any sign of
weakness in the  U.S. economy  will help gold.”  Silver for September delivery rose 0.4 percent to $20.335
an ounce in  New York . Palladium for September delivery fell 0.3
percent to $737.10 an ounce. Platinum for October delivery was
0.4 percent higher at $1,448.90 an ounce.  To contact the reporters on this story:
