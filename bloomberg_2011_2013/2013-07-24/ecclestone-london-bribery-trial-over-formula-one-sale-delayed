A bribery trial over  Bernie Ecclestone ’s role in the 2005 sale of a  Bayerische Landesbank 
stake in Formula One racing to CVC Capital Partners Ltd. will be
delayed as long as three weeks.  Constantin Medien AG (EV4)  can take more time to review
additional documents surrounding the 2005 deal, delaying the
trial until as late as Oct. 28, Judge Geoffrey Vos said at a
hearing in London today.  Constantin is suing the Formula One head Ecclestone and
Gerhard Gribkowsky, the former risk manager of Bayerische
Landesbank, for damages, claiming BayernLB’s Formula One shares
were sold too cheaply because Ecclestone bribed Gribkowsky.  German prosecutors charged Ecclestone with bribery and
inciting another person to commit breach of trust July 17. A
German court will determine whether the charges may go to trial.  Gribkowsky, who managed the lender’s interest in Formula
One, said in a German court he was paid $44 million to steer the
sale of the bank’s 47 percent stake in the racing circuit to
CVC, a U.K.-based buyout firm, and agreed to a sham contract
under which Ecclestone received a kickback.  Gribkowsky was convicted of taking bribes from Ecclestone
and sentenced to 8 1/2 years in German prison last year.  The case is: Constantin Medien AG v. Bernard Ecclestone,
case no. 11-02586,  High Court  of Justice,  Chancery Division .  To contact the reporter on this story:
