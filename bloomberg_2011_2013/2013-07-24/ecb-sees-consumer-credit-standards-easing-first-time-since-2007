The European Central Bank said euro-area banks eased credit standards for loans to consumers for the
first time since the end of 2007.  A measure of consumer credit standards climbed to a net
easing last quarter from a net tightening in the three months
ended March, the Frankfurt-based ECB said in its quarterly Bank
Lending Survey today. Banks tightened credit standards less for
home loans and at the same rate for companies as in the previous
quarter.  ECB President Mario Draghi pledged last month to keep
interest rates low for an extended period of time amid low
inflation, a subdued economic outlook and “weaker and weaker”
credit flows. Lending to companies and households in the euro
area has  contracted  for more than a year as the longest-ever
recession in the 17-nation region weighs on bank balance sheets
and investment demand.  The ECB survey was conducted from June 19 to July 4 and
included 132 banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
