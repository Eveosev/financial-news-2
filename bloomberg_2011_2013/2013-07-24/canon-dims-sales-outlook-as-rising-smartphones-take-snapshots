Canon Inc. (7751)  is finding it even harder
to sell cameras in a global market where smartphones already
command a 13-to-1 lead in shipments.  The world’s biggest camera maker cut its annual profit and
sales forecasts yesterday as it faces slowing demand for the
compact and high-end models with interchangeable lenses that
underpin its 983 billion-yen ($10 billion)  business . The  shares 
slumped the most in three months on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Worldwide shipments of cameras have  fallen  to a 10-year low
as consumers increasingly take pictures with phones from  Apple
Inc. (AAPL)  and  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  equipped with lenses capable of
high-quality snapshots. Canon said an economic slowdown in
 China , which it expects will become the biggest market, is also
curbing demand while Japanese rival  Nikon Corp. (7731)  looks for ways
to tap smartphone growth to counter the slump.  “The cannibalization effect on compact cameras by
smartphones has become quite serious,” said Toshiya Hari, a
Tokyo-based analyst for Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “Canon will
have to find a new growth driver. I can’t imagine the camera
market will grow much further in the coming decade.”  Shares of the Tokyo-based company  fell  5.4 percent to close
at 3,245 yen, the second-biggest percentage-loser on  Japan ’s
benchmark Nikkei 225 Stock Average. Nikon dropped 4.7 percent to
2,161 yen, while the stock index slid 1.1 percent.  Goldman Sachs cut its share price forecast for Canon to
3,270 yen from 3,400 yen, saying “the underlying situation
looks severe,” while Nomura Holdings Inc. reduced its target by
14 percent to 3,617 yen.  Smartphones Surge  Worldwide camera shipments  fell  29 percent to 434 billion
yen in the first five months of 2013, according to the Camera &
Imaging Products Association in  Tokyo .  For the year, shipments will probably fall 30 percent,
Masahiro Ono, an analyst at Morgan Stanley MUFG Securities Co.
in Tokyo, said a report July 16. Total shipments will probably
be 68.6 million units, down from 98.1 million last year, Ono
said.  Conversely, smartphone shipments are expected to rise about
32 percent to 928 million units, market-research firm TrendForce
said in a July 23 report.  Samsung, the world’s largest smartphone maker with about 30
percent of the market, released its flagship Galaxy S4 in April.
Apple, which had about 19 percent of sales, said July 23 it will
introduce new products starting in the fall.  Forecasts Cut  As handsets evolve, the level of detail offered for
pictures is increasing. Apple’s iPhone 5 has an 8-megapixel
camera, while the S4 that was released in April offers 13-megapixels.  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  this month unveiled its Lumia 1020 with a
41-megapixel camera.  Canon’s EOS-1D X, which  sells for $6,799  on the company’s
U.S. website, has an 18.1-megapixel sensor.  Canon said yesterday said net income will probably be 260
billion yen in 2013, cutting its April  projection  of 290 billion
yen by 10 percent.  The maker of PowerShot and EOS cameras cut its sales target
for 2013 compact models to 14 million from 14.5 million and its
forecast for single-lens reflex deliveries to 9 million from 9.2
million.  “We knew there was a slump in cameras but it’s worse than
our expectation,” said  Mitsushige Akino , chief fund manager at
Ichiyoshi Asset Management Co. in Tokyo. “The situation will be
difficult for Canon for a while.”  Weaker Yen  Canon cut its sales forecast to 3.85 trillion yen for this
year from an April  projection  of 3.98 trillion yen. Operating
profit, or sales minus the cost of goods sold and administrative
expenses, may be 16 percent less than previously expected at 380
billion yen, the company said.  “The market worries that there may be a negative impact on
SLR cameras from smartphone cameras,” said  Hisashi Moriyama , an
analyst at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in Tokyo. Canon’s operating
profit forecast “reaffirmed there’s a part that Canon can’t
make up with its own efforts in its camera business.”  Nikon, the world’s No. 2 camera maker, is trying to tap the
smartphone boom after warning of weaker-than-forecast earnings.
The company’s first-quarter results may be “a little short” of
its plan, President Makoto Kimura said this month.  Some of the impact on earnings by slowing camera sales gets
offset by a weaker yen, which boosts the repatriated value of
Japanese exporters’ overseas earnings. Canon makes about 80
percent of its annual revenue  outside Japan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
