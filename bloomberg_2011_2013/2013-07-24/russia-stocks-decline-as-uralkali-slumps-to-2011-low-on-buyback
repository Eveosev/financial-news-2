Russian equities tumbled, led by OAO
Uralkali, as the world’s largest potash producer by output
neared the end of a $1.6 billion share buyback.  The benchmark  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  retreated 0.3 percent to 1,413.67
by 12 p.m. in Moscow. Uralkali fell as much as 3.9 percent,
trading down 2.7 percent at 193.50 rubles, the third day of
declines. OAO Magnit,  Russia ’s biggest food retailer, slumped
2.4 percent to 8,055.10 rubles, while smaller rival OAO Dixy
Group jumped 1.6 percent to 492.83 rubles.  Uralkali approved a one-year $1.6 billion share buyback
program in November after the stock declined. The company has
bought about $1.3 billion of shares to date, according to a July
22 statement. Dixy climbed after first-half revenue rose 23
percent from a year earlier. Magnit surged 5.8 percent yesterday
and is the  best performer  on the Micex this year with a 67
percent advance, trading at 22 times estimated earnings,
compared with 18 times for Dixy.  “Uralkali continues its slump because of the upcoming end
to its buyback,” Vitaly Kupeev, an analyst at Allianz
Investments in Moscow, said by phone. “Investors are selling
Magnit and buying Dixy because it’s much cheaper and posted good
results.”  China ’s manufacturing contracted at a faster pace in July,
signaling a deepening slowdown in the world’s second-largest
economy, according to an initial purchasing managers index
compiled by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  Crude oil, Russia’s main export earner, retreated 0.2
percent to $107.06 a barrel in  New York . Russia receives about
50 percent of its budget revenue from oil and natural gas sales.
 Standard & Poor’s GSCI (SPGSCI)  Index of commodities was little changed
for the second day at 647.99. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
lost 0.2 percent to 1,377.74.  Mechel Surges  OAO  Mechel (MTLR) , Russia’s biggest coking coal producer, added
4.4 percent to 102.10 rubles, the strongest advance on the
Micex. The company said last month it plans to spend as much as
$100 million on a yearlong share buyback to curb further
declines in the stock which has plunged 50 percent this year.  The Micex climbed 1.7 percent last week on speculation the
U.S. Federal Reserve will keep stimulus in place. Russia’s
equities trade at the cheapest valuations based on estimated
earnings among 21 emerging economies tracked by Bloomberg.  While Bank Rossii kept its main rates unchanged on July 12,
it introduced a one-year floating-rate facility with a starting
cost of 5.75 percent, compared with its 7.5 percent fixed-rate
for similar-maturity loans. Russia’s economy grew 1.6 percent in
the first three months, spurring calls for easing.  Relative Strength  The volume of shares traded on the Micex was 19 percent
below the 30-day average, data compiled by Bloomberg show, while
10-day  price swings  retreated to 16.05. The 50-member Micex’s
4.3 percent decline in 2013 compares with a 3 percent increase
for  India ’s benchmark Sensex Index and  Brazil ’s  Ibovespa Index’s (IBOV) 
20 percent loss.  The 14-day  relative strength index  on the Micex subsided to
62 from 64 yesterday. The RSI measures how rapidly prices have
advanced or dropped during a specified time period. Readings
below 30 indicate a security may be poised to rise, while those
above 70 signal a potential drop.  Thirty six stocks, or 72 percent, were trading above their
 50-day moving average  on the Micex yesterday. One closed at a
 52-week low  and one at a 52-week high, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The Russian Volatility Index, which
measures expected swings in RTS futures, dropped 0.4 percent,
falling for a fourth day. The Bloomberg Russia-US Equity Index
of the most-traded Russian companies in the U.S. climbed 0.6
percent to 93.09 yesterday.  The Micex trades at 5.3 times its 12-month estimated
earnings, compared with a multiple of 10 for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
