German manufacturing unexpectedly
expanded in July and services growth accelerated, signaling that
the recovery in  Europe ’s largest economy is building momentum.  A manufacturing  index  based on a survey of  purchasing
managers  rose to 50.3 from 48.6 in June, London-based Markit
Economics said today. Economists in a Bloomberg survey predicted
49.2. A similar gauge for  services  rose to 52.5 from 50.4,
compared with the median estimate of economists of 50.7. A
reading of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and
contraction.  The euro rose against the dollar after the report was
published and was trading at $1.3250 as of 8:37 a.m. London
time, up 0.2 percent from yesterday.  The Ifo institute’s index of German business confidence
increased for a second month in June and unemployment
unexpectedly declined. Factory orders, industrial production and
exports slumped in May as overseas sales were curbed amid the
17-nation euro region’s struggle to emerge from recession and
slower growth in  China ,  Germany ’s third-biggest export
destination.  The Bundesbank said on July 22 that after a strong second
quarter, helped by a rebound in industry and construction, signs
of a slowdown in economic output are now appearing.  Separately today, an index of French manufacturing rose to
49.8 from 48.4, while a services gauge jumped to 48.3 from 47.2.
Both measures exceeded economists’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
