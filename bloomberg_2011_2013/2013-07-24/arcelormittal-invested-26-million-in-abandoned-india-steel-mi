ArcelorMittal (MT)  had invested a total
of $26 million in the Odisha steel mill in India it abandoned
last week, spokesman Ritesh Sinha said by e-mail.  The Luxembourg-based company scrapped the project seven
years after agreeing to the development because of delays in
land purchases and mine allocations, it said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
