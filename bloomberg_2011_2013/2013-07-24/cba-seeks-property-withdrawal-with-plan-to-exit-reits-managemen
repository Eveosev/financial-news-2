Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  is
seeking to exit its property management business by proposing
that its three listed property funds set up their own management
teams.  CFS Retail Property Trust (CFX)  and  Commonwealth Property Office
Fund (CPA) , now managed by CBA’s funds management division, and Kiwi
Income Property Trust in New Zealand have received a conditional
proposal from the bank to internalize their management, the
trusts said in separate regulatory filings. The bank is also
proposing that CFS Retail acquire the wholesale property funds
management and retail property and development business from
CBA, the trust said.  An exit by CBA would see the last major Australian bank
with a property arm distance itself from its real estate
business, after Macquarie Group Ltd. in 2010 sold the management
rights of its property trusts to  Charter Hall Group. (CHC)   Commonwealth Management Investments Ltd., the manager of
the two Australian trusts, has established a sub-commitee of
independent directors to consider the proposal, it said. It has
appointed UBS AG as financial adviser and Ashurst as legal
council, it said. The board of Kiwi Income Properties Ltd. will
consider the proposal for Kiwi Income Property Fund, the trust
said.  CFS Retail,  Australia ’s third-biggest retail property trust
by market capitalization at A$5.5 billion ($5.1 billion), was
2.1 percent higher at A$1.965 as of 10:25 a.m. in Sydney.
Commonwealth Property Office Fund, valued at A$2.6 billion, was
also 2.1 percent higher at A$1.11.  To contact the reporter on this story:
