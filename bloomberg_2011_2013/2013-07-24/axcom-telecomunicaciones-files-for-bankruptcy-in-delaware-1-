Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB, a
Mexico City-based carrier, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy court
protection in the U.S.  Maxcom listed $11.1 billion in assets and $402.3 million in
debt in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington,
Delaware. Fourteen of the company’s affiliates will be filing
Chapter 11 petitions, according to the filing.  Maxcom, which has struggled to compete with billionaire
 Carlos Slim ’s  America Movil (AMXL)  SAB, said on April 25 it was
considering filing for Chapter 11 after a takeover deal with
Ventura Capital Privado SA collapsed when the company failed to
persuade 80 percent of bondholders to accept its restructuring
proposal.  The company’s defaulted bonds surged to a 10-week high
earlier this month after it unveiled a second restructuring
proposal with Ventura Capital. The telephone company said June
18 it missed an $11 million bond payment as it held discussions
with Ventura and bondholders.  The case is In re Maxcom Telecomunicaciones SAB, 13-11839,
U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
