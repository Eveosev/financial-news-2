India ’s rupee snapped a two-day loss
and benchmark bonds plunged to the lowest level in more than a
year after the monetary authority took steps to further restrict
banks’ access to cash to arrest the currency’s slide.  The Reserve Bank of India capped the amount lenders can
borrow in daily repurchase auctions at 0.5 percent of their
deposits, it said in a statement yesterday. The move prompted
the overnight interbank call money rate to surge today to 9.25
percent, the highest since March 2012, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The RBI also raised the daily balance
requirement for lenders’ cash-reserve ratio to 99 percent from
70 percent effective July 27, while separately announcing an
auction of 60 billion rupees of cash-management bills tomorrow.  “Money-market rates have spiked and it’s anyone’s guess
how this will play out on growth and the markets,” said  Paresh Nayar , head of currency and money markets at the Indian unit of
 FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  in Mumbai. “Demand for dollars in the currency
market is intact” due to the current-account deficit, he said.  The rupee advanced 0.5 percent to 59.4950 per dollar as of
9:57 a.m. in Mumbai, according to prices from local banks
compiled by Bloomberg. The currency, which dropped to a record
61.2125 on July 8, has weakened 8.6 percent in the past three
months on concern the U.S. will pare stimulus that drove demand
for emerging-market assets.  The yield on the 7.16 percent bonds due May 2023 rose 25
basis points, or 0.25 percentage point, to 8.43 percent,
according to the central bank’s trading system. That’s the
highest for a benchmark 10-year note since May 2012.  Rupee Vulnerable  Global funds have cut holdings of Indian debt by $8.8
billion since May 22, when Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke first signaled the central bank may curb bond buying.
The outflows leave the rupee vulnerable to a current-account
shortfall that widened to an unprecedented 4.8 percent of gross
domestic product in the year ended March 31.  To limit the rupee’s drop, which threatens to stoke
inflation in a nation that imports 80 percent of its oil, the
RBI on July 15 raised two interest rates and moved to drain
money through bond sales. The central bank kept its main
repurchase rate unchanged at 7.25 percent as the economy grows
at the slowest pace in a decade.  Three-month onshore rupee forwards rose 0.2 percent to
60.92 per dollar, data compiled by Bloomberg show. Offshore non-deliverable contracts gained 0.4 percent to 60.73. Forwards are
agreements to buy or sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in dollars.  To contact the reporters on this story:
