Corn dropped to a 33-month low for a
second day as rain and warm weather boost prospects for a record
crop in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer and exporter.
Soybeans and wheat retreated.  Scattered precipitation is expected in the central part of
the Great Plains by July 29 and no hot weather in the next six
to 10 days, DTN said in a report today. Rain expected in parts
of  North Dakota ,  South Dakota  and  Minnesota  will “favor” corn,
soybeans and spring wheat, the forecaster said.  “We could not ask for a more ideal weather situation than
what we have,” Jacquie Voeks, a senior market advisor at
Stewart-Peterson Group in West Bend, Wisconsin, said in a
telephone interview.  Corn futures for December delivery tumbled 1.1 percent to
settle at $4.8025 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the  Chicago  Board of
Trade. The price earlier touched $4.795, the lowest for a most-active contract since Oct. 5, 2010.  “If the harvest was today, there are places in Minnesota
and Wisconsin that would harvest 30 to 40 bushels over the
five-year average,” Voeks said. Minnesota produced 167.2
bushels an acre during that period, and  Wisconsin  yielded
145.8, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.  Soybean futures for November delivery fell 0.3 percent to
$12.5675 a bushel on the CBOT, after touching $12.53, the lowest
since July 15.  Wheat futures for September delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$6.5325 a bushel in Chicago.  To contact the reporters on this story:
