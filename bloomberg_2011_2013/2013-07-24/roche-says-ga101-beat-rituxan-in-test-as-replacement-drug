Roche Holding AG (ROG) ’s experimental
leukemia drug GA101 beat its top-seller Rituxan in a trial that
may help position the new product as the older treatment’s heir.  Combined with chemotherapy, GA101 was better than Rituxan
at helping patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and who
hadn’t previously been treated, live longer without the cancer
getting worse, Basel, Switzerland-based Roche said in a
statement today. U.S. regulators granted GA101 priority review
for CLL patients this month, which means a decision on whether
the drug can be sold in that market is due by the end of 2013.  Details on how much better GA101 performed won’t be
publicly available until December, when the study’s results will
be submitted to the American Society of Hematology’s annual
meeting. GA101 is a pillar of Roche’s strategy for bolstering
its blood cancer business as Rituxan is expected to face
competition from cheaper biosimilar copies.  “These very strong results in CLL bode well for a
potential efficacy in other types of blood cancer,” Odile Rundquist, a Geneva-based analyst at Helvea AG, wrote in a
report today. Based on the results so far, Rundquist estimated
GA101’s annual sales will reach 1.15 billion Swiss francs ($1.23
billion).  Roche  rose  as much as 1.7 percent to 235.10 francs and was
trading up 1.3 percent at 11:34 a.m. in Zurich, heading toward
the stock’s first gain since July 12. The shares have risen 27
percent this year, valuing Roche at 202 billion francs.  The drugmaker is also comparing GA101 with Rituxan in
aggressive and indolent lymphoma patients,  Hal Barron , Roche’s
chief medical officer, said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
