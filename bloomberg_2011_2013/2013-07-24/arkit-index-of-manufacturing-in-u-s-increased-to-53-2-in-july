The Markit Economics  preliminary
index  of U.S. manufacturing increased to 53.2 in July from a
final reading of 51.9 a month earlier, the London-based group
said today.  The median  forecast  in a Bloomberg survey of 16 economists
called for a gain to 52.6. Estimates ranged from 51 to 53.8. A
reading greater than 50 for the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. Markit’s purchasers figure is based on
replies from 85 percent to 90 percent of those American
manufacturers who respond to a poll of the more than 600
companies.  The measure follows reports last week that showed
industrial production climbed in the U.S. in June, while
manufacturing in the  New York (EMPRGBCI)  and  Philadelphia (OUTFGAF)  regions expanded
more than forecast this month. The Markit gauge of U.S.
manufacturing debuted in May 2012, and the company surveys
purchasing managers in more than 30 countries and regions, which
also include Europe and China.  Manufacturing in the 17-nation euro area expanded in July
for the first time in two years, led by  Germany , Markit figures
showed today. The encouraging news from Europe contrasted with
China, where manufacturing weakened more than forecast, a
separate Markit report showed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
