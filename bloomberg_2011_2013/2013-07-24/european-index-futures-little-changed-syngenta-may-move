European  stocks  rose to an almost
eight-week high as data signaled  Germany  is leading a revival in
euro-area manufacturing and companies posted results that
exceeded estimates.  Volvo AB (VOLVB)  advanced the most in 10 months after the world’s
second-largest truckmaker reported second-quarter earnings that
beat forecasts. EasyJet climbed 3.7 percent after saying
quarterly sales rose 11 percent on higher capacity utilization
and revenue per seat.  Syngenta (SYNN)  AG fell 4 percent after posting
first-half profit and revenue that trailed forecasts.  The Stoxx Europe 600 Index added 0.6 percent to 301.1 in
London, the highest close since May 30. The benchmark pared
earlier gains of as much as 1 percent. The index has rebounded
9.2 percent from this year’s low on June 24 as central banks
around the world pledged to continue stimulus measures.  “I’ve been positively surprised by the earnings season so
far,” said Michael Woischneck, who helps oversee about $9.3
billion at Lampe Asset Management in Dusseldorf, Germany.
“Companies are holding up quite well and guidance from CEOs
seem to show they are confident with their road maps ahead. I’m
not saying I expect the next big boom in Europe, but there are
signs that the economy is not getting worse.”  National benchmark indexes climbed in all 18 western
European markets today, except  Greece . The U.K.’s FTSE 100 added
0.4 percent, while Germany’s DAX gained 0.8 percent and  France ’s
CAC 40 rose 1 percent.  Manufacturing Revival  Preliminary data today showed euro-area manufacturing is
expanding this month for the first time since July 2011. A
manufacturing index based on a survey of  purchasing managers 
increased to 50.1 from 48.8 in June, Markit Economics said.
Economists in a Bloomberg survey had predicted 49.1. A reading
of 50 is the dividing line between expansion and contraction.  In Germany,  manufacturing  unexpectedly expanded in July and
services  growth  accelerated.  A U.S. report showed sales of  new houses  in the world’s
largest economy rose more than forecast in June to the highest
level in five years. Purchases climbed 8.3 percent to an
annualized pace of 497,000 homes, the Commerce Department said
in  Washington . The median estimate of 77 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for a gain to 484,000.  Volvo gained 5 percent to 97.90 kronor. Second-quarter
earnings before interest and taxes of 3.26 billion kronor ($505
million) exceeded the 3.22 billion-kronor average analyst
estimate in a Bloomberg survey. Revenue increased to 72.8
billion kronor, compared with the 71.6 billion kronor average
estimate.  EasyJet Rallies  EasyJet advanced 3.7 percent to 1,385 pence.  Europe ’s
second-largest discount airline said third-quarter sales rose 11
percent and that full-year earnings should beat analyst
estimates as it adds customers on routes where network carriers
are withdrawing.  Ryanair Holdings Plc, which posts quarterly results next
week, rose 4.8 percent to 7.37 euros in Dublin. A  gauge  of
travel and leisure companies posted the best performance on the
Stoxx 600.  Edenred rallied 7.1 percent to 24.34 euros, its biggest
advance since August 2011. The provider of employee-benefit
vouchers set a target of 370 million euros ($490 million) to 390
million euros for current operating profit in 2013.  Syngenta Earnings  Syngenta, the biggest maker of crop chemicals, fell 4
percent to 371 Swiss francs, its largest decline since September
2011. Adjusted earnings of $15.92 a share in the first half
missed the average analyst projection for $17.15, as cold
weather across Germany and the U.S. hurt demand for its
fungicides.  Tod’s SpA (TOD) , an Italian maker of luxury shoes and handbags,
dropped 3.9 percent to 119.50 euros, its biggest retreat in
eight months. UBS AG cut its  rating  on the stock to sell from
neutral, saying it expects weak sales growth in the first half
of 2013 to pull down profit margins. UBS also said it doesn’t
expect a takeover bid for Tod’s as some investors have argued.
The company releases results on Aug. 7.  The number of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the Stoxx 600 companies was 14 percent lower than the average of
the past 30 days, data compiled by Bloomberg shows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
