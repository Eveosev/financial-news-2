Bank of America Corp.  will sell 20
branches to  Berkshire Hills Bancorp Inc. (BHLB) , Berkshire said today
in a statement. Terms weren’t disclosed.  The branches are in New York markets and have about $640
million in total deposits and $5 million in loans, according to
the statement. Berkshire’s New York branch count will more than
double to 37, the Pittsfield, Massachusetts-based lender said.  Separately,  Community Bank System Inc. (CBU)  of Syracuse, New
York, said it will buy eight Bank of America branches in
northeastern Pennsylvania, paying a premium of about 2.39
percent for about $369 million in deposits.  Bank of America is ranked second by assets among U.S.
lenders. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based firm has been
trimming branches and selling operations for the past three
years to simplify its structure and build its financial strength
after repaying a federal bailout in late 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
