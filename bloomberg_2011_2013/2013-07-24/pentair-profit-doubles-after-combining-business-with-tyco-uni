Pentair Ltd. (PNR) , a maker of water
filtration and pump systems, said second-quarter profit more
than doubled to $154.1 million from $72.7 million a year earlier
after merging in September with Tyco International Ltd.â€™s flow-control unit.  Revenue also doubled to $1.96 billion, buoyed by water and
fluid solutions sales to residential and commercial customers
and its valves business, the Schaffhausen, Switzerland-based
company with its main U.S. office in  Minneapolis  said yesterday
in a statement. The shares have climbed almost 45 percent over
the past year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
