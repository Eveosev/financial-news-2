Cenovus Energy Inc. (CVE) , the fourth-largest Canadian oil producer, said second-quarter profit fell
55 percent on higher currency losses and lower hedging gains.  Net income of C$179 million ($174 million), or 24 cents a
share, compared with C$397 million, or 52 cents, a year earlier,
the Calgary-based company said today in a statement. Excluding
one-time items, per-share profit missed the 49-cent average of
17 analysts’  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  The drop in net income was partially offset by a decline in
deferred tax expenses, the company said.  Cash flow  was lower as
the narrowing spread between U.S. benchmark  oil prices  and
Western Canada Select resulted in increased feedstock costs.  Higher heavy oil prices will boost the value of the
company’s output from its oil-sands operations to $53 a barrel
from $33 a barrel in the first quarter, said Greg Pardy, an
analyst at Royal Bank of Canada, in a July 18 note.  Cenovus co-owns a refinery in Borger, Texas, and another in
Roxana,  Illinois , with  Phillips 66. (PSX)  The facilities together can
process more than 450,000 barrels of oil a day, according to
Cenovus’s  website .  Total oil production rose 10 percent to more than 171,000
barrels a day in the quarter.  Cenovus fell 0.7 percent to C$32.25 yesterday in Toronto.
The stock, which is down 3.1 percent this year, has 18 buy and
six hold ratings from analysts.  Suncor Energy Inc., Imperial Oil Ltd. and Husky Energy Inc.
are the three largest Canadian oil producers by sales, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
