AFK Sistema (AFKS) , the Russian investment
group that exited oil producer OAO Russneft for about $1.2
billion this month, will use cash from the sale to increase
dividends, billionaire owner Vladimir Evtushenkov said.  “Dividends will definitely grow next year,” Evtushenkov
said in an interview in his Moscow office overlooking Red
Square. “Proceeds from Russneft will definitely be included in
the 2013 dividend mass and will boost the payout.”  With the sale of 49 percent in Russneft, Sistema is
starting to deliver on promises of greater returns to investors.
The proceeds from its divestment show Russneft, where
billionaire  Mikhail Gutseriev  and  Glencore Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  are
partners, gained in value since its purchase for less than $100
million in 2010, having profited from rising oil prices in the
subsequent two years.  Sistema, which also controls  Russia ’s largest mobile-phone
operator, made oil a focus for development in 2009, spending
$2.5 billion to take control of refining and production assets
combined into OAO Bashneft. After buying Russneft shares the
following year, it began talks on merging the two.  Sistema sold its stake in Russneft after Gutseriev, the oil
producer’s founder, and Glencore, its largest creditor and a
shareholder in some of its units, opposed a proposed merger with
Bashneft, Evtushenkov said.  ‘Losing Influence’  “Glencore was against combining with Bashneft, they wanted
to develop Russneft together with Mr. Gutseriev,” said
Evtushenkov, who is Sistema’s chairman. “In a combined company,
Glencore would have had only a small stake, losing influence
over developing company strategy, including oil exports.”  Charles Watenphul, a spokesman for Baar, Switzerland-based
Glencore, declined to comment.  Russneft lowered net debt to $5 billion by the end of last
year, according to a statement. The company in 2011 had agreed
with creditors Glencore and OAO Sberbank to cut rates on $6.2
billion of debt and extend maturities. Glencore is also a
shareholder in Russneft subsidiaries.  Sistema sold its stake in the oil producer to companies
controlled by Mikail Shishkhanov and Felix Dlin, according to a
regulatory filing. Both men have business ties to Gutseriev, and
Shishkhanov is his nephew. Sistema has a three-month option to
buy stakes in Russneft’s Urals-based production units in
addition to the agreement, the statement shows.  Output Boost  Sistema, based in Moscow, will continue to develop
Bashneft’s production, Evtushenkov said. The oil company, now
valued at $11.3 billion, has boosted  output  to 320,000 barrels a
day in June, an increase of 39 percent since March 2009, when it
agreed to boost its ownership to control.  The holding company may also offer Bashneft shares on the
market or to a strategic partner, according to the Sistema
chairman.  While saying there have been no talks on selling Bashneft
after Vedomosti reported last month that state-run  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) 
had been interested, Evtushenkov said he remains open to selling
the business.  “There is no such word as ‘no’ in business, all depends on
price,” he said. “When a businessman says it’s not for sale,
he is not a businessman anymore.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
