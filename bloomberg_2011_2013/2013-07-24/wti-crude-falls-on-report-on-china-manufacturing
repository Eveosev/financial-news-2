West Texas Intermediate crude fell
the most in more than a month as U.S. output surged to a 22-year
high last week and Chinese manufacturing contracted more than
economists estimated.  Futures slid 1.7 percent after the Energy Information
Administration said  crude production  rose 0.9 percent to 7.56
million barrels a day, the most since December 1990. Crude and
fuel supplies declined, the report showed. The HSBC Holdings Plc
and Markit Economics  China  manufacturing gauge came in at 47.7,
according to a preliminary survey of  purchasing managers .
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg forecast 48.2.  “There were good-sized supply draws but we still have a
surplus,” said  Tim Evans , an energy analyst at Citi Futures
Perspective in New York. “We aren’t going to see a deficit
anytime soon. The market has been paying a lot of attention to
China recently so the weak Chinese data is also relevant.”  WTI oil for September delivery slipped $1.84 to settle at
$105.39 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . It was the
biggest decline since June 21. The volume of all futures traded
was 1.4 below the 100-day average for the time of day at 3:29
p.m. Prices have advanced 9.1 percent this month and are up 15
percent this year.  Brent crude  for September settlement dropped $1.23, or 1.1
percent, to end the session at $107.19 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange. The volume of all futures
traded was 16 percent below the 100-day average. The European
benchmark grade settled at a $1.80 premium to WTI, up from $1.19
yesterday. Brent slid below the U.S. grade in intraday trading
on July 19 for the first time since August 2010.  Crude Supplies  U.S. crude production has surged as the combination of
horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, has
unlocked supplies trapped in shale formations in the central
part of the country.  Crude stockpiles decreased 29.9 million barrels in the four
weeks ended July 19, the largest four-week drop in data dating
to 1982, according to the EIA, the Energy Department’s
statistical unit. Inventories surged to 397.6 million on May 24,
the most since 1931.  Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery point for
WTI, dropped 2.06 million barrels to 44 million last week, the
report showed. Supplies reached a record 51.9 million barrels in
the week ended Jan. 11.  Refineries operated  at 92.3 percent of capacity, down 0.5
percentage point from the prior week. Utilization rates usually
peak during the summer months when U.S. gasoline demand rises.  Fuel Inventories  Gasoline stockpiles slid 1.39 million barrels to 222.7
million. Inventories of  distillate fuel , a category that
includes heating oil and diesel, fell 1.23 million barrels to
126.5 million.  Total  petroleum consumption  rose 1.1 percent to 19.7
million barrels a day on average over the past four weeks, the
most since January 2011.  WTI climbed to $109.32 on July 19, the highest intraday
level since March 2012, on signs the  U.S. economy  is rebounding
and on falling crude inventories.  “These numbers signal that demand is pretty good and
portend that we will see rosier economic growth in the months
ahead,” said  Chip Hodge , who oversees a $9 billion natural-resource bond portfolio as senior managing director at Manulife
Asset Management in  Boston . “The market has had a hell of a run
and it would take incredibly bullish numbers to push the market
to new highs.”  Chinese Manufacturing  If the Chinese manufacturing number is confirmed in the
final report Aug. 1, it would be the lowest level in 11 months.
Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  China was responsible for 12 percent of global oil
consumption and 22 percent of total energy use in 2012,
according to  BP Plc (BP/) ’s Statistical Review of World Energy. The
U.S. accounted for 20 percent of oil demand and 18 percent of
total energy use last year.  “The market is sputtering after reaching 16-month highs,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “Tighter fundamentals, signs of
further global economic growth and increasing geopolitical
tensions will be needed if oil is going to reach new highs.”  Dollar Strength  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.5 percent and the
 Dow Jones Industrial Average  fell 0.4 percent. The Bloomberg
U.S. Dollar Index, which tracks the currency against 10 others,
was up 0.5 percent at 1,030.90 at 3:29 p.m. A stronger U.S.
currency curbs the appeal of commodities as an investment. The
 Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index (SPGSCI)  of 24 raw materials slipped 1
percent, led by declines in coffee and WTI crude.  Implied volatility for at-the-money WTI options expiring in
September was 22.2 percent, up from 21.4 percent yesterday, data
compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Electronic trading volume on the Nymex was 546,110
contracts as of 3:29 p.m. It totaled 559,312 contracts
yesterday, 16 percent above the three-month average. Open
interest was 1.87 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
