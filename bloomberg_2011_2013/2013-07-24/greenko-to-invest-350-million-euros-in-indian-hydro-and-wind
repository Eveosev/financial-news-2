Greenko Group Plc (GKO) , an Indian clean-energy developer, plans to invest 350 million euros ($463
million) this fiscal year in onshore wind and hydropower plants
in  India  as it targets 1,000 megawatts of capacity by 2015.  The company, which has 806 megawatts of projects operating
or under construction, wants to bring online 250 megawatts of
new wind power capacity this year,  Mark Thompson , director of
corporate finance for Hyderabad-based Greenko, said by phone. It
expects to invest about 350 million euros this year and
“roughly” the same next year.  “We are at this wonderful stage where wind and hydropower
are some of the cheapest sources of energy generation in India
and we can still make attractive returns,” Thompson said.
“It’s a fantastic market and a huge opportunity.” The company
plans to both build and acquire hydropower assets.  Greenko operates about 309 megawatts of renewable energy
projects, including 41 megawatts of biomass. It has 446
megawatts under construction and expects to complete more than
200 megawatts before March 31. It said in December it sees
annual sales of 330 million euros by building and buying 1,000
megawatts of clean energy by 2015.  The company today reported revenue of 38.3 million euros
for the year ended March 31 compared with 36.9 million euros a
year earlier. It invested 219.9 million euros.  India, the world’s third-largest market for  wind turbines ,
had 18,552 megawatts of installed wind capacity as of January
2013, according to the Global Wind Energy Association. At the
end of last year renewable energy accounted for about 6 percent
of its electricity generation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
