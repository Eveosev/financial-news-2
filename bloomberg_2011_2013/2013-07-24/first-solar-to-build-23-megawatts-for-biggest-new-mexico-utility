First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s
largest builder of solar farms, agreed to construct three power
plants for New Mexico’s biggest utility.  The three plants under development for  PNM Resources Inc. (PNM) ’s
Public Service Co. of New Mexico will have a total of 23
megawatts of capacity, the Tempe, Arizona-based solar company
said today in a statement. The projects need state regulatory
approval and First Solar expects to complete them next year.  Once done, First Solar will have built 67 megawatts of
photovoltaic systems for the New Mexico utility.  To contact the reporter on this story:
