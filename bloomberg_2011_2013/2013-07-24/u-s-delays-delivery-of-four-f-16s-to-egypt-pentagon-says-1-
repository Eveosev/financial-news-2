The U.S. is delaying the planned
delivery of four F-16 fighter jets to Egypt because of the
“fluid situation” in that country after the military’s ouster
of former President Mohamed Mursi, a Pentagon spokesman said.  “Given the overall situation in Egypt right now, we
thought it prudent to make this decision,” Defense Department
spokesman  George Little  told reporters today at the Pentagon.  The jets are part of a scheduled delivery of 20 F-16s to
Egypt this year as part of the $1.3 billion in annual U.S.
military aid.  Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel spoke by telephone today with
Egyptian Defense Minister Abdelfatah al-Seesi to notify him of
the delay and to discuss al-Seesi’s call for a mass rally in
support of the military, Little said.  The Obama administration is reviewing whether Mursi’s
ouster requires suspending U.S. aid. A U.S. law requires denying
assistance to a country “whose duly elected head of government
is deposed by a military coup d’etat.”  State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters today
that the delayed F-16 delivery represents a “very specific
decision made at this specific time about this specific case”
and said it doesn’t reflect any broader determination about
further U.S. assistance.  “Given the current situation in  Egypt , we do not believe
it is appropriate to move forward with the delivery of F-16s at
this time,” she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
