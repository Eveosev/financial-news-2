MTU Aero Engines Holding AG (MTX)  said it
will fail to meet its 10 percent growth target because of
weaker spare parts sales at the German aircraft engine maker.
The shares fell as much as 10 percent, the most since 2008.  Adjusted net profit for the year will probably rise about
0.7 percent to 235 million euros ($311 million) from 233.4
million euros in 2012, the Munich-based engine maker said in a
statement today. The previous forecast was for profit to advance
as much as 12 percent. The average estimate of 19 analysts
compiled by Bloomberg was for full-year profit of 246.6 million
euros.  “We knew the second quarter wasn’t going to be stellar,
but the profit warning is a clear negative surprise,” said
Sebastian Hein, an analyst at Bankhaus Lampe in Dusseldorf,
 Germany . “The crucial question now is when will the spare parts
business come back? Or is someone else filling those orders?”  MTU fell 8.7 percent at 9:08 a.m. in  Frankfurt , the biggest
intraday decline since October 2008, valuing the manufacturer at
3.52 billion euros.  MTU has been investing in new aircraft engine programs,
including the geared turbofan  Pratt & Whitney  is developing for
planes such as the Airbus SAS A320neo and  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) 
CSeries, with outlays hampering profitability before more than
3,500 orders are delivered. Engine spare parts sales, which
could have been an earnings bridge, have been slowed as carriers
look to control cost and defer some repairs.  Behle Leaves  Adjusted earnings before interest and taxes will be around
375 million euros compared to 374.3 million euros last year, the
company said. Revenue should advance about 10 percent to 3.7
billion euros, it said. The previous forecast was for sales to
rise 10 percent to 12 percent.  “The spare parts business is unable to fully
counterbalance, because sales have been lower than expected in
certain programs,” said Chief Executive Officer Egon Behle. He
will leave the company at the end of this year and be replaced
by Chief Financial Officer Reiner Winkler.  Spare parts sales for its PW2000 engine, and turbines
powering the Boeing Co. 757 airliner and C-17 military airlifter
declined, even as activities for V2500 engines powering some
current A320s advanced, MTU said.  Profitability was also affected by non-aerospace gas
turbine activities which have been “stagnant” with low energy
prices slowing investment, MTU said.  Revenue in the first half advanced 19 percent to 1.85
billion euros, driven largely by sales of new commercial
engines, MTU said. The company has set a goal of 6 billion euros
in sales in 2020.  Adjusted net profit for the first-half fell 4.2 percent to
105.1 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
