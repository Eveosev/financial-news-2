Ethanol inventories in the U.S.
increased a third week to the highest level since April 19, an
Energy Information Administration report showed today.  Stockpiles jumped 4.1 percent to 17.3 million barrels,
extending the longest streak of gains since December, data from
the Energy Departmentâ€™s research unit showed. Output sank 2.6
percent to 853,000 barrels a day, the lowest level since May 3
and 7.2 percent higher than a year earlier.  Imports of the fuel decreased 18 percent to 41,000 barrels
a day from the previous week. Ethanol-blended gasoline made up
92 percent of the total U.S. gasoline pool, little changed from
a week earlier.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 2.6 cents, or
1.1 percent, to $2.353 a gallon at 10:49 a.m.  New York  time on
the Chicago Board of Trade. Prices have gained 7.5 percent this
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
