The U.S. Treasury Department
announced sanctions against five members of the Italian Camorra
and two businesses the government said are linked to people
acting on behalf of a member of the Brothers Circle crime
network.  The members of the Naples-based Camorra crime syndicate
designated by the Treasury include Marco Di Lauro and fugitive
Mario Riccio, the department said in a statement today.  The Camorra and the Brothers Circle, which operates in
Central Asia, Russia,  Europe  and the  Middle East , have been
labeled transnational criminal organizations by the Obama
administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
