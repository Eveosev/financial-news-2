Drummond Co.’s  Colombia  mine workers
halted coal production today in the first day of striking over a
wage dispute, the Sintramienergetica union said.  “No one is working,” union negotiator Cesar Flores said
in a phone interview from the company’s Pribbenow mine in
northern Colombia. “We are waiting for a better offer from the
company.”  Drummond offered a 4.75 percent pay increase to workers in
the first year. A strike would cost the government between 2 and
3 billion pesos ($1.1 million to $1.6 million) a day in lost
royalties, according to Mining Ministry estimates, and could act
as a drag on the government’s attempt to reverse a slowdown in
growth. Coal is Colombia’s biggest export after oil.  The company didn’t immediately reply to an e-mail seeking
comment today. Workers rejected the latest offer because “it’s
not enough,” Union official Alberto Solano said yesterday.
“They need to address education and health benefits.”  In 2012 Drummond produced 26 million metric tons of coal,
according to the National Mining Agency, making it the second-largest producer after the Cerrejon mine, owned by  BHP Billiton
Plc (BLT) ,  Xstrata Plc (GLEN)  and  Anglo American Plc. (AAL)   Wage talks between the union, company and Colombia’s Labor
ministry failed yesterday, after the union postponed a strike
from July 22. The union represents about 3,000 of Drummond’s
5,000 direct employees, with non-affiliated and contract workers
also downing tools, Flores said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
