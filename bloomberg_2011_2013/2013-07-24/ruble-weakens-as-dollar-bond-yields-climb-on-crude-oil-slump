The ruble weakened as crude oil,
 Russia ’s main export earner, sank and yields on the nation’s
dollar bonds rose.  The ruble depreciated 0.2 percent versus the dollar to
32.38 by 6 p.m. in Moscow. The currency slid 0.2 percent to
37.0823 against the dollar-euro basket and by the same versus
the euro to 42.8295. The yield on Russia’s dollar bond maturing
in March 2030 rose 14 basis points, or 0.14 percentage point, to
3.93 percent.  Oil fell as much as 0.9 percent to $106.32 per barrel in
New York today. The oil and natural-gas industries contribute
about 50 percent of Russia’s budget revenue.  China ’s
manufacturing contracted at a faster pace in July, signaling a
deepening slowdown in the world’s second-largest economy,
according to an initial purchasing managers index compiled by
HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics.  “Investors are living in fear of the oil price drop and
are expecting the ruble to weaken further as we near the end of
the month,” Artem Roschin, a foreign-exchange trader at Aljba
Alliance bank, said by phone from Moscow.  Russia sold all 10 billion rubles ($309 million) of
government ruble bonds due in 2016 at a 6.21 percent average
yield and 7.49 billion rubles of a planned 10 billion rubles of
2023 notes at a 7.19 percent yield.  The ruble rallied last week as investors speculated that
the Federal Reserve will keep stimulus measures in place,
boosting appetite for riskier, emerging-market assets. Fed
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke told lawmakers last week that the
central bank’s $85 billion of monthly bond purchases “could be
reduced more quickly or expanded” depending on the pace of
recovery in the U.S.  JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s Emerging Currencies Index dropped
0.2 percent to 91.374.  To contact the reporter on this story:
