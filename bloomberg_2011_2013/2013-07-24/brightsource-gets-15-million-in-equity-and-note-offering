BrightSource Energy Inc. (BRSE) , the U.S.
solar-thermal developer whose chief executive officer stepped
down last month, raised $15 million in an equity and convertible
promissory note offering with 44 unidentified investors.  It’s seeking to raise $35 million, according to a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission today. Jared
Blanton, a BrightSource spokesman, didn’t immediately reply to
phone and e-mail messages seeking comment.  The company, based in Oakland, California, is  backed  by
investors including venture-capital company VantagePoint Capital
Partners, Morgan Stanley and Alstom SA, Europe’s second largest
power-equipment company.  BrightSource CEO John Woolard announced his departure and a
“transition to a new CEO” on the company’s  blog  June 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
