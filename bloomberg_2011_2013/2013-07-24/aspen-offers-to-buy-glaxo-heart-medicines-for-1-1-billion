Aspen Pharmacare Holdings Ltd. (APN) 
offered  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  about 700 million pounds ($1.1
billion) for branded heart medicines Arixtra and Fraxiparine and
a related manufacturing site.  The price includes about 100 million pounds for inventory
and talks haven’t finished, Johannesburg-based Aspen said in a
statement today. Glaxo said June 18 it got a bid from Aspen for
the treatments.  Arixtra and Fraxiparine are part of a portfolio of more
than 50 older products that Glaxo has carved out into a separate
unit. The two drugs generated about 420 million pounds in global
revenue in 2012 compared with 510 million pounds the previous
year, Simon Steel, a spokesman for London-based Glaxo, said by
phone June 18. The sale would exclude rights in  China , India and
 Pakistan .  Aspen shares rose 2 percent to close at 219.60 rand in
Johannesburg, the biggest gain in a week. Glaxo closed 0.5
percent higher at 1,681 pence in London.  The U.K.’s biggest pharmaceutical company, based in
Brentford, owns a 19 percent stake in Aspen, a maker and
distributor of generic medicines. Aspen agreed to buy
pharmaceutical and over-the-counter brands from Glaxo in two
separate transactions last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
