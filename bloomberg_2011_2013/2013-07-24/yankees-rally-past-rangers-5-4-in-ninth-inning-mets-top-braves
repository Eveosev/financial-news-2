The New York Yankees scored two runs
off All-Star closer Joe Nathan in the ninth inning to secure a
5-4 win over the  Texas  Rangers.  A triple by  Eduardo Nunez  drove in Vernon Wells to tie the
game 4-4 and Brent Lillibridge’s run-scoring single secured the
win at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington, Texas.  The Yankees are fourth in Major League Baseball’s American
League East, seven games behind the division-leading Boston Red
Sox, who defeated the second-place Tampa Bay Rays 6-2 last night.  The Yankees (53-47) took a 3-0 lead last night. Austin Romine had a run-scoring double and Ichiro Suzuki added an
infield single in the third inning before Lillibridge drove in
Wells in the fourth.  The Rangers (55-45) then scored four runs in the sixth
inning to take the lead. Adrian Beltre’s double and a single by
Elvis Andrus contributed a run apiece before Mitch Moreland hit
a two run-homer.  Joba Chamberlain (2-0) pitched a perfect eighth inning to
get the win and Mariano Rivera earned his 32nd save, striking
out two in the ninth for the Yankees. Nathan (1-1) took the loss
for the Rangers (55-45).  At Citi Field in New York, Ike Davis hit a run-scoring
double to break a 1-1 tie and kick off a three-run sixth inning
as the Mets beat the Atlanta Braves 4-1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
