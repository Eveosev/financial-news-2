U.K. energy regulator Ofgem is
studying a proposal by a  SSE Plc (SSE)  unit to invest 205 million
pounds ($315 million) upgrading power transmission links in
 Scotland  to accommodate more renewable energy plants.  The funding will enable SHE Transmission Plc to build two
subsea cables that reinforce the electricity link between the
Kintyre peninsula in western Scotland and the rest of the
region’s transmission system, Ofgem said today in a statement.  The proposal from the British utility supports a government
effort to add renewable energy generation shoring up power
supplies while curbing pollution. The projects, often wind farms
or hydroplants in remote places, require upgraded transmission
infrastructure to bring their power to consumers.  The network upgrades will deliver about 260 megawatts of
extra transmission capacity when completed in 2016, according to
documents on Ofgem’s website. The plan will also upgrade
existing overhead lines between Crossaig and Carradale and build
a new substation at Crossaig, according to Ofgem.  Ofgem started a consultation on the proposal today, with a
funding decision expected in autumn. The funding would be
recovered from customers on their bills. The consultation is
part of Ofgem’s strategic wider works program for major
transmission projects.  To contact the reporter on this story:
