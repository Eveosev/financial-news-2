Home Afrika Ltd., the only real-estate developer listed on  Kenya ’s bourse, declined for a fourth
day on speculation that its initial public offering price was
valued too high relative to the market’s all-share index.  The company’s shares, which ended the first day of trading
on July 15 at 25 shillings, plunged 8.4 percent to 19 shillings
by the close today in the capital, Nairobi. About 15,200 shares
were traded, or 68 percent of the average daily volume in the
eight trading days since listing, according to Bloomberg
calculations.  “Home Afrika is currently overvalued,” Davis Mika, an
analyst at Nairobi-based Contrarian Investing Kenya Ltd., said
in an e-mailed note to clients. The company trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 54.8, he said. That compares the main
 index ’s 14.3. The stock’s “fair value” is 12.4 shillings, Mika
said.  Home Afrika’s sales in the 12 months to December may rise
19 percent to 1 billion shillings ($11 million) because of sales
of plots and houses, while net income may increase as much as 25
percent to 210 million shillings amid lower finance costs, he
said.  The listing “was not an avenue to raise money but for the
existing shareholders to discover the value of the company,”
Home Afrika Chief Executive Officer Gerald Chege said in a phone
interview. “Revenue in real estate is only recognized after a
transaction has been completed.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
