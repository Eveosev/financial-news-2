Macquarie Group Ltd. (MQG) ,  Australia ’s
largest investment bank, continues to expect higher net income
this fiscal year and raised its earnings forecast for the
group’s funds management unit.  Higher funds management fees and a weaker Australian dollar
will boost earnings while the group’s fixed income, currencies
and commodities unit will be broadly in line with the previous
year, the Sydney-based group said in a statement ahead of its
annual shareholders meeting. Macquarie in May posted profit for
the 12 months ended March 31 of A$851 million ($779 million).  Macquarie is gaining from a 12 percent decline in the
Australian dollar since March 31. A 10 percent fall in the
Australian currency would add about 6 percent to the group’s
annual net income, Chief Executive Officer  Nicholas Moore  said
in today’s statement.  “The broad underlying drivers are pointing to the early
stages of an upward trend for Macquarie,”  Angus Gluskie , chief
investment officer at White Funds Management Pty Ltd., said
before the announcement. “An increase in revenue in a
potentially lower-cost environment will give profits a boost.”
White Funds owns shares in the bank.  Macquarie didn’t alter its full year forecasts for other
operating groups.  To contact the reporter on this story:
