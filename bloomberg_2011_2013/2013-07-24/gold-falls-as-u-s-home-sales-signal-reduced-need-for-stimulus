Gold fell for a second straight day
as sales of new U.S. homes in June rose to a five-year high,
adding to signs of improved economic growth that may prompt the
 Federal Reserve  to slow financial stimulus measures.  Purchases (NHSLTOT)  climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized pace of
497,000 homes, the highest since May 2008, the Commerce
Department said today. Gold slid 20 percent this year through
yesterday, wiping $56.5 billion from the value of gold  exchange-traded product holdings , after some investors lost faith in the
metal as a store of value and amid concern that the Fed will
ease up on bond-buying intended to spur growth.  “Every new data becomes a point of speculation for the
timing of the stimulus tapering,” David Lee, a vice president
at Heraeus Precious Metals Management in  New York , said in a
telephone interview. “The market wants some clarity from the
Fed.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$1,333.10 an ounce at 11:10 a.m. on the Comex in New York.
Earlier, prices rose as much as 0.9 percent.  ETP holdings backed by the precious metal fell 2.8 metric
tons to 1,971.7 tons yesterday, the lowest since May 2010, data
compiled by Bloomberg show. The Fed currently buys $85 billion
of debt each month.  Bullion futures are up 9.1 percent in July, heading for the
biggest monthly gain since January 2012, after Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  said it’s too early to decide whether to begin
scaling back  bond purchases  in September.  Silver futures for September delivery fell 0.2 percent to
$20.205 an ounce in New York, heading for a second straight
drop.  To contact the reporter on this story:
