Cia de Saneamento Basico do Estado
de Sao Paulo ,  Brazil ’s biggest water provider, has awarded 1.68
billion reais ($750 million) in infrastructure contracts to
builders Camargo Correa SA and Andrade Gutierrez SA.  The Sao Lourenco Water Producing System will be developed
under a private-public partnership to supply water to
municipalities surrounding Sao Paulo, according to an official
for Sabesp, as the utility is known, who asked not to be
identified by name because of company policy. A contract will be
formally signed in September, he said today by phone.  The project will deliver 4,700 liters (1,240 gallons) of
water a second to cities when operational by 2017, Sabesp Chief
Executive Officer Dilma Pena said last November when announcing
the plans. Sabesp said it includes a water-treatment plant in
Vargem Grande Paulista and 83 kilometers (52 miles) of pipeline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
