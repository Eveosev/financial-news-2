New York  Jets wide receiver  Santonio Holmes  will be held out of practice when it begins in two days
as he recovers from a pair of offseason surgeries to fix a torn
ligament in his left foot.  Holmes, 29, has been placed on the preseason physically
unable to perform list, the National Football League team said
today on its Twitter account, meaning he may participate in team
meetings, but cannot practice. Jets training camp for all
players begins tomorrow in Cortland, New York, with the first
practice set for July 26.  Holmes missed the final 12 games of the 2012 season after
being diagnosed with an injury in the arch of his left foot. He
had surgeries in October and February, according to the New York
Post.  NFL teams can place players on the preseason physically
unable to perform list, or PUP list, if they are recovering from
a football-related injury that prevents them from practicing.
The preseason PUP list has no bearing on Holmesâ€™s ability to
start the regular season, as players can be removed at any time
during training camp.  A first-round draft pick out of  Ohio State University ,
Holmes has 123 receptions for 1,672 yards and 15 touchdowns in
three seasons with the Jets. He was named the Super Bowl Most
Valuable Player following the 2008 season when he was a member
of the Pittsburgh Steelers.  -- Editor: Michael Sillup  To contact the reporters on this story:
