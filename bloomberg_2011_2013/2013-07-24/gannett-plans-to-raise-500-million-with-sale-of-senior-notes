Gannett Co. (GCI) , the publisher that
agreed to buy Belo Corp. for about $1.5 billion last month,
plans to sell $500 million of senior notes to refinance debt.  The owner of USA Today intends to issue the seven-year
securities to repay borrowings from its revolving credit
facilities, with remaining proceeds potentially used to repay
other obligations, McLean, Virginia-based Gannett said today in
a statement distributed by PR Newswire. The company’s unsecured
debt is  rated  Ba1 at Moody’s Investors Service.  The new bonds would be Gannett’s longest-maturing
obligations, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Its $250
million of 7.125 percent notes due September 2018 traded at
107.38 cents on the dollar on July 15 to yield 5.45 percent,
according to Trace, the bond-price reporting system of the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Gannett is selling debentures after reporting a drop of
less than 1 percent in second-quarter sales as declining print
advertising held back growth at the company, which is
increasingly focused on the television industry. The Belo
purchase will almost double the TV stations it owns to 43.  To contact the reporter on this story:
