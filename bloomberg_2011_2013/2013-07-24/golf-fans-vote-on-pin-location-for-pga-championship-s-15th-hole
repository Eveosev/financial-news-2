Golf fans will pick the pin location
for the final par-3 at next month’s  PGA Championship  in a first
for the 95-year-old tournament.  Fans can choose between four options for the  181-yard 15th
hole  at Oak Hill Country Club in Rochester,  New York , which will
host the last major tournament of the year Aug. 8-11.  “The chance for golf fans to interact with the PGA
Championship and play a role in shaping the outcome of the final
round fascinates me,” five-time PGA champion  Jack Nicklaus  said
in a statement on the tournament organizer’s website.  Fans can get a visual of each choice and hear Nicklaus
explaining how each location will affect a golfer’s strategy.  “It’s a green that does have plentiful locations because
there’s water all the way down the length of the hole and three
bunkers,” said Kerry Haigh, the chief championships officer for
the PGA of America. “There isn’t an easy one. It’s difficult.
And it’s sheltered by a tree on the left, so the wind will
influence the shot.”  Entrants will also have an opportunity to win a behind-the-scenes experience for two during the 2014 PGA Championship at
Valhalla Golf Club in Louisville,  Kentucky , a Nicklaus-designed
course.  Voting at  http://www.pga.com/pickthehole  ends Aug. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
