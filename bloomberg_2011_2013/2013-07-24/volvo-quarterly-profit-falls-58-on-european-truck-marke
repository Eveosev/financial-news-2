Volvo AB (VOLVB) , the world’s second-largest
truckmaker, posted second-quarter earnings and sales that beat
analyst estimates as new models helped mitigate the effects of a
recession in  Europe  and currency shifts.  Earnings before interest and taxes of 3.26 billion kronor
($505 million) at Gothenburg, Sweden-based Volvo said exceeded
the 3.22 billion-krona average of nine analyst estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. Revenue amounted to 72.8 billion kronor,
compared with the 71.6 billion-krona average estimate.  Volvo rolled out new versions of its FH model line starting
in 2012 in a bid to counter economic contractions across Europe
that pushed five-month industrywide deliveries down 13 percent.
The manufacturer’s second-quarter worldwide truck orders rose 16
percent, including a 13 percent boost in its home region, Volvo
said today in a statement.  “The results were slightly better than I expected, as
pricing held up surprisingly well, considering the poor market
conditions,” Hans-Peter Wodniok, a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Fairesearch GmbH & Co said by phone. Wodniok said he’ll stick to
his sell  recommendation  for Volvo stock, though plans to lift
earnings estimates.  Stock Rises  Volvo rose as much as 3.5 percent to 96.55 kronor, the
biggest  intraday gain  since April 25, and was trading up 3
percent at 9:42 a.m. in  Stockholm . The stock has increased 8.2
percent this year, valuing the manufacturer at 204.4 billion
kronor. That compares with a 1.1 percent share decline in 2013
at Soedertaelje, Sweden-based competitor  Scania AB (SCVB)  and a 27
percent jump for  Daimler AG (DAI) , the luxury-car producer that’s also
the world’s largest maker of heavy trucks.  Ebit at Volvo in the quarter dropped 58 percent, reduced by
1.21 billion kronor because of exchange-rate moves, the company
said. Revenue fell 12 percent while deliveries declined 4.3
percent to 51,984 vehicles. Orders rose to 56,349 trucks.  Sales-contract “momentum” continued this quarter, and the
company has a “healthy” backlog, prompting Volvo to consider
increasing its production rate in Europe, Chief Executive
Officer Olof Persson said today at a Stockholm press conference.  The Swedish company has an emerging competitor in
 Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Europe’s biggest carmaker, which controls Scania
and Munich-based  MAN SE (MAN)  and is working to have the truck units
cooperate more closely. Scania said on July 19 that it will
increase production after quarterly orders rose.  Daimler Trucks  Daimler, whose commercial-vehicle brands include Mercedes-Benz and Freightliner, said today that its truck division’s
second-quarter deliveries rose 1 percent to 123,763 vehicles.
Ebit at the unit fell 17 percent to 434 million euros ($573
million) as sales declined 2 percent to 7.97 billion euros, the
Stuttgart, Germany-based manufacturer said.  Volvo’s new models this year will include four trucks in
the FH line, while the Renault brand presented a new range of
transport and construction vehicles in June, the Swedish company
said.  The company, which also owns the Mack nameplate in the
U.S., reiterated forecasts that industrywide North American
truck deliveries this year will about match the 250,000 vehicles
sold in 2012, with the European market probably increasing 4
percent to 230,000 trucks and Brazilian demand totaling 105,000
trucks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
