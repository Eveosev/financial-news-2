Rubber snapped a five-day winning
run after a private survey showed that  China ’s manufacturing
contracting at a faster-than-estimated pace this month,
increasing concern that demand may slow in the largest user.  Rubber for delivery in December dropped as much as 0.7
percent to 254.4 yen a kilogram ($2,553 a metric ton) on the
 Tokyo  Commodity Exchange and traded at 255 yen at 11:05 a.m.
local time. Earlier, the price rose to 259.3 yen, the highest
intraday price since July 19.  China’s manufacturing weakened further in July, signaling
that the worst of the slowdown has yet to be reached, according
to the survey of purchasing managers from HSBC Holdings Plc and
Markit Economics. The preliminary reading of 47.7 compares with
the 48.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of 19 economists
and 48.2 in June. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  The lower-than-expected PMI data “prompted investors to
sell rubber,” said Naohiro Niimura, a partner at research
company Market Risk Advisory Co. in Tokyo. The commodity dropped
in tandem with weaker equity markets, Niimura said.  Rubber for January delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent to
18,300 ($2,983) a metric ton on the Shanghai Futures Exchange,
and traded at 18,345  yuan . Earlier, the price gained 0.7 percent
to reach 18,515 yuan.  Thai rubber free-on-board gained 0.6 percent to 79.35 baht
($2.57) a kilogram on July 19, according to Rubber Research
Institute of  Thailand . Thai financial and commodity markets were
closed July 22-23 for a holiday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
