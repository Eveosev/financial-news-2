President  Barack Obama  is shuffling
his National Economic Council as he replaces aides who have
either left the administration or been promoted.  Byron Auguste, a director at McKinsey & Co. who runs their
social-sector practice in Washington, will become a deputy
director of the NEC, White House press secretary  Jay Carney 
said.  John Friedman, a professor at Harvard’s Kennedy’s School of
Government, will become a part of the council as a special
assistant to the president for economic policy. He will join
Seth Wheeler, a housing specialist who is already working as a
senior policy adviser at the NEC.  Sameera Fazili, a former policy analyst at the Treasury
Department, has also joined the NEC and has been working on the
Detroit bankruptcy issue.  The NEC coordinates domestic and international economic
advice and policy for the administration. The full council draws
from executive branch agencies and departments.  The personnel moves were reported earlier by the Wall
Street Journal. Carney was speaking to reporters aboard Air
Force One as Obama traveled to Knox College in Galesburg,
Illinois, for an economic address.  --. Editors: Joe Sobczyk, Robin Meszoly  To contact the reporters on this story:
