U.K.  10-year (GUKG10)  government bonds fell
with German bunds for a second day as gauges of British and
euro-area manufacturing rose, damping demand for the safest
fixed-income assets.  Benchmark 10-year gilt yields climbed to a two-week high
after a Confederation of British Industry gauge of U.K. factory
orders reached the highest level this year. Gilts slid before a
report tomorrow that economists said will show growth in  gross
domestic product  accelerated in the second quarter. An index
based on surveys of purchasing managers in the euro area showed
manufacturing output unexpectedly expanded in July. The pound
snapped a six-day advance versus the dollar.  “Strong PMIs in  Europe  are weighing on bunds and driving
the general move in core fixed-income yields higher,” said
Simon Peck, a rates strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group
Plc in  London . If the GDP report beats expectations “that will
continue to weigh quite heavily on gilts in terms of driving
further underperformance, cementing the view that data is indeed
starting to pick up in the U.K.,” he said.  The 10-year gilt yield climbed nine basis points, or 0.09
percentage point, to 2.40 percent at 4:45 p.m. London time. It
reached 2.41 percent, the highest since July 10. The 1.75
percent bond maturing in September 2022 fell 0.71, or 7.10
pounds per 1,000-pound ($1,536) face amount, to 94.74.  A gauge of U.K. factory orders increased to minus 12 this
month from minus 18 in June, according to the CBI figures
released today. That matched the median estimate of 13
economists in a Bloomberg News survey.  Manufacturing Index  The euro-area  manufacturing index  rose to 50.1 from 48.8 in
June, London-based Markit Economics said. That exceeds the
median estimate of 49.1 in a Bloomberg News survey. A reading
above 50 indicates growth. A preliminary index of U.S.
manufacturing increased also increased in July, Markit Economics
also said today.  Gilts handed investors a loss of 2.7 percent this year
through yesterday, according to Bloomberg World Bond Indexes.
German bonds fell 0.8 percent and Treasuries declined 2.3
percent.  Sterling was little changed at $1.5362 after rising to
$1.5392 yesterday, the highest level since June 26. The pound
traded at 86.11 pence per euro after touching 85.82 yesterday,
the strongest since July 10.  GDP increased 0.6 percent in the three months ended June
from the first quarter, when it rose 0.3 percent, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey. The scope for
the pound to rise on the data may be limited, said  Valentin Marinov , head of European Group-of-10 currency strategy at
Citigroup Inc. in London.  Rallies Accentuated  “Recent sterling rallies across the board became more
accentuated when U.K. data was coming in better than expected,”
Marinov wrote in an e-mailed note. “The bar for positive
surprises ahead of the GDP tomorrow maybe a tad too high,
however, and we remain cautious about the near-term outlook for
sterling.”  Sterling has weakened 1.7 percent this year, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The euro climbed 5 percent and the
dollar rose 4.6 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
