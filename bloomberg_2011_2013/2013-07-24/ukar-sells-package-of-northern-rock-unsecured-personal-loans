UK Asset  Resolution Ltd. (RSL) , which owns
the U.K.’s fully nationalized banks, said it agreed to sell a
portfolio of  Northern Rock  Asset Management Plc’s personal loans
for 400 million pounds ($613 million).  Performing loans are being bought by OneSavings Bank Plc,
while “the remainder” are purchased by Marlin Financial Group
Ltd., London-based UKAR said today in a statement. Marlin
Financial Group, based in London, buys distressed debt.  Northern Rock Plc separated from Northern Rock Asset
Management in 2010 and was bought by  Richard Branson ’s Virgin
Money Holdings U.K. Ltd. for an initial 747 million pounds. NRAM
will use the money to pay down its loan from the government,
according to the statement. It will write to the 140,000
customers affected by the deal.  UK Asset Resolution, formed in October 2010, repaid 4
billion pounds to taxpayers in 2012, it said in March. Northern
Rock was nationalized four years previously.  -- Editors: Simone Meier, Dylan Griffiths  To contact the reporter on this story:
