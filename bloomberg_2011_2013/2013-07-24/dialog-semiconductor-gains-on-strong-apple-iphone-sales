Dialog Semiconductor Plc (DLG)  rose to a
two-month high after  Apple Inc. (AAPL) , the German company’s biggest
customer, reported second-quarter revenue and iPhone sales that
beat analysts’ estimates.  Dialog Semiconductor  increased  as much as 7.3 percent to
12.64 euros, the highest intraday price since May 22.  Apple reported revenue of $35.3 billion, exceeding analyst
estimates of $35 billion. The Cupertino, California-based
company sold 31.2 million units of the iPhone, its best-selling
and most profitable product. Analysts had estimated 26.1 million
units on average.  “IPhone sales were especially strong, which is important
for Dialog,” Thomas Becker, a Frankfurt-based analyst at
Commerzbank AG, said by phone. “Apple did not disappoint.”  Dialog traded 6.2 percent higher at 1:42 p.m. in  Frankfurt ,
valuing the company at 852 million euros ($1.1 billion). Volume
was 5 percent more than the three-month daily average.  The Kirchheim, Germany-based company reported second-quarter revenue of $151.7 million yesterday, beating estimates
of $150.7 million. Dialog also forecast third-quarter revenue of
$190 million to $210 million excluding its iWatt unit.  The semiconductor maker gave “better-than-expected” sales
guidance for the third quarter, Chetan Udeshi, a London-based
analyst at JP Morgan Chase & Co., said in a note today. The
company appears to be supplying more semiconductors than
previously expected for new Apple devices to be released later
this year, the analyst said.  Dialog’s shares rose as much as 12 percent yesterday, the
biggest intraday gain in 1 1/2 years.  “There remains a risk to Dialog’s sales in the fourth
quarter of 2013 and beyond if the sell-through of the new Apple
devices does not improve post the launch,” Udeshi said,
remaining neutral on Dialog with a target price of 12 euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
