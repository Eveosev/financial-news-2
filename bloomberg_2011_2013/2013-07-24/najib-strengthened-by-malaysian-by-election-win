Prime Minister Najib Razak’s
governing coalition won its first by-election since  Malaysia ’s
national polls in May, preventing a fourth state assembly from
falling into opposition hands.  The vote yesterday was the first test of public sentiment
since Najib’s coalition was returned to power by its narrowest
margin since independence in 1957. Barisan Nasional went into
the poll with a one-seat majority in the Terengganu state
government following the death of an assemblyman.  Tengku Zaihan Che Ku Abd Rahman, a 37-year-old engineer,
won the Kuala Besut seat for Najib’s coalition with a 2,592-vote
majority, fending off competition from a 48-year-old businessman
from  Anwar Ibrahim ’s opposition alliance, according to the state
news service Bernama.  A loss would have been a setback for Najib as he waits to
see whether he’ll be challenged for leadership of his own party,
the United Malays Nasional Organisation, later this year.  “This is a Barisan Nasional stronghold, so it was expected
to win,” Wan Saiful Wan Jan, chief executive officer of the
Institute for Democracy and Economic Affairs, said in a phone
interview from Kuala Lumpur today. “I don’t think there is
going to be any challenge to Najib’s position.”  The opposition currently controls three of Malaysia’s 13
state assemblies, down from four before the general election.  To contact the reporter on this story:
