New World Resources Plc (NWR)  declined to
a record after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded the
unprofitable Czech miner on expectations its financial condition
will worsen as coal prices struggle to recover.  The shares slumped 6.9 percent to 17.50 koruna by close in
Prague, the steepest drop in the 13-member PX index and the
lowest close since the start of trading in May 2008. NWR has
slumped 81 percent in the past six months, the most among 16
sector  peers  tracked by Bloomberg.  Moody’s cut the corporate family rating to Caa1, nine steps
below investment grade, from B2, it said in a statement today.
NWR is preparing asset sales to shore up finances after a drop
in coking-coal prices triggered an 80.3 million-euro ($106
million) loss in the first quarter. The average price of the
commodity agreed with customers for the third quarter declined 8
percent from the previous three months, NWR said on July 18.  “Today’s downgrade of NWR’s ratings follows further
worsening in the coal price environment” and “our expectations
that market conditions will remain challenging over the next 12
to 18 month,” Paolo Leschiutta, a Moody’s analyst in Milan,
wrote in the statement. “Depressed market conditions will make
it more challenging for the company to contain cash flow
deterioration during the rest of 2013 and next year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
