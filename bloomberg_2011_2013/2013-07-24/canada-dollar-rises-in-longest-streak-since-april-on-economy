The Canadian dollar strengthened
against the majority of its 16 most-traded peers after the
biggest gain in retail sales in three years sparked bets for
faster economic growth this year.  The currency was little changed versus its U.S. counterpart
after a report yesterday showed sales in May increased 1.9
percent, almost double the highest forecast in a Bloomberg
survey of 20 economists, which had a median projection of 0.4
percent.  Canada  will report May gross domestic product figures
next week. The  Bank of Canada  sold C$3.3 billion ($3.2 billion)
of debt due in November 2015 at a yield of 1.230 percent.  “The retail sales data really put some strength back into
the Canadian dollar,” said Mazen Issa, Canada macro-strategist
at Toronto-Dominion Bank’s TD Securities, by phone from Toronto.
“We’re still expecting deceleration in growth, but maybe not as
soft.”  The loonie, as the currency is nicknamed for the image of
the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, fell 0.1 percent to C$1.0300 per
U.S. dollar at 12:45 p.m. in Toronto. It touched C$1.0263, its
highest point since June 19. One loonie buys 97.07 U.S. cents.  The currency traded stronger than its 100-day moving
average of C$1.0268 per U.S. dollar for the first time in a
month. Trading past a moving average is a signal to some traders
a move has momentum. The currency has risen from its lowest
point in almost two years reached July 5.  Fund Flows  The loonie has benefitted from the strongest international
inflows of all developed market currencies into Canada’s stocks
and bonds, Samarjit Shankar, a senior currency strategist at the
Bank of  New York  Mellon Corp. wrote in a note to clients.  Flow data shows Canadian debt has benefitted from a
recently installed central bank governor who has pushed back
expectations of higher rates as portfolio managers and central
banks search for shelter from volatility in the U.S. Treasury
market, Shankar wrote.  Canada’s benchmark 10-year  bond  fell, with yields rising
seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 2.48 percent.
The 1.5 percent security maturing in June 2023 lost 60 cents to
C$91.51.  Canada’s two-year bond auction had a bid-to-cover ratio of
2.595 times, the lowest ratio since February, according to Bank
of Canada data.  The yield on December 2013 bankers’ acceptances, a measure
of interest-rate expectations, rose for the fourth straight day
to 1.31 percent. So-called Bax contracts have settled an average
of about 0.20 percentage point above the central bank’s target
rate since 1992, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Definitely for the Canadian dollar, we’ve priced in all
the bad data we possible could,” said Eimear Daly, a currency
market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd., by phone from  London .
“There’s upside for it and we’re going to see more upside
moves.”  The loonie has risen 1 percent in the past month against
nine developed nation currencies tracked by the Bloomberg
Correlation Weighted Index. The  U.S. dollar  is down 1.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
