Boeing Co. (BA) , the world’s largest
planemaker, boosted its full-year earnings forecast after
second-quarter profit surged on higher aircraft deliveries and
lower 787 Dreamliner production costs.  Earnings excluding some pension expense will be $6.20 to
$6.40 a share in 2013, Boeing said today, up from a range of
$6.10 to $6.30 in an April projection. Profit on that basis was
$1.67 a share last quarter, topping the $1.58 average estimate
of 20 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Boeing is reaping rewards from a faster assembly pace for
its 737s, 777s and 787s as a global aviation boom boosts demand
for large jets. The planemaker shipped 169 commercial aircraft
in the quarter, up 13 percent from a year earlier, including 16
Dreamliners delivered after regulators cleared the plane to fly
in April. Boeing handed over six 787s a year earlier.  “The 787 program has been progressing well through
production after a very difficult launch,”  Douglas Harned , an
aerospace analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. in  New York ,
said in a July 19 research note. “Progress on cost reduction
also appears to be going well.”  The shares rose 1.8 percent to $109.70 at 7:42 a.m. before
regular New York trading.  Revenue rose 9 percent to $21.8 billion as Boeing delivered
more higher-margin 777 and 737 jets than a year earlier and its
defense unit landed international business to help blunt the
impact of U.S. budget cuts. Analysts had predicted sales of
$20.8 billion.  Pension Expenses  Since January, Boeing has used a profit measure -- so-called core earnings per share -- that it said gives a clearer
picture by adjusting for market fluctuations in pension
expenses. Without the adjustment, net income was $1.09 billion,
or $1.41 a share, compared with $967 million, or $1.27, a year
earlier.  Boeing’s incremental manufacturing costs for each 787
continue to drop as it smoothes out production kinks and gains
sales, falling to $73 million each in the first quarter from
$103 million in the previous quarter, Carter Copeland, a
 Barclays Plc (BARC)  analyst in New York, wrote in a July 22 report. He
expected deferred development costs to decline to $60 million a
jet in the second quarter, boosting free  cash flow .  The latest setback for the program, a July 12 fire aboard a
Dreamliner parked at  London ’s Heathrow airport, “shouldn’t have
a material impact on Boeing’s valuation,” Harned said.  Investigators are focused on an “off-the-shelf” emergency
beacon rather than a new 787 technology, raising the likelihood
the incident is a “one-off” issue costing tens or hundreds of
millions of dollars, rather than billions, he said.  The global fleet was grounded for three months this year to
fix lithium-ion battery meltdowns.  To contact the reporter on this story:
