The Australian dollar may fall to
its lowest level in almost three years against its U.S.
counterpart after failing to breach key technical levels of
resistance, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  The Aussie may decline to 87.75 per U.S. dollar, its
weakest level since Aug. 25, 2010, after bouncing off the
resistance zone from 93.05 to 93.45, according to Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical analyst at JPMorgan.
 Australia ’s legal tender increased to 93.20 today before erasing
its gain. The Aussie has been the worst-performing major
currency over the past three months, decreasing 11 percent
versus the greenback.  “The fact that we held that area near 93 today highlights
the potential risk of additional weakness,” O’Connor said in a
telephone interview. “We could see some downside follow-through. The overall setup is still bearish.”  Australia’s currency depreciated 1.7 percent, the most in a
month, to 91.39 U.S. cents at 1:37 p.m. in New York after
earlier gaining as much as 0.3 percent to 93.20.  The Aussie may appreciate to 94.40, a more than one-month
high, if it breaks through resistance at 93.45, O’Connor said.
That would be the currency’s strongest level since June 19.  “If it happened to rally to about 93.45, that would be a
positive short-term development,” O’Connor said. “But it does
look like that’s unlikely to happen given what we’ve seen in
recent price action.”  The Aussie’s 8.8 percent decline this year trails just the
yen’s 11 percent depreciation as the worst performing currency
among 10 developed-market currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The euro has gained the most with
a 5 percent climb.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
