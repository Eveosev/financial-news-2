Corn crops in northwest  Iowa  are
showing signs of below-average yields after rain delayed
planting and hot weather stunted growth, based on surveys of
five fields during the Doane Advisory Services Co. crop tour.
Soybean yields were estimated at about average.  Samples taken today in the state, the biggest U.S. producer
of both crops, indicated average corn yields of 174.8 bushels an
acre, compared with average tour estimates of 187.4 bushels from
2007 to 2011, Doane said on the third day of its 30th annual
Midwest crop tour. Yields last year were 139 bushels, as the
worst drought since the 1930s hurt plants.  “Much of the area needs rain to prevent a decline in yield
potential,” said Marty Foreman, a senior economist at St.
Louis-based researcher Doane. “A lot of the fields will average
170 to 190 bushels with timely moisture.”  The outlook for northwest fields, Iowa’s second-biggest
producing region, are better than for north-central counties,
where inspectors found more immature crops, he said.  Soybean yields measured today were estimated at 48.7
bushels an acre, compared with 48.9 bushels on average on the
crop tour from 2007 to 2011, Doane data show. Last year, the
group measured 40.7 bushels on the same route.  “It’s an average crop with some very good fields offset by
others that are short,”  Bill Nelson , a senior economist at
Doane, said in a car near Sioux City, Iowa. “Development is
behind normal, and crops need more rain and warmer” weather to
maintain current yield potential, he said.  The U.S. is the world’s largest producer of corn and
soybeans. The  U.S. Department of Agriculture  will release its
first field-based estimates of corn and soybean production on
Aug. 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
