Singapore will take “strong
measures to tighten up processes” after a senior anti-graft
official was charged in the city-state’s latest corruption case
involving public service staff.  Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong appointed an independent
review panel to probe alleged financial impropriety by an
assistant director at the Corrupt Practices Investigation
Bureau, according to a  statement  from the Prime Minister’s
Office posted on the government’s website today.  Edwin Yeo, who worked 15 years at the anti-graft agency,
was today charged with 21 counts including misappropriating
S$1.7 million ($1.3 million), corruption and fraud, according to
police charge sheets. The 39-year-old was suspended from work in
September. The case comes after the nation’s former civil
defense chief was jailed over sex-for-contracts.  “PMO is examining whether any supervisory lapses may have
contributed to this incident. If so, it will take action against
the officers responsible,” Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean
said in the statement. “As there have been a number of high
profile cases recently, the public is understandably concerned
about whether this reflects systemic issues.”  Yeo, who isn’t represented by a lawyer, didn’t enter a plea
in court, according to the  Straits Times  newspaper.  The criminal case is Public Prosecutor v Yeo Seow Hiong
Edwin. DAC028332-DAC028352/2013. Singapore Subordinate Courts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
