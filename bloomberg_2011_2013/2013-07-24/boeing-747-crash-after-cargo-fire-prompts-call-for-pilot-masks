The crash of a  Boeing Co. (BA)  747
freighter in which two  United Parcel Service Inc. (UPS)  pilots died
after a cargo fire prompted investigators to call for mandatory
full-face oxygen masks in cockpits.  Fire-suppression systems to allow pilots to focus on flying
rather than enter blazing cargo bays should be explored, along
with technology to improve visibility in smoke-filled cockpits,
the United Arab Emirates General Civil Aviation Authority said
today in a report.  The agency’s probe into the 2010 crash of UPS Flight 6 in
Dubai found that the crew became incapacitated from a fire
kindled in an area of the jumbo jet carrying  lithium batteries .
The GCAA also urged the European Aviation Safety Agency and U.S.
Federal Aviation Administration to work with Boeing to assess
whether the 747 itself requires safety enhancements.  “If a deficiency in the current level of critical systems
protection is determined, provide regulatory oversight to
mitigate the risk of control and systems damage that can result
from large cargo fires,” the GCAA said in the report on its
website.  Two other freighter blazes have been linked to lithium
battery shipments, according to the U.S. National Transportation
Safety Board. An  Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560)  747-400 went down in the
South China Sea in 2011, killing both pilots, and a UPS Boeing
DC-8 was destroyed by fire in 2006 after making an emergency
landing in Philadelphia, with three crew members escaping.  Lithium Batteries  The focus on on-board fire safety follows heightened
regulatory attention this year on lithium battery technology in
planes.  Boeing’s 787 Dreamliners were grounded worldwide for three
months after two meltdowns in January of lithium-ion batteries
that are part of the planes’ power systems. On July 12, a 787
parked at  London ’s Heathrow airport was damaged in a fire linked
to an emergency beacon that uses a different type of lithium
battery.  The UAE agency recommended that U.S. and European
regulators draft procedures for a scenario in which a crew
member is incapacitated and the plane left with a single pilot.
Cargo carriers should be required to give instruction in a smoke
simulator with full immersion training to replicate continuous
fumes, the GCAA said.  Toxic Fumes  Flight 6’s two-person crew inhaled toxic fumes from the
fire, according to the accident report. The plane, which like
the Asiana jet was a 747-400 variant, crashed near the Dubai
airport shortly after takeoff en route to Cologne,  Germany .  Since then, Atlanta-based UPS and its pilots union, the
Independent Pilots Association, have collaborated on safety
improvements including the addition of full-face pilot oxygen
masks on all Boeing 747 and MD-11 jets, the wide-body planes
typically used on the company’s longest routes.  UPS is adding the masks to other models including 767s and
757s, and they are pre-installed on  Airbus SAS (EAD)  A300 aircraft,
the company said in an e-mailed statement.  A vision assurance system enabling pilots to see clearly
through smoke has been added on UPS’s 747s, along with oxygen
masks for the jump-seat pilot, according to the carrier.  These devices “provide significant improvements on the
flight deck during an onboard smoke, fire or fume event,” union
President Robert Travis said in an e-mailed statement.  UPS has separately purchased about 1,600 metal containers
that can contain a fire for as long as four hours when combined
with an aerosol suppressant, plus 575 blaze-resistant covers for
pallet-sized shipments. Enhanced employee training will also
ensure workers recognize hazardous materials and undeclared
shipments of flammable goods, UPS said.  “UPS remains committed to aviation safety and the
prevention of such events in the future,” the company said.  While the GCAA said the exact cause of the Dubai fire was
unclear, it suggested the FAA, EASA and Boeing evaluate the
747’s cargo bay to determine if a transfer of energy from the
vibration of the fuselage to the batteries could somehow have
ignited them.  To contact the reporters on this story:
