Ethanol’s discount to gasoline
swelled to the widest level in more than three months after a
government report showed inventories advanced.  The spread rose 3.57 cents to 71.58 cents a gallon after
the Energy Information Administration said  ethanol stockpiles 
increased 4.1 percent to 17.3 million barrels, extending the
longest streak of gains since December. The U.S. made  foreign
purchases  of the biofuel for a third week.  “Ethanol imports continue to be strong,” said  Terry
Reilly , senior commodity analyst at Futures International LLC in
Chicago. “The jump in inventories eases worries that we’ll have
a shortage of ethanol.”  Denatured ethanol for August delivery fell 4 cents, or 1.7
percent, to $2.339 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Prices have gained 6.8 percent this year.  Gasoline for August delivery declined 0.43 cent to $3.0548
a gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange . The contract
covers reformulated gasoline, made to be blended with ethanol
before delivery to filling stations.  Ethanol imports have averaged 21,000 barrels a day so far
this year, more than double the same period a year earlier, data
from the Energy Department’s statistical arm show.  Production fell 2.6 percent to 853,000 barrels a day, the
lowest level since May 3, the EIA said. That’s 7.2 percent
higher than a year ago.  Ethanol is made from corn in the U.S., with one bushel
making at least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  Corn Sinks  Corn for September delivery decreased 14.25 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $5.0825 a bushel in  Chicago . The more actively
traded December contract slipped 5.25 cents to $4.8025.  The corn crush spread, or the cost difference between a
gallon of ethanol and the corn needed to make it, based on
September contracts for the grain and biofuel, was 38 cents, up
from 36 cents yesterday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The
margin was minus 35 cents on Dec. 31.  A 2007 energy law, known as the Renewable Fuels Standard,
requires the U.S. to use ethanol. Compliance with the mandate is
tracked by Renewable Identification Numbers, or RINs, that are
attached to each gallon of biofuel and can be traded among
refiners.  Corn-based ethanol RINs  slumped 5.3 percent to $1.26, the
lowest since July 12, while  advanced RINs , which cover Brazilian
sugarcane-based ethanol and biodiesel, sank 4.4 percent to
$1.30, also the cheapest since July 12, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  In cash market trading, ethanol in Chicago decreased 5.5
cents to $2.345 a gallon; in the U.S. Gulf the additive lost 3.5
cents to $2.435; in  New York  prices slid 0.5 cent to $2.45; and
on the West Coast ethanol increased 2.5 cents to $2.62 a gallon,
data compiled by Bloomberg show.  West Coast ethanol’s premium to the U.S. Gulf expanded 6
cents to 18.5 cents, the widest since June 24, while Chicago’s
discount to New York Harbor grew 5 cents to 10.5 cents, the
biggest gap since July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
