Relief pitcher Francisco Rodriguez
was traded to the Baltimore Orioles from the  Milwaukee  Brewers
for minor-league infielder Nick Delmonico.  Rodriguez, nicknamed K-Rod, is 1-1  with 10 saves and a
1.09 earned run average in 25 appearances this season.  An All-Star in 2004 and from 2007-09, Rodriguez has 304
saves during his 12-year Major League Baseball career. After
seven years with the Los Angeles Angels, Rodriguez played for
the New York Mets from 2009 into the 2011 season before being
traded to Milwaukee.  Delmonico, 20, was a sixth-round draft pick by the Orioles
in 2011. He was batting .244 in 60 games with Class-A Frederick
this season before the trade.  To make room for 31-year-old Rodriguez on Baltimoreâ€™s 40-man roster, the team transferred outfielder Nolan Reimold to the
60-day disabled list, the Orioles said last night in a news
release.  The Orioles are 57-44, 3 1/2 games behind the Boston Red
Sox for the American League East lead. The Brewers are 41-58, in
last place in the National League Central.  To contact the reporter on this story:
