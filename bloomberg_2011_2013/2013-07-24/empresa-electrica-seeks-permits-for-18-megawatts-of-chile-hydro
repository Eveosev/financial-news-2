Empresa Electrica Florin SpA, the
Chilean renewable-energy developer, is seeking permits to build
two hydroelectric plants with a total of 17.6 megawatts of
capacity.  The two projects, called Florin II and Florin III, will
together cost $53.7 million, the Santiago-based company said
yesterday in a  filing  with Chile’s environmental licensing
agency Servicio de Evaluacion Ambiental. Work on the projects is
expected to start in December.  The plants will deliver energy to the country’s central
grid Sistema Interconectado Central through an 11.1-kilometer
(6.9-mile) power line, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
