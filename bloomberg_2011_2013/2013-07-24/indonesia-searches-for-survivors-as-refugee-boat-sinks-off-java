Indonesian authorities rescued more
than 150 people and recovered at least three bodies after a boat
carrying asylum seekers sank off Java, the third fatal incident
this month as  Australia  tries to stem the flow of refugees.  The local police and immigration office reported 157 people
were rescued and three died when the boat capsized off the
island’s south coast late yesterday, Andriansyah, the head of
operations at the West Java search and rescue office, said by
telephone today. Andriansyah said his team found 36 survivors
and two bodies, and it wasn’t immediately clear whether that
tally was in addition to or included in the police numbers.  Five asylum seekers have already drowned at sea between
Australia and  Indonesia  since July 12 as the rising number of
refugees heading to Australia by boat erodes support for the
governing  Labor party  ahead of elections that must be held by
Nov. 30. Prime Minister  Kevin Rudd , who has made tackling the
issue a priority, announced last week that Australia will send
refugees arriving by boat to  Papua New Guinea .  More than 800 people, many from war-torn countries that
have used Indonesia as a stepping stone to seek asylum in
Australia, have died en route since October 2009, according to
the Department of Immigration.  The Australian Maritime Safety Authority said its offer of
assistance in today’s rescue effort had been turned down by
Indonesian authorities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
