Treasuries dropped for a second day
as the U.S. prepares to sell $35 billion in five-year notes amid
speculation the  Federal Reserve  may reduce its purchases of
 government securities  this year.  Shorter-maturity notes slid as sales of new U.S. homes rose
more than forecast in June to the highest level in five years, a
sign builders are benefiting from a lack of supply of existing
properties. Benchmark 10-year note yields rose earlier to the
highest level in a week after gauges of euro-area services and
manufacturing beat analyst estimates. The U.S. is selling $99
billion in notes this week.  “There’s been good data out of  Europe  this morning, which
started this, and you’ve got the auction coming up -- that’s
what’s weighing on the market,” said Larry Milstein, managing
director in New York of government-debt trading at R.W.
Pressprich & Co. “The yield levels will probably attract
buyers.”  Ten-year  yields  rose seven basis points, or 0.07 percentage
point, to 2.57 percent at 10:27 a.m. New York time, after
gaining as much as nine basis points, the biggest increase in
almost three weeks, Bloomberg Bond Trader data showed. The 1.75
percent note due May 2023 dropped 1/2, or $5 per $1,000 face
amount, to 92 29/32.  Yields on the  10-year note  rose to 2.75 percent on July 8,
the highest since August 2011, from a 2013 low of 1.61 percent
on May 1. They remain below the five-year average of 2.73
percent.  Volume Drops  Treasury  trading volume  at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $247.6 billion
yesterday, below the average of $274.2 billion in July.  Treasuries are little changed this month, Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes show, after falling 1.4 percent in June on concern
the Fed was moving closer to reducing the pace of its bond-buying program.  A manufacturing index based on a survey of euro-area
 purchasing managers  rose to 50.1 in July from 48.8 in June,
London-based Markit Economics said today. Analysts in a
Bloomberg survey predicted a reading of 49.1. A level of 50 is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction. A report on
services gave a reading of 49.6, versus analyst estimates for
48.7.  “We’re backing up a bit on the European purchasing
managers  index (SPX)  numbers,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, one of the Fed’s
21 primary dealers that trade government securities with the
central bank. He also cited low volume. “It’s summer trading --
flows have been very light.”  Home Sales  U.S. new-home sales climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized
pace of 497,000 homes, highest level since May 2008, the
Commerce Department said in  Washington . The median estimate of
77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain to
484,000.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks traded near
an all-time high as Apple Inc.’s profit topped estimates and
forecasts from Boeing Co. and Ford Motor Co. exceeded
predictions.  “Great earnings out of Apple and Ford” have added to
selling pressure, said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president
of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.
“It’s just another sign that things are going well, and that
will reverberate through the economy. There’s consumer demand
for good products.”  Fed Buying  The Fed will start trimming its  $85 billion  in monthly bond
purchases in September, according to a survey of economists by
 Bloomberg News .  In its first reduction, the  Federal Open Market Committee 
will probably cut monthly bond buying to $65 billion, according
to the July 18-22 survey of 54 economists. Economists project
purchases divided between $35 billion in Treasuries and $30
billion in mortgage-backed securities.  The five-year notes being auctioned today yielded 1.4
percent, versus an yield of 1.484 percent at the last sale of
the securities on June 26, the highest since July 2011.  Investors  bid  for 2.45 times the amount of debt offered
last month, the lowest level since September 2009.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, bought 3.6 percent of the
securities, the smallest amount since November 2009.  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 53 percent of the notes, the most since
January 2010.  At a $35 billion two-year auction yesterday, the  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by comparing total bids with
the amount of securities offered, was 3.08, compared with an
average of 3.54 for the prior 10 sales.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was 74.05 yesterday,
falling from this month’s high of 117.89 on July 5. The one-year
average is 64.76.  To contact the reporters on this story:
