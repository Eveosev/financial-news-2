Spot wholesale power slumped in the
Northeast and mid-Atlantic states as moderating summer heat
reduced demand.  PJM Interconnection LLC, which serves more than 60 million
people from  New Jersey  to North Carolina and Illinois, expects
peak demand on its network to slump 11 percent. The New York
Independent System Operator Inc. sees power use in  Manhattan  and
its neighboring four boroughs dropping by 7.5 percent.  The high temperature in Washington today will be 86 degrees
Fahrenheit (30 Celsius), 2 below normal, with chances of
thunderstorms, according to AccuWeather Inc. in  State College ,
Pennsylvania. Manhattan may also see a high of 86 degrees, 2
higher than the historical average.  Spot electricity for PJM’s Western hub, which includes
deliveries to Washington, slumped $8.07, or 20 percent, to
$32.06 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 10 a.m., grid

at $45.27.  Demand on the 13-state PJM network will peak at 120,234

drop to 9,440 megawatts during the 4 p.m. hour versus 10,210

above the grid operator’s forecasts.  Boston spot power increased $1.05, or 2.9 percent, to
$37.64 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at 10 a.m. from the
same time yesterday.  ISO New England Inc. said demand was 20,108 megawatts at
