Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI) , the third-largest
provider of services to drill and complete wells, said the U.S.
 Justice Department  is seeking documents for an antitrust
investigation related to the hydraulic-fracturing market.  The company received a Civil Investigative Demand, or CID,
from the department on May 30 and is working to provide the
requested documents and information on its pressure-pumping
services, Houston-based Baker Hughes said in a regulatory filing
today. The request involves information from May 29, 2011,
through the date of the demand, according to the company.  “We are not able to predict what action, if any, might be
taken in the future” by the Justice Department or other
government authorities because of the investigation, Baker
Hughes said in the filing.  The pressure-pumping technique known as fracking involves
blasting water mixed with sand and chemicals underground to free
trapped hydrocarbons from shale formations. Prices charged for
U.S. fracking services slid 14 percent in 2012 and are expected
to fall another 6 percent this year, according to PacWest
Consulting Partners LLC, a Houston-based industry adviser.  Christine Mathers, a Baker Hughes spokeswoman, didn’t
immediately return voice messages seeking comment after regular
business hours.  Schlumberger Ltd. (SLB)  and  Halliburton Co. (HAL)  are the largest
oilfield-services providers. The companies didn’t immediately
respond to phone calls and e-mails seeking comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
