Cairn India Ltd. (CAIR) , operator of the
nation’s biggest oilfield on land, reported its first decline in
quarterly profit in a year after crude prices fell.  Group net income fell 18 percent to 31.3 billion rupees
($530 million), or 16.36 rupees a share, in the three months
ended June 30 from 38.3 billion rupees, or 20.02 rupees, a year
earlier, according to an e-mailed statement today. That beat the
28.5 billion rupee median of 34 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales fell 8.6 percent to 40.6 billion rupees.  Cairn  India , acquired by  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  for $8.67
billion in 2011, plans to spend 130 billion rupees in the next
three years to discover new oil pools and boost production at
its biggest fields in Rajasthan state, Chairman Navin Agarwal
told shareholders today in Mumbai. It plans to drill more than
450 wells to raise production in the area by 67 percent to
300,000 barrels a day.  The  shares  fell 0.5 percent to 308.60 rupees in Mumbai.
They’ve declined 3.3 percent this year, compared with a 3.4
percent gain in the benchmark  S&P BSE Sensex (SENSEX)  index. The earnings
were announced after trading closed.  The company sold oil and natural gas at an average $93.3 a
barrel of oil equivalent in the quarter, compared with $99.3 a
year earlier, according to the statement. The average price of
Brent traded in  London  was $103.35 a barrel in the quarter.  Cairn India sells crude at rates linked to Brent oil prices,
unlike state-owned  Oil & Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC) , which is required to
bear part of the country’s fuel subsidy. Cairn India discovered
new oil in the Dharvi Dungar sands in Rajasthan’s Barmer
district and is evaluating the size of the reserves, according
to an April 9 stock exchange filing.  Total output from Cairn India’s fields rose 3 percent to
212,442 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Production from the
Rajasthan block is at 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day
and the company expects it to increase to as many as 215,000
barrels this financial year, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
