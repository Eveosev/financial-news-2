Dutch tax authorities have laid a
claim on nine properties and a parking spot owned by former
European soccer player of the year Ruud Gullit for not paying
enough income tax in 2010.  The properties are all located in Amsterdam, and include a
house located in the southern part of the city where Gullit’s
estranged third wife, Estelle Cruijff, lives, according to Dutch
Land Registry documents. The documents didn’t make clear how
much money Gullit owes the Dutch state.  “The Dutch Tax and Customs Administration has taken this
step in light of the financial settlement of the divorce,”
Gullit said in a statement to media in the Netherlands last
night, including De Telegraaf newspaper and broadcaster RTL. “I
regret this. I am doing everything I can to solve this as
quickly as possible.”  Gullit, 50, married 35-year-old Cruijff, the niece of
former Dutch soccer star Johan Cruijff, in 2000. The pair have
two children.  Gullit, who in recent years has worked as a commentator for
Sky Sports, captained the Netherlands to the 1988 European
Championship and won the European Cup twice with AC Milan. He
has also coached Feyenoord, the Los Angeles Galaxy, Chelsea,
Newcastle United and Russian Premier League side FC Terek
Grozny.  To contact the reporter on this story:
