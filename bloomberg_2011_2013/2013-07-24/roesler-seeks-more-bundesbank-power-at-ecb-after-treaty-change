German Vice Chancellor Philipp Roesler said the Bundesbank should exert more influence at the
 European Central Bank  after a change of European Union treaties
that may take a “long” time to accomplish.  Germany  is battling attempts by some of its 16 fellow euro-area governments to curb the independence that the ECB enjoys
from political influence, Roesler, who’s also economy minister
in Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet, said yesterday in a
Bloomberg Television interview in Berlin. He didn’t name the
governments.  “We have to change the treaties, which is a long way, but
now we are responsible for 27.1 percent of the ECB and we are
only one vote out of 17, so that’s not the right balance between
freedom of decision on one hand and responsibility on the other
hand,” Roesler said.  Less than two months before Sept. 22 federal elections,
Roesler’s comments show that he is aligning his Free Democratic
Party with Germany’s once-powerful central bank. Merkel’s junior
coalition partner rejects criticism of the Bundesbank for
delaying a banking union in  Europe  and censuring ECB bond
purchases advocated by the bank’s president,  Mario Draghi .  The Bundesbank said this week in its monthly report that EU
treaties must be changed to provide a legal basis for the
Europe-wide supervision of banks scheduled to start in the fall
of next year. Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann said June 12
that it’s questionable whether the ECB’s Outright Monetary
Transactions program is “consistent with our mandate.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
