Besalco SA (BESALCO) ,  Chile ’s largest builder
by market value, fell to the lowest in 21 months as signs of a
construction slowdown damped the outlook for profit.  Besalco slumped 3.9 percent to 645 pesos at 12:05 p.m. in
Santiago, the lowest price on a closing basis since October
2011. It was the biggest loser today on the benchmark IPSA
index, which advanced 0.5 percent. Santiago-based Besalco’s
shares have retreated 5.9 percent in the past three days.  The shares dropped on a “combination of signs of an
economic slowdown in Chile and that Besalco had been performing
better than some of its peers,” Jorge Sepulveda, an analyst at
Euroamerica Corredores de Bolsa SA, said in a phone interview.
“In a slowdown, engineering companies have to charge less to
secure projects, which erodes their profit margins.”  Construction activity in Chile grew 4.6 percent in May
year-on-year, which compares with an expansion of 11 percent in
the same month of 2012 and of 7.2 percent in December, according
to data from the Chilean Construction Chamber. Chile’s economy
will grow 4.5 percent this year, the slowest since 2009,
according to the median of estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Besalco’s shares have fallen 26 percent in 2013, less than
peers such as  Salfacorp SA (SALFACOR) , Chile’s largest builder by revenue,
which has fallen 45 percent, and  Ingevec SA (INGEVEC) , down 34 percent.  The company will report second-quarter earnings Aug. 6,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Banco Santander SA
expects Besalco to report a profit of 3 billion pesos in the
second quarter, compared with 2.8 billion pesos a year earlier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
