Cameron McRae, chief executive
officer of  Rio Tinto  Group’s Oyu Tolgoi LLC, plans to step down
from his job, three years after taking control of Mongolia’s
biggest company, according to a person familiar with the matter.  McRae’s departure at the end of his three-year contract,
which comes due in November, has been communicated within the
company, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the information isn’t public. A successor has yet to be named,
the person said. An e-mail to McRae seeking comment yesterday
wasn’t answered.  Rio Tinto (RIO) , the world’s second-biggest mining company, runs
the Oyu Tolgoi mine through its 51 percent stake in Vancouver-based  Turquoise Hill Resources (TRQ)  Ltd., which owns 66 percent of
the operation located 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the
Chinese border. Mongolia’s government owns 34 percent.  McRae has steered Oyu Tolgoi through an inception that has
included shareholder clashes over cost over-runs, tax payments
and a lack of local participation in the management of the $6.6
billion copper and gold mine. Enough of the disputes were
resolved to allow the project to begin copper shipments earlier
this month, after two postponements as Mongolia sought to ensure
revenue from the mine is passed through domestic banks.  Rio is considering an expansion of Oyu Tolgoi, which would
involve building an underground mine. The work may cost $5.1
billion, Turquoise Hill said in a March report. Financing is
awaiting approval.  To contact the reporter on this story:
