The rupiah fell to a four-year low
as a manufacturing gauge in  China  trailed forecasts, spurring
concern Indonesia’s current-account deficit will widen.  The rupiah extended losses after dropping by the most in 13
months yesterday as  Bank Indonesia  allowed a more rapid slide
toward levels quoted in the offshore market. China’s preliminary
 Purchasing Managers ’ Index was 47.7 in July, compared with the
48.2 median estimate in a Bloomberg survey, where readings below
50 indicate contraction, HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
said today. The world’s second-largest economy took 10 percent
of Indonesia’s non-oil exports in May, official data show.  “We are looking to revise our current-account deficit
target higher,” said Leo Rinaldy, a Jakarta-based economist at
PT Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of the nation’s largest bank.
“There’s good reason to worry since the impact of China’s
slowdown will extend to the rest of  Southeast Asia  and weigh on
our trade outlook.”  The rupiah declined 0.4 percent to 10,241 per dollar as of
9:52 a.m. in Jakarta, according to prices from local banks. It
touched 10,276 earlier, the weakest level since July 13, 2009.
The currency traded at a 1.7 percent premium to the one-month
non-deliverable forwards, which fell 0.4 percent to 10,420. A
 fixing  by the Association of Banks in  Singapore  that is used to
settle the rupiah contracts was set at 10,204 yesterday.  Southeast Asia’s largest economy recorded trade shortfalls
in seven of the eight months through May, and its current
account has been in  deficit  for the six quarters through March.  New Equilibrium  The  exchange-rate  is in line with economic fundamentals and
is moving toward a new equilibrium, Bank Indonesia said in a
statement late yesterday. The central bank will continue to
maintain the currency’s stability, it said.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the exchange rate used to price options, fell 30 basis points,
or 0.30 percentage point, to 12.43 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  The  Finance Ministry  raised 5.27 trillion rupiah ($515
million) from an Islamic bond auction yesterday, compared with a
1.5 trillion rupiah goal, it said in a statement on its website.
Demand for the nation’s debt probably increased as the cheaper
rupiah attracted foreign funds, Rinaldy said.  The yield on the 5.625 percent notes due May 2023 climbed
four basis points to 7.47 percent, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. The yield fell 87 basis points in the
previous five days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
