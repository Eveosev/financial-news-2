China Merchants Bank Co. (3968)  fell by the
most in almost two weeks in  Shanghai  after winning approval for
a share sale that may be the largest by a Chinese lender since
2011 as the industry moves to shore up capital.  The shares dropped as much as 3.4 percent to 10.68 yuan,
the steepest intraday decline since July 12, and traded at 10.86
yuan as of 2:17 p.m. local time. They declined 1.6 percent to
HK$13.32 in  Hong Kong . A gauge of  financial  stocks in the CSI
300 Index of the biggest companies traded in Shanghai and
Shenzhen slumped 2.5 percent, the most of 10 industry groups.  Merchants Bank will sell about 3.07 billion new shares in
Shanghai “as soon as possible” because approval from the  China 
Securities Regulatory Commission will expire in six months, the
Shenzhen-based lender said in a  statement  to the Shanghai
exchange yesterday.  The approval follows a crackdown on short-term financing
last month that’s tightened liquidity among the nation’s
lenders. The June cash crunch, China’s worst in at least a
decade, exposed smaller banks’ reliance on financing such as
wealth management products, savings vehicles that offer interest
higher than the central bank benchmark, to fund growth.  “ Merchants Bank ’s rights issue may spur market worries
about another wave of refinancing on the markets,” Shenyin &
Wanguo Securities Co. analysts Ni Jun and Xu Bingyu wrote in a
note today. “This will weigh on banks’ valuations in the short
term.”  Low Valuations  The CSI 300’s  financial index , which also tracks property
developers and insurers, trades at a record low of 6.3 times 12-month projected profit, according to weekly data compiled by
Bloomberg going back to 2007. China Merchants Bank is valued at
4.8 times, also an all-time low, the data show.  Industrial Bank Co., which trades for 3.8 times profit,
sank 2.2 percent in Shanghai. Huaxia Bank Co., valued at 3.9
times, slumped 2.9 percent, the most in almost two weeks.  China’s lenders may need to raise $50 billion to $100
billion over the next two years to maintain their  capital ratios 
as policy makers speed up a plan to have  interest rates  set by
the market, according to Shanghai-based research firm ChinaScope
Financial.  China Merchants’ Shanghai share sale plan may raise about
30.55 billion  yuan , according to Shenyin & Wanguo. That would
make it the largest since China Construction Bank Co. raised
41.9 billion yuan in November 2011, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Industrial Bank Co. raised 23.67 billion yuan from
a stock sale in January this year.  Merchants Bank extended a plan to raise as much as 35
billion yuan ($5.7 billion) in Shanghai and Hong Kong by a year
from Sept. 8, it said earlier this week.  The People’s Bank of China on July 20 ended a floor on
borrowing costs previously set at 30 percent below the
benchmark, in the biggest step yet by China’s new leaders to
move the nation’s financial system toward market-set rates.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
