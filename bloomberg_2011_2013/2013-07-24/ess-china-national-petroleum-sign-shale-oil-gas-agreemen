Hess Corp., the New York-based
energy company, and China National Petroleum Corp., parent of
that nation’s biggest oil producer, signed a cooperation
agreement for a shale basin in the western Xinjiang region.  The accord covers the Malang Block of the Santanghu Basin,
according to a  statement  posted today by CNPC on its website.
Terms weren’t disclosed.  Jon Pepper , a spokesman for Hess,
confirmed the agreement and declined to elaborate on it.  Hess and CNPC’s Hong Kong-listed  PetroChina Co. (857)  unit
earlier agreed to a joint study of potential oil and gas
production from 200,000 acres in the Santanghu Basin, according
to Hess’s Feb. 28 annual report.  CNPC President Liao Yongyuan met Hess Executive Vice
President Gregory P. Hill yesterday at a signing ceremony in
Beijing, according to the statement. PetroChina Vice President
Zhao Zhengzhang was present at the meeting, CNPC said.  Hess declined 0.8 percent to $72.88 at 11:09 a.m. in New
York. The shares have risen 38 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
