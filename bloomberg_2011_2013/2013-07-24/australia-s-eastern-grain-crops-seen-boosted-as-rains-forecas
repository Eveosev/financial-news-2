Grain-growing regions in parts of
eastern  Australia  are set for a wetter-than-normal three months,
boosting wheat-production prospects before harvesting.  The chance of exceeding median  rainfall  for August to
October is more than 80 percent in southern New South Wales,
most of Victoria and southeast  South Australia , the Bureau of
Meteorology said on its website today. Grain regions in  Western
Australia  have a roughly equal chance of a wetter- or drier-than-normal three months, it said.  Wheat output in Australia, the third-biggest exporter, is
set to gain 15 percent to 25.4 million metric tons in 2013-2014,
the government estimates. Wheat tumbled 16 percent in  Chicago 
this year as the U.S. Department of Agriculture forecasts world
 production  to climb 6.5 percent to a record 697.8 million tons
in 2013-2014 on bigger harvests in Russia and the European Union.
Australian farmers begin harvesting from about November.  “It’s positive for production on the east coast,” said
 Paul Deane , an agricultural economist at Australia & New Zealand
Banking Group Ltd. in Melbourne. “In Western Australia, the
risk there is increasingly for average at best yields, or even
below-trend.”  Western Australia may overtake New South Wales as the
country’s biggest producer after dry weather curbed output last
year, the Australia Bureau of Agricultural and Resource
Economics and Sciences said in June. The U.S. was the biggest
exporter in 2012-2013, followed by the E.U. and Australia,
according to the USDA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
