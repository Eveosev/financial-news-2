Arizona Senator John McCain praised the  selection  of Caroline Kennedy to be the next ambassador to Japan saying that her "prestige" will be an important commodity in that country. The Obama administration earlier today announced the appointment of Kennedy, the daughter of the late president John F. Kennedy, to be the new envoy to Japan. She will have to be confirmed by the Senate. "For I've always thought appointing someone who is 'highly regarded' to the Japan post is important", McCain told me. Noting that leading lawmakers like former Senate Majority leaders like Mike Mansfield and Howard Baker and former House Speaker Tom Foley have held that post as well. The Kennedy family, especially the late president, are revered in Japan. The support of a prominent Republican like McCain should facilitate her confirmation. (Albert R.
