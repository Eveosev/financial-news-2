Human papillomavirus , the microbial
cause of most cervical cancers, has been implicated in tumors of
the genitals, anus, and throat -- including the type  Michael Douglas  had. Now scientists have linked it to esophageal cancer.  People with the virus, also known as HPV, which can be
spread by oral sex, had a threefold increased risk of developing
 esophageal cancer  than those not infected, according to a study
led by researchers at the University of New South Wales in
Sydney.  The finding, published today in the journal PLOS One, adds
HPV infection to other known risk factors -- smoking and
excessive alcohol consumption -- for a malignancy that kills
about 406,000 people worldwide each year, the scientists said.
The research showed a “robust” association between HPV and
esophageal cancer, said co-author Raina MacIntyre, a professor
of infectious disease epidemiology at the university.  “For a long time people have just said it’s uncertain, the
jury is out,” she said in a telephone interview.  The finding adds to evidence supporting the use of
 GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK) ’s Cervarix and  Merck & Co. (MRK) ’s Gardasil
vaccines that protect against sexually transmitted HPV. Strains
of the virus, which also causes warts, are particularly
prevalent in  China ,  South Africa  and Iran, the study said.  “Given that the two most-common cervical cancer-causing
HPVs are now preventable by early vaccination, this may be
significant,” MacIntyre said. Esophageal cancer has a high
case-fatality rate because it’s typically detected after the
tumor has advanced, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
