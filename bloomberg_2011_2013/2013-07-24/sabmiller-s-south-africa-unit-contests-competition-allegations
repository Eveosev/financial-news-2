SABMiller Plc (SAB) , the world’s second-largest brewer, will continue to contest allegations by  South
Africa ’s Competition Commission relating to distribution systems
and pricing at its South African unit, the company said today.  “We remain confident that none of our practices are in
breach of the law and that we have not engaged in any anti-competitive behaviour,” Yolanda Cuba, SAB strategy director,
said in an e-mailed response to questions.  The case being heard by the country’s Competition Tribunal
is the result of an investigation between 2004 and 2007 after a
complaint by a wholesaler who said that South African Breweries
charged him the same price it charged retailers, preventing him
from “earning a fair margin” on his sales to retailers, the
company said. The  Competition Commission ’s investigations
resulted in allegations of resale price maintenance, price
discrimination and an abuse of dominance.  The antitrust authority wants discounts offered to SAB’s
own appointed liquor distributors extended to all liquor
distributors, Johannesburg-based newspaper Business Day reported
today. Extending discounts to independent distributors would
cost the company 729 million rand ($75 million) a year, the
newspaper said, citing David Unterhalter, counsel for the
company. Unterhalter and Competition Commission spokeswoman
Keitumetse Letebele didn’t immediately respond to requests for
comment.  SABMiller, which started selling beer to South African gold
prospectors in 1895, applied to have the case dismissed in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
