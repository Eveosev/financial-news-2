Onomichi Dockyard Co. will use more
imported steel from South Korea after settling price talks with
 Posco (005490)  before resolving discussions with its supplier in Japan.  The shipbuilder has agreed with Posco to accept a price
increase of about 5,000 yen ($50) a metric ton for the three
months to Sept. 30, or less than 10 percent more than the
previous quarter, President Takashi Nakabe said yesterday in an
interview.  Nippon Steel & Sumitomo Metal Corp. (5401) , the world’s
second-largest steelmaker, and  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , its largest
auto customer, agreed to raise prices by 10 percent, the Nikkei
newspaper said yesterday.  Onomichi’s decision reflects the pressure on Japanese
shipyards to save money on steel as overcapacity curbs earnings.
Kobe-based Onomichi is unable to accept price increases of more
than 5,000 yen a ton, Nakabe said.  While still negotiating prices with domestic supplier  JFE
Holdings Inc. (5411) ’s steelmaking unit, Onomichi plans to boost its
purchases of steel from Pohang-based Posco to about 15 percent
this quarter from 10 percent in the previous three months,
Nakabe said. Kim Ji Young, a Seoul-based spokeswoman at Posco,
declined to comment.  “I’d like domestic mills to consider competition with
overseas suppliers more seriously,” Nakabe said in the
interview. “Imported steel prices and Japan’s export prices
remain lower than what domestic mills offer in Japan.”  Raw Material Costs  Japanese steel companies have been seeking increases to
absorb higher raw material costs and the weakening of the
domestic currency. Nippon Steel and Toyota agreed to raise steel
prices by 10,000 yen ($100) per ton for the first half of the
year to March 2014, compared with the previous six months, the
Nikkei newspaper reported yesterday without saying where it got
the information.  The price of Nippon’s steel products averaged 77,700 yen
per ton in the six months ended March 31, according to a May 10
statement from the Tokyo-based company. JFE Steel Corp.’s
average price was 68,400 yen in the period, the parent company
said on April 23. 　  Closely held Onomichi, which operates shipyards in southern
 Japan ’s Hiroshima prefectures, got all its steel from JFE before
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008, according
to Nakabe. It uses 7,000 tons to 8,000 tons of steel per month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
