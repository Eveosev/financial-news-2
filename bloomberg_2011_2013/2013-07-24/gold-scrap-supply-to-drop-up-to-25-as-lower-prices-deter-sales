Gold supply from recycled materials
may fall by as much as 25 percent this year as lower prices
deter holders from selling the metal at a time when physical
demand is strengthening, according to the World Gold Council.  Scrap bullion supply may fall by 300 to 400 metric tons in
2013 from about 1,600 tons last year, according to Marcus Grubb,
managing director of investment research at the gold council in
 London . Recycling accounted for 37 percent of total supply last
year, according to Barclays Plc, which forecasts recycled sales
of the metal to fall by 174 tons this year.  Gold is heading for the first annual drop in 13 years after
some investors lost faith in the metal as a store of value,
cutting bullion-backed fund holdings to the lowest since May
2010. Prices rebounded 13 percent from an almost three-year low
last month as demand for jewelry and coins rose. Many gold
holders sold metal when prices were higher and others are
probably waiting for a rebound, Grubb said.  “They think it’s a bad time to sell their gold,” Grubb
said in an interview two days ago in London.  Gold for immediate delivery fell 20 percent this year to
$1,338.95 an ounce, and reached a 34-month low of $1,180.50 on
June 28. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI gauge of 24 commodities rose
0.2 percent since January started and the MSCI All-Country World
Index of equities gained 11 percent. Treasuries lost 2.4
percent, a Bank of America Corp. index shows.  Federal Reserve  Bullion dropped a record 23 percent in the second quarter
as the  Federal Reserve  indicated it may slow its monthly debt
buying if the economy improves. While Fed Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said last week it’s too early to decide whether to
begin scaling back bond purchases in September, half the
economists in a July 18-22 Bloomberg survey said the central
bank will trim the bond buying that month.  Rising demand helped push July futures on the Comex in  New
York  above the August contract this month. Backwardation, when
nearby contracts are more expensive than longer-dated futures,
can signal concern about near-term supply. One-month gold
forward offered  rates , which show the  interest rate  at which
dealers will lend gold for dollars, were the most negative since
2008 earlier this month, driving the cost of borrowing the metal
to a 4 1/2-year high in London.  Tanaka Kikinzoku Kogyo K.K.,  Japan ’s biggest gold retailer,
said July 18 that its sales tripled in the second quarter from
the previous three months. Imports by  India  may climb to more
than 900 metric tons in 2013 from 860 tons last year, and
 China ’s purchases may top 1,000 tons, up from 817 tons, the
producer-funded council said July 17.  Temporary Rebound  Gold’s favorable conditions are “temporary” and prices
will resume declines as U.S. monetary policy becomes “less
ample,” ABN Amro Group NV wrote in a report yesterday. It sees
gold falling to $1,100 by the end of this year.  Recycling of gold peaked in 2010 when sales reached 1,719
tons, Barclays estimates. Gold prices climbed to a record
$1,921.15 an ounce the next year. Scrapping slowed since because
many people had already sold their metal, Grubb said.  The second half of the year usually sees gains in physical
demand for wedding seasons and religious festivals in  Asia ,
including India and China, the biggest consumers.  Demand Risk  India, last year’s top buyer, poses a risk to demand
because it added to restrictions on bullion imports. The nation
doubled a tax on inbound shipments to 8 percent this year and
curbed financing to trim its trade deficit. It announced new
rules this week making it mandatory for importers to set aside
20 percent for re-exports as jewelry.  Investors sold 660.2 tons of gold from  exchange-traded
products  this year, wiping $57 billion from the value of the
funds, data compiled by Bloomberg show. They held 1,971.7 tons
yesterday, the least since May 2010.  While ETP investors are cutting holdings after increasing
them every year since the first product was listed in 2003,
central banks continued adding to their  gold reserves . Nations
bought almost 535 tons last year, the most since 1964, according
to the council. Purchases will probably be about 400 tons this
year, Grubb said.  “Gold has made the strong gains due to robust physical
demand,” Mark O’Byrne, executive director of Dublin-based
brokerage GoldCore Ltd., said yesterday in a report. There’s
“been significant short covering due to concerns about gold
backwardation,” he said, referring to purchases to close out
bets on price drops.  To contact the reporter on this story:
