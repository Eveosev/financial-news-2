The U.S. Supreme Court’s
favorability rating fell below 50 percent for the first time in
almost three decades of Pew Research Center  polling , driven by a
drop in black support after rulings on minority rights.  The nationwide survey found that 48 percent of all those
responding had a favorable impression of the court, with 38
percent holding an unfavorable opinion. That’s down from 52
percent support in March, before the court issued the highest-profile rulings of its term, and from 80 percent in 1994, when
the court’s popularity peaked.  The decline in support was especially acute among blacks,
44 percent of whom have a favorable impression of the court,
down from 61 percent in March. Support among whites was at 49
percent, the same as in March.  Last month the court, under Chief Justice  John Roberts ,
struck down a core provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, the
landmark law that opened the polls to millions of Southern
blacks. In addition, the court tightened the limits on
university affirmative action programs, telling judges to give
those policies closer scrutiny.  The court also cleared the way for same-sex weddings to
resume in  California  and overturned a federal law that denied
benefits to legally married same-sex couples.  The poll, conducted July 17-21, had a margin of error of 3
percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
