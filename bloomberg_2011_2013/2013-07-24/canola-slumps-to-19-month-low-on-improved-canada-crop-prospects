Canola futures tumbled to a 19-month
low in Winnipeg on signs that warm, wet weather across the
Canadian Prairies is improving prospects for bigger crops this
year.  Saskatchewan , the largest growing province, reported July
18 that 80 percent of the crop was in good or excellent
condition.  Alberta , the No. 2 producer, said July 19 that 88
percent of its fields got the top ratings. The Canadian
government on July 17 boosted its crop forecast by 3.5 percent
from a month earlier, predicting farmers will collect 14.6
million metric tons this year, up 9.7 percent from 2012 and the
highest since the record harvest of 14.61 million in 2011.  “You’ve got very good crop conditions across Western
 Canada ,” Tony Tryhuk, branch manager for RBC commodity futures
trading division, said in a telephone interview from Winnipeg.
“You’ve got what appears to be -- at least, fingers crossed --
a record crop anticipated for fall harvest in canola.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell 1.5 percent to
settle at C$505.20 ($489.53) a ton at 1:36 p.m. on the ICE
Futures Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching $502.50, the lowest
for the most-active contract since Dec. 14, 2011. Prices have
tumbled 12 percent since June 3 and are 17 percent lower than a
year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
