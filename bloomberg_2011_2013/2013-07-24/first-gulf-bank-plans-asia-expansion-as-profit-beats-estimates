First Gulf Bank PJSC (FGB)  said it will
remain focused on expansion in Asia as the lender controlled by
Abu Dhabi’s ruling family reported a 15 percent increase in
second-quarter profit.  Net income  advanced to 1.17 billion dirhams ($319 million)
from 1.02 billion dirhams a year earlier, the bank said in a
statement. The mean estimate of six analysts was for a profit of
1.08 billion dirhams, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  First Gulf Bank joins  National Bank of Abu Dhabi PJSC (NBAD)  and
 Emirates NBD PJSC (EMIRATES)  in seeking to diversify its business through
expansion outside the United Arab Emirates. Emirates NBD, which
bought BNP Paribas’ Egypt unit, said it plans to open
representative offices in Asia, while National Bank of  Abu
Dhabi ’s Paris unit plans to raise 1 billion euros ($1.3 billion)
to help expand in Europe.  “Our geographic expansion over the coming quarters remains
focused on Asia,” First Gulf Bank’s Chief Executive Officer
Andre Sayegh said in the statement. Global operations
contributed 7 percent of profit compared with 5 percent a year
earlier.  Corporate and retail fees grew 34 percent to 460 million
dirhams, while net interest and Islamic financing income
increased 9 percent to 1.48 billion dirhams. The bank last month
agreed to buy Dubai First, a consumer financial services
business owned by Dubai Financial Group LLC.  To contact the reporter on this story:
