Unibail-Rodamco SE (UL) , Europe’s largest
publicly traded property owner, said first-half recurring profit
rose 10 percent after new and expanded shopping malls added to
rental income.  Earnings excluding changes in asset values and proceeds
from sales of assets, or recurring profit, increased to 499
million euros ($660 million), or 5.21 euros a share, from 453
million euros, or 4.94 euros, a year earlier, the Paris-based
company said in a statement today.  Unibail-Rodamco (UL)  plans to spend about 6.9 billion euros over
the next five years developing new shopping malls and office
buildings in Europe. The real estate investment trust is leasing
more space to leisure operators as it seeks to draw more
shoppers to its malls to counter  Europe ’s sluggish economy.  “These results confirm the group’s continued capacity to
grow and outperform in a difficult macro-economic environment
and the resilience of its business model, focused on large and
high footfall shopping and leisure destinations in Europe’s
wealthiest cities,” Chief Executive Officer Christophe Cuvillier said in the statement.  Rental income climbed to 657 million euros in the first
half from 648 million euros a year earlier, according to the
statement. Shopping mall rental income was up 4.7 percent on a
like-for-like basis. Net asset value rose to 141.30 euros a
share from 138.40 euros at the end of last year.  The company owns properties valued at about 30.5 billion
euros, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:  Neil Callanan in London at
