Chinese Estates Holdings Ltd. (127) , the
developer controlled by Hong Kong billionaire Joseph Lau, gained
the most in more than four years after saying it will pay a
special dividend to shareholders.  The shares rose 9.1 percent, the most since June 2009, to
HK$14.90 at 2:08 p.m. local time.  Chinese Estates will pay HK$1.30 per share in a special
dividend in addition to a 20 Hong Kong cents per share interim
dividend, after posting a 41 percent increase in first-half
underlying profit, the company said in a statement to Hong
Kong’s stock exchange today.  Lau is being sued by the Macau government for bribery and
money-laundering after it last year invalidated the land
concession for several sites in the city acquired by Chinese
Estates. Lau, 61 according to the company’s annual report
published in April, hasn’t shown up to the trial citing health
reasons, according to reports by Radio Television Hong Kong.  Lau, his associates and family own about 75 percent of
Chinese Estates, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. He has
a net worth of about $5.3 billion, according to  Bloomberg
Billionaires Index .  To contact the reporter on this story:
