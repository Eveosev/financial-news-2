Hog prices fell for the first time
in three days on speculation that cooler weather in the U.S.
will allow animals to gain weight before slaughter, increasing
pork supplies. Cattle rose.  Over the next six to 10 days, cooler-than-normal conditions
are projected from the northern Great Plains to the Midwest and
Southeast, according to MDA Weather Services. Hog-carcass
 weights  dropped 1 percent last week, the second straight
decline, government data show, as temperatures and humidity
rose. Hogs eat less in the heat.  “The cooler temperatures are going to result in hogs
eventually growing very well,”  Mark Schultz , a chief analyst at
Northstar Commodity Investment Co. in  Minneapolis , said in a
telephone interview.  Hog futures for October settlement declined 0.2 percent to
86.125 cents a pound at 9:50 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange. Prices rose 1.6 percent in the previous two days.  Cattle futures for October delivery added 0.3 percent to
$1.263 a pound on the CME.  Feeder-cattle futures for August settlement rose 0.1
percent to $1.537 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
