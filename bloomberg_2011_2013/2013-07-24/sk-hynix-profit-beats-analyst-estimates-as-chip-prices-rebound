SK Hynix Inc. (000660) , the world’s second-largest maker of computer-memory chips, posted profit that
exceeded analysts’ estimates buoyed by a rise in prices of
semiconductors used for personal computers and mobile devices.  Net income, excluding minority interest, rose to 946.8
billion won ($851 million) in the three months ended June from a
loss of 53 billion won a year earlier, Icheon, South Korea-based
SK Hynix said in a filing today. That compares with the 769
billion won average of 18 analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg.  SK Hynix, which makes memory chips for global smartphone
manufacturers including Apple Inc., may benefit from orders from
rival  Samsung Electronics Co. (005930)  whose semiconductor unit has
struggled to meet soaring demand. Global shipments of the
handsets are expected to rise about 32 percent to 928 million
units this year, market research firm TrendForce said in a July
23 report.  “The earnings recovery will continue well into the second
half of the year,” Doh Hyun Woo, a Seoul-based Mirae Asset
Securities Co. said before the earnings release. “Despite
recent concerns over declining demand for high-end smartphones,
we believe rising demand for low-end smartphones in  China  will
offset any decline.”  Hynix  shares  rose 0.5 percent to 28,700 won at 10:11 a.m.
in  Seoul , extending this year’s gain to 12 percent. The
benchmark Kospi index has dropped 4.5 percent in 2013.  Operating profit , or sales excluding the cost of goods sold
and administrative costs, rose to 1.11 trillion won on sales of
3.93 trillion won.  Lower-end smartphones will drive demand for dynamic random-access memory, or DRAM, chips in the second half, SK Hynix said
in an e-mailed statement. There is limited second half supply
growth for memory chips, according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
