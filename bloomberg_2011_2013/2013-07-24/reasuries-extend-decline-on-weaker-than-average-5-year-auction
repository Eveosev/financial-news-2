Treasuries declined a second day as
the U.S. sale of $35 billion in five-year notes was met with
weaker-than-average demand amid speculation the  Federal Reserve 
will reduce its bond purchases this year.  The debt’s  bid-to-cover  ratio, which gauges demand by
comparing total bids with the amount of securities offered, was
2.46, down from an average of 2.8 for the past 10 sales. The
sale follows lower than demand at yesterday’s $35 billion
auction of two-year notes. The U.S. will sell $39 billion in
seven-year notes tomorrow.  “It’s a weak market having to absorb supply,”  John Briggs , a U.S. government-bond strategist in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut , at Royal Bank of  Scotland ’s RBS Securities unit,
one of the Fed’s 21 primary dealers required to bid at Treasury
auctions. “Our bias is toward higher yields, and I think we can
probably still keep testing higher.”  The  yield  on the current five-year note rose seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 1.38 percent, at 5 p.m. in
 New York , according to Bloomberg Bond Trader Prices. It earlier
added 10 basis points. The  yield  on the benchmark 10-year  note 
gained eight basis points to 2.59 percent after earlier jumping
12 basis points. Both advances are the largest since July 5.  The Fed, which has been buying  $85 billion  in bond
purchases a month to support the economy, will start trimming
purchases in September, according to a survey of economists by
Bloomberg News. In its first reduction, the  Federal Open Market
Committee  will probably cut monthly bond buying to $65 billion,
according to the July 18-22 survey of 54 economists.  Volume, Volatility  Treasury  trading  volume at ICAP Plc, the largest inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , was $344.5 billion,
the most in a week and above the average of $277.5 billion in
July.  Volatility in Treasuries as measured by the Merrill Lynch
Option Volatility Estimate MOVE Index was at 80.20, up from
72.62 on July 22, the lowest level since May 24. The figure is
down from 117.89 on July 5, the highest since December 2010. The
one-year average is 64.83.  The notes sold today drew a  yield  of 1.410 percent,
compared with 1.484 percent last month, the most since July
2011, and a forecast of 1.413 percent in a  Bloomberg News  survey
of seven primary dealers.  Bidder Participation  Indirect bidders , an investor class that includes foreign
central banks, purchased 53.9 percent of the notes, the most
since November 2009, and an average of 43 percent for the past
10 sales.  Direct bidders , non-primary-dealer investors that place
their bids directly with the Treasury, purchased 8.3 percent of
the notes at the sale, compared with 3.6 percent at the last
sale, the least since November 2009, and an average of 16.1
percent for the past 10 auctions.  Primary dealers  bought 37.8 percent of the notes, the least
since May.  Five-year notes have lost 1.9 percent this year, compared
with a decline of 2.5 percent by  Treasuries (USGG5YR)  overall, according
to Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes. The five-year
securities returned 2.3 percent in 2012, while Treasuries
overall rose 2.2 percent.  The $35 billion in two-year debt was sold yesterday at a
yield of  0.338 percent .  New Cash  This week’s sales, plus an auction of $15 billion of 10-year Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities last week, will
raise $54.6 billion of new cash, as maturing securities held by
the public total $59.4 billion, according to the  U.S. Treasury .  Investors bid $2.92 for each dollar of the $1.228 trillion
in U.S. government notes and bonds sold at auction this year,
according to Treasury data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s down
from the record $3.15 for the $2.153 trillion sold at last
year’s offerings.  A manufacturing  index (SPX)  based on a survey of euro-area
 purchasing managers  rose to 50.1 in July from 48.8 in June,
London-based Markit Economics said today. Analysts in a
Bloomberg survey predicted a reading of 49.1. A level of 50 is
the dividing line between expansion and contraction. A report on
services gave a reading of 49.6, versus analyst estimates for
48.7.  “We’re backing up a bit on the European purchasing
managers index numbers,” said Justin Lederer, an interest-rate
strategist in New York at Cantor Fitzgerald LP, a primary
dealer.  ‘Consumer Demand’  U.S. new-home sales climbed 8.3 percent to an annualized
pace of 497,000 homes, highest level since May 2008, the
Commerce Department said in  Washington . The median estimate of
77 economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a gain to
484,000.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of U.S. stocks traded near
an all-time high as Apple Inc.’s profit topped estimates and
forecasts from Boeing Co. and Ford Motor Co. exceeded
predictions.  “Great earnings out of Apple and Ford” have added to
selling pressure, said  Michael Franzese , senior vice president
of fixed-income trading at ED&F Man Capital Markets in New York.
“It’s just another sign that things are going well, and that
will reverberate through the economy. There’s consumer demand
for good products.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
