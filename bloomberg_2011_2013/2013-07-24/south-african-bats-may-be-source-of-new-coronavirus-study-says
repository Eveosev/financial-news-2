South African bats may be the source
of the new coronavirus that’s killed 45 people, mostly in  Saudi
Arabia , according to a study published in the journal Emerging
Infectious Diseases.  A virus found in the feces of a bat in  South Africa ’s
KwaZulu-Natal and Western Cape provinces is more closely related
to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, or MERS-CoV,
than any other known virus, researchers from the University of
Stellenbosch, near Cape Town, and the University of Bonn  wrote 
in the article today.  The finding sheds new light on a pathogen that has infected
at least 90 people and  killed half of them  since September,
according to the Geneva-based  World Health Organization , but
whose origin remains unknown. Africa has been the source of
other viruses found in the  Middle East , such as Rift Valley
fever virus, which caused a severe outbreak in Saudi Arabia in
2000, the authors wrote.  More studies of bats and potential intermediate hosts such
as camels “are urgently needed to elucidate the emergence of
MERS-CoV,” the researchers said. “Such studies should focus on
the Arabian Peninsula and Africa.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
