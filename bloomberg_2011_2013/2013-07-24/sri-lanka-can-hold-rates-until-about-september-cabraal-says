Sri Lanka’s central bank is seeing
improvements in the economy, Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal said
in an interview with Zeb Eckert on Bloomberg Television after
keeping benchmark borrowing costs unchanged today.  On monetary policy:  “Keeping the  rates  on hold at this juncture seems
appropriate strategy and we have done that. The conditions that
we have now seem to support the position that we should be able
to keep rates without making any changes up until about
September. We would be most eager to ensure that the steady
expansion of the economy could be supported on a continuous
basis and that’s how we would like to see the next few months
playing out.”  On economic growth:  “We have seen the improvements in the second and the third
quarters already taking shape, which means that the growth
forecast appears to be in line with our target and we would keep
that number steady until such time that we have seen the final
numbers of the first half and then we would decide whether any
change is required. But as of now, 7.5 percent seems quite in
line with the expectations that we have had.”  On  China  and  Japan :  “The Chinese economy as well as Japanese economy are both
very important economies for us because a large amount of
investment comes in to Sri Lanka from China, and a large amount
of inputs comes into Sri Lanka from Japan.  ‘‘The impact on Sri Lanka as far as the Chinese growth is
concerned may not be extremely vital for us right now. I think
the current conditions that we see in both Japan and China seem
to be not unfavorable to Sri Lanka and we would take the view
that it should help us in the long term.’’  To contact the reporters on this story:
