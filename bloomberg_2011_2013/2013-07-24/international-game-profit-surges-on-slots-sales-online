International Game Technology (IGT) , the
world’s largest maker of  slot machines , reported a 41 percent
increase in third-quarter profit as casinos stepped up purchases
and the company increased online revenue from casino-like games.  Profit excluding some items totaled 33 cents a share,
beating the 31-cent average of 16 analysts’ estimate compiled by
Bloomberg. Sales rose 8.7 percent to $579 million from a year
earlier, according to a statement today from Las Vegas-based
International Game. That missed estimates of $582.9 million.  Slot-machine sales increased 12 percent to $259.2 million,
spurred by deals in  Canada , and interactive revenue jumped 69
percent $72.5 million, the company said. The weak division was
gaming operations, which runs networks of machines such as
“Wheel of Fortune” on behalf of casino partners. Revenue at
the unit fell 4 percent to $247.3 million.  “It’s the one that feels the brunt of consumer
descretionary challenges the most,” Chief Financial Officer
John Vandemore said in a telephone interview. “People aren’t
spending as much as they used to on gaming-related activities.”  Net income rose to $65.7 million, or 25 cents a share, from
$46.6 million, or 16 cents, a year earlier. The results
underscore the wisdom of the company’s expansion into online
gambling, Chief Executive Officer Patti Hart said on a
conference call. The Las Vegas-based company paid as much as
$500 million last year for Double Down Interactive, a maker of
social casino games for Facebook Inc. Customers can buy chips on
the site but can’t win actual money.  Daily active users at Double Down jumped 25 percent to 1.7
million in the quarter, from a year earlier, while revenue per
user rose 60 percent to 40 cents per day.  Mobile customers jumped 41 percent sequentially, Vandemore
said. Revenue per customer on iPads and other wireless devices
were similar to that of desktop computers.  “That’s good,” Vandemore said. “A lot of mobile
applications are monetized at a lower clip.”  International Game fell 3.1 percent to $18.30 in  New York ,
before the results. The  shares  have risen 29 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
