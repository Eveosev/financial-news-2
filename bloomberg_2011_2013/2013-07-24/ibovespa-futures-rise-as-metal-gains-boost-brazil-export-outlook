Ibovespa  futures  advanced, a sign
that  Brazil ’s equity benchmark may rise for a third day, as
concern eased that Europe’s economy is faltering, bolstering the
outlook for raw-material producers.  Embraer SA (EMBR3)  may be active after JPMorgan Chase & Co. raised
its recommendation on the plane builder to the equivalent of
hold.  Cia. Brasileira de Distribuicao Grupo Pao de Acucar ,
Brazil’s biggest retailer, may move after reporting second-quarter profit that exceeded analysts’ forecasts.  Ibovespa futures contracts expiring in August rose 0.6
percent to 49,000 at 9:26 a.m. in Sao Paulo. The real declined
0.3 percent to 2.2199 per dollar. The Bloomberg Base Metals 3-Month Price Commodity Index added 0.9 percent as a manufacturing
index based on a survey of purchasing managers in the euro area
increased to 50.1 from 48.8 in June, according to Markit
Economics. That compared with the median estimate of 49.1 among
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “Today’s readings confirm that normalization is under
way” in  Europe , Barclays Plc analyst Apolline Menut wrote in a
research note to clients.  Commodities producers account for about 38 percent of the
Ibovespa’s weighting.  Brazil’s benchmark equity gauge slumped 20 percent this
year through yesterday, wiping out $205 billion from the  value 
of Brazilian equities, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The Ibovespa trades at 12.3 times analysts’  earnings estimates 
for the next four quarters, compared with 10.5 for the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index of 21 developing nations’ equities.  Trading volume for stocks in Sao Paulo was 5.6 billion
reais yesterday, which compares with a daily average of
7.7 billion reais this year through July 22, according to data
 compiled  by the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
