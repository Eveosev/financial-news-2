Palm, the most-used cooking oil,
sank to the lowest level since 2009 as global supplies expand to
a record and demand rises at the slowest pace in more than a
decade.  Soybean oil  dropped to the lowest since 2010.  Futures fell 1.6 percent to 2,222 ringgit ($698) a metric
ton on the Bursa  Malaysia  Derivatives in  Kuala Lumpur , the
lowest close for the most-active contract since November 2009.
Prices plunged 24 percent in the past year.  World  stockpiles  of the oil used in everything from candy
to biofuel are set to surge 21 percent to a record 9.5 million
tons by the end of the 2013-2014 year, as demand expands 4.4
percent, the least in 12 years, U.S. Department of Agriculture
data show. Rising supplies of the more expensive soybean oil are
adding to the glut, with U.S. growers set to reap their biggest-ever crop starting September.  “The overall bearish sentiment which is currently in play
will only be accelerated as the production cycle increases for
 palm oil ,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, a director at
Commtrendz Risk Management Services Pvt. in Mumbai. “There are
no supportive demand factors at all.”  Palm production, accounting for 35 percent of cooking oil
supply, will expand 5 percent to 58.1 million tons in 2013-2014,
USDA data show. Output doubled over the previous decade, led by
Indonesia and Malaysia. The predicted stockpiles are equal to 17
percent of demand, the highest level since 1989, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Fifth Year  Supplies of soybean oil, the second most-consumed edible
variety, will rise to a record for a fifth year and reach 44.6
million tons, the USDA predicts. The lack of any significant hot
weather for the U.S. Midwest during the next 10 days will favor
soybeans, DTN said in a report yesterday.  Soybean oil for delivery in December fell as much as 0.4
percent to 44.51 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade,
the lowest level for the most active contract since October
2010, before trading at 44.60 cents. Soybeans for delivery in
November climbed 0.4 percent to $12.65 a bushel.  Refined palm oil for January delivery lost 1.2 percent to
close at 5,568  yuan  ($908) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , the lowest close for the most-active contract since
July 2009. Soybean oil fell 1 percent to end at 7,244 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
