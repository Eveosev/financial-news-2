HanesBrands Inc. (HBI)  agreed to buy
 Maidenform Brands Inc. (MFB)  in a transaction valued at about $575
million in cash, expanding in lingerie.  HanesBrands will pay $23.50 for each of Iselin, New Jersey-based Maidenform’s shares, the lingerie maker said in a
statement today. That’s 23 percent higher than yesterday’s
closing price.  Maidenform said the transaction is expected to close in the
fourth quarter.  HanesBrands said the purchase should boost earnings per
share in the first year after completion. After three years, it
will increase sales by more than $500 million, the underwear
maker said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
