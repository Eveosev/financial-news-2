Puma SE (PUM) , Europe’s second-largest
sporting goods maker, reported quarterly profit that declined
more than analysts estimated as sales fell in all regions.  Second-quarter earnings before interest and tax fell to 31
million euros ($40.9 million) from 47 million euros a year
earlier, the Herzogenaurach, Germany-based company said today in
a statement. Analysts predicted 36.1 million euros, according to
the average of 11  estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Puma is closing stores, eliminating jobs and cutting
product ranges to combat declining footwear sales, while seeking
to boost its performance-wear credentials. The sporting-goods
maker cut its 2013 forecasts in May, saying it expects a low-to-mid single-digit decline in currency-adjusted sales as well as
pressure on the gross profit margin during the second half. It
reiterated the guidance today.  “Southern Europe and the Far East remain challenging,”
Puma said in the statement. Revenue fell 4 percent to 692
million euros on a currency adjusted basis, trailing the 709
million-euro average of analysts estimates.  Puma still expects an increase in full-year net income
compared to 2012, it said.  Former  Pandora A/S (PNDORA)  head Bjoern Gulden started as Puma Chief
Executive Officer this month, one of a number of senior
management changes that owner  Kering SA (KER)  has made at the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
