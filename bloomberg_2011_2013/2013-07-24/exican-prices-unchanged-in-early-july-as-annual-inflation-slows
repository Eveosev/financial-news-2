Mexican  consumer prices  were
unchanged in the first two weeks of July, surprising economists
who had expected prices to rise.  The stagnation in costs slowed annual inflation to 3.53
percent, within the 2 percent to 4 percent target range and
compared with 4.09 percent in June, the national statistics
agency said today on its  website . The median estimate of 20
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was for prices to rise 0.11
percent in early July. Core prices, which exclude energy and
farm costs, climbed 0.04 percent.  Falling fresh food costs have helped inflation undershoot
analyst estimates in the past two months, leading economists to
lower their forecasts for this year. A slowing economy and a
rebound in the peso are also prompting investors to pare bets
the central bank will raise  interest rates  and begin wagering it
may reduce borrowing costs.  The peso weakened 0.6 percent to 2.5676 per dollar at 8:12
a.m. in Mexico City. The currency has strengthened 5.8 percent
in the past 30 days as the U.S. Federal Reserve damped
speculation that it will start to curb asset purchases soon. The
currency had plunged 5.3 percent in May on speculation the Fed
would dial back its stimulus.  A stronger peso brings down the cost of imports, which may
ease inflation.  The yield on inflation-linked peso bonds due in 2014 rose
one basis point to 0.20 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
