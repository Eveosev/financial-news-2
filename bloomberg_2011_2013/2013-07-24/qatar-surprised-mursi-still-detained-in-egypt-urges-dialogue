Qatar , the Arab world’s main backer
of deposed Egyptian President Mohamed Mursi, expressed
“surprise” that he remains detained and called for dialogue to
end violence between his supporters and opponents.  “The one way out of the crisis in sister Egypt is a
political solution based on dialogue,” state-run  Qatar News
Agency said  late yesterday, citing a foreign ministry official
it didn’t identify. “That cannot happen when one party in that
dialogue is absent and its symbol is detained.”  Qatar also expressed “concern” over civilian deaths in
the fighting that followed Mursi’s July 3 overthrow, according
to QNA. Dozens have died in the clashes.  Egypt’s military ousted Mursi after days of mass rallies
against his rule and has held him at an undisclosed location
since.  Qatar, a strong supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood that
fielded Mursi for office, extended  Egypt  $8 billion in aid
during his year in power. The backing set Qatar apart from
neighbors Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and  Kuwait ,
which extended $12 billion to the military-backed government
that replaced Mursi’s.  The Qatari leadership changed last month when the former
Emir Hamad Bin Khalifa Al Thani abdicated in favor his son Tamim
Bin Hamad Al Thani. The new emir appointed Sheikh Abdullah bin
Nasser bin Khalifa Al Thani as prime minister, replacing Hamad
Bin Jassim Al Thani, architect of a foreign policy that backed
the uprisings across the Arab world.  To contact the reporter on this story:
