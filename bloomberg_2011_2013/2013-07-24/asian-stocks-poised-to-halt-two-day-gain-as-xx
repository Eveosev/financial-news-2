Most  Asian stocks  fell, with the
regional benchmark index retreating from a two-month high, after
a private survey showed  China ’s manufacturing contracting at a
faster-than-estimated pace.  PetroChina Co., the country’s No. 1 energy producer, sank 2
percent in Hong Kong. Kao Corp., a maker of household and
chemical products, fell 6.2 percent in  Tokyo  after giving an
update on a  product recall . LG Innotek Co. and Inventec Corp.
led gains among Apple Inc. suppliers in  Asia  after the iPhone
and iPad maker topped analysts’ earnings projections in the
third quarter.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent to 137.07 as
of 6:23 p.m. in Hong Kong, reversing gains of as much as 0.2
percent. About five shares declined for every four that rose on
the gauge. The measure dropped 4.9 percent through yesterday
from this year’s high on May 20 amid signs China’s economic
slowdown is deepening and concern the Federal Reserve will start
tapering monetary stimulus as the  U.S. economy  improves.  “We know China is slowing, but we just don’t know who to
believe in China over whether we see sub-7 percent or 7 percent
growth,” said  Chris Weston , chief market strategist at IG
Markets Ltd. in  Melbourne . “The market globally, including
 emerging markets , has become a lot more comfortable with the
tapering exercise and it’s not going to have massive negative
ramifications for emerging markets and global equities.”  Premier  Li Keqiang  said China’s “bottom line” for gross
domestic product growth is 7 percent and the nation can’t let
growth go below that, Beijing News reported yesterday, citing
comments at a recent meeting with economists and businesspeople.
The “lower limit” for China’s GDP growth is 7.5 percent, Li
was cited as saying.  China PMI  Japan’s Topix index lost 0.2 percent, while the Nikkei 225
Stock Average slipped 0.3 percent.  Hong Kong ’s Hang Seng Index
added 0.2 percent after falling as much as 0.5 percent. China’s
Shanghai Composite declined 0.5 percent, paring a decline of 1.6
percent.  China’s manufacturing weakened further in July, signaling
the worst of the nation’s slowdown has yet to be reached,
according to a preliminary survey of  purchasing managers .  The reading of 47.7 for an index released today by HSBC
Holdings Plc and Markit Economics was less than estimated and if
confirmed in the final report on Aug. 1, would be the lowest in
11 months. Readings below 50 indicate contraction.  ’Minimum Growth’  “China’s central government already mentioned about
minimum growth,” said Masahiko Ejiri, a Tokyo-based senior  fund
manager  at Mizuho Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $34 billion. “If the economy continues to slow
down it would mean the government has to provide more stimulus
for the economy. There’s concern they may spend the stimulus in
a very inefficient way.”  PetroChina dropped 2 percent to HK$9.26. ZTE Corp., China’s
second-largest maker of equipment for phone networks, fell 3
percent to HK$13.42 after yesterday surging by the most since
2008 on a jump in first-half earnings.  Taiwan’s Taiex Index fell 0.2 percent, while Singapore’s
Straits Times Index gained 0.7 percent. Australia’s S&P/ASX 200
and New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index rose 0.4 percent.  Shares on the MSCI Asia Pacific Index traded at 13.5 times
estimated earnings as of yesterday, compared with 15.4 times for
the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 13.4 times for the Stoxx
Europe 600 Index.  U.S. Futures  Futures of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gained 0.2
percent today. The measure slid 0.2 percent in  New York 
yesterday as investors weighed corporate earnings amid
speculation on when the  Federal Reserve  may scale back its asset
purchases. The Richmond Fed’s gauge of manufacturing in the mid-Atlantic region unexpectedly fell to minus 11 in July.  Apple, maker of the iPhone and iPad, rallied after the
close of U.S. exchanges. The Cupertino, California-based company
reported earnings of $7.47 a share in the quarter ended June 29,
compared with an average analyst estimate of $7.30. Sales rose
to $35.3 billion, beating a projection of $35 billion.  LG Innotek, the South Korean camera-module supplier, surged
3.5 percent to 93,700 won in  Seoul , the highest close since June
19. The company, which today reported stronger-than-estimated
second-quarter profit, gets 3.3 percent of its revenue from
Apple, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Taiwan’s Inventec Corp., maker of Apple notebooks, surged
6.8 percent to NT$21.15.  AAC Technologies Holdings Inc. (2018) , which
gets 37  percent  of sales from the U.S. company, climbed 3.2
percent to HK$35.55 in Hong Kong.  Kao sank 6.2 percent to 3,230 yen in Tokyo after yesterday
saying 2,250 people reported the appearance of white blotches on
their skin after using its brightening products.  To contact the reporter on this story:
