The following is a roundup of soccer
stories from U.K. newspapers, with clickable Internet links.  Bale Bothered?  Tottenham is worried that Real Madrid has unsettled winger
 Gareth Bale , who may move to the Spanish club,  the Daily Mirror
said.   The north London team values the 24-year-old at 85 million
pounds ($130 million) and is concerned that Real and Manchester
United may start a bidding war should the player become
unsettled by Real’s attention, the newspaper said  Forgotten Man  West Brom is trying to bring in Manchester City winger
 Scott Sinclair , who hasn’t played much after signing for 6
million pounds last August,  the Sun said.   City have signed another winger, Jesus Navas, so Sinclair
isn’t likely to get more playing time, the newspaper said. New
Everton coach  Roberto Martinez , who worked with Sinclair at
Wigan, may also be interested, the Sun said.  Loan Ranger?  Stoke is trying to sign Queens Park Rangers forward Adel Taarabt on loan, but his club wants to make a permanent deal for
the player,  the Daily Mail said .  Taarabt was sent home from training camp, and his
relationship with manager  Harry Redknapp  is suffering, the
newspaper said.  Feud Ending?  New QPR signing Karl Henry has ended a disagreement with
fellow midfielder  Joey Barton  after joining the west London club
from Wolves,  the Mirror said.   Barton, who called Henry “a Sunday league player” and “a
mug,” and Henry, who labeled Barton “an embarrassment,” have
shaken hands and spoken, a club official told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
