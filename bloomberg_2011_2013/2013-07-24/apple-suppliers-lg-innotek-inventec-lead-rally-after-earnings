LG Innotek Co. (011070)  and  Inventec Corp. (2356) 
led gains among  Apple Inc. (AAPL)   suppliers  in Asia after the iPhone
and iPad maker topped analysts’ earnings projections in the
third quarter.  LG Innotek, the South Korean camera-module supplier, surged
3.5 percent to 93,700 won in  Seoul , the highest close since June
19. The company, which today reported stronger-than-estimated
second-quarter profit, gets 3.3 percent of its revenue from
Apple, according to  data compiled by Bloomberg .  Apple, the world’s most-valuable technology company,
reported earnings of $7.47 a share from April to June, beating
the $7.30 average estimate compiled by Bloomberg. Apple plans to
release updated versions of top-selling devices later this year
as it tries to reclaim sales ground lost to  Samsung Electronics (005930) 
Co. and Chinese makers of cheaper smartphones.  “Apple’s comments on new products and its better-than-expected profit are positive to South Korean suppliers,
especially in the second half of this year,” Eo Kyu Jin, a
Seoul-based analyst at IBK Securities Co., said by phone today.  Taiwan’s Inventec, maker of Apple notebooks, surged 6.8
percent at the close, while the benchmark  Taiex index  fell 0.2
percent.  Other Apple suppliers also climbed after the company’s
earnings release. LG Display Co., which gets 3.3 percent of its
revenue from the Cupertino, California-based company, recorded
its steepest increase in two weeks.  Icheon, South Korea-based chipmaker  SK Hynix Inc. (000660)  advanced
the most in one week, while Taiwan-based lens maker  Largan
Precision Co. (3008)  added 1.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
