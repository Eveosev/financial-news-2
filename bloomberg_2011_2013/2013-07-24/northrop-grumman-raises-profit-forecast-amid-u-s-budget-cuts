Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC) , the maker of
Global Hawk surveillance drones, raised its profit forecast as
F-35 jet work helped boost sales and profit in the second
quarter.  The company’s earnings  exceeded  analysts’ estimates. Net
income from continuing operations rose 1.7 percent in the
quarter to $488 million, or $2.05 a share, from $480 million, or
$1.88 a share, a year earlier, Northrop said today in a
statement. The average estimate of 19 analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg was $1.71 a share.  The results included a pretax charge of $30 million, or 8
cents a share, mostly related to premiums paid to redeem $850
million in debt. Sales rose less than 1 percent to $6.29
billion.  Northrop, based in  Falls Church , Virginia, said it expects
profit of $7.60 to $7.80 a share this year, compared with a
prior forecast of $6.85 to $7.15 a share. The company is the
fifth-largest U.S. government contractor.  The contractor’s aerospace revenue rose 9 percent, mostly
because of increased production of F-35 jets, according to the
statement. Northrop  subcontracts  with  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT)  on
the program, which is the Pentagon’s most expensive weapon
system.  F-35 Jets  Northrop booked $1.3 billion last year for work on the F-35
jet, according to a regulatory filing.  Sales at the company’s  Information Systems  unit dropped 9
percent in part because of “lower funding levels and contract
completions across the portfolio,” according to the statement.  Northrop has divested low-margin businesses such as
shipbuilding and has cut its workforce in anticipation of
 federal budget  cuts.  Pentagon programs are being sliced by $37 billion this
fiscal year under a process known as sequestration that began
March 1 after President  Barack Obama  and Congress failed to
reach a broader deficit-reduction agreement.  Northrop rose 1.7 percent to close at a record $90.30 in
 New York  and has advanced 34 percent this year.  Lockheed Martin Corp., the world’s largest defense
contractor, raised its full-year profit forecast yesterday as it
reported second-quarter earnings that beat analysts’ estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
