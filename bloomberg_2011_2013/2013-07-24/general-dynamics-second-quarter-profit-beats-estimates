General Dynamics Corp. (GD)  reported
second-quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as higher
Gulfstream business-jet sales helped offset declining revenue at
the unit that produces military vehicles and munitions.  Net income increased 1 percent to $640 million, or $1.81 a
share, compared with $634 million, or $1.77 a share, a year
earlier, the  Falls Church , Virginia-based company said today in
a statement. Analysts predicted $1.62 a share, the average of 18
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell less than 1 percent
to $7.91 billion.  Sales at General Dynamics’ aerospace unit, which produces
the Gulfstream jets, gained 29 percent from a year earlier on
rising deliveries, while revenue declined 28 percent at the
combat-systems division.  The company received “orders for every Gulfstream aircraft
model in second-quarter 2013, demonstrating continued demand
across its portfolio of business-jet products,” according to
the statement.  General Dynamics rose 1.5 percent to close at $85.31, the
highest price since Sept. 8, 2008. The shares have gained 23
percent this year.  The company, which makes Abrams tanks, is consolidating its
defense business into fewer units and seeking international
sales as automatic U.S. budget cuts known as sequestration are
stripping $37 billion from Pentagon programs this fiscal year.  Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT) , the world’s largest defense
contractor, raised its full-year profit forecast yesterday as it
reported second-quarter earnings that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
