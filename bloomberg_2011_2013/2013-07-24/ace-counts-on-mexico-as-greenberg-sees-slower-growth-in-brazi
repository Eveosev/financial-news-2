Evan Greenberg, the chief executive
officer of  Ace Ltd. (ACE) , said the insurer is looking beyond Latin
American’s largest economy as the company seeks growth in the
continent.  “It’s obviously slowed down a lot in Brazil,” Greenberg
said today in a conference call held by the Zurich-based
insurer. “But we’ve got Mexico, Colombia, Chile, the Andean
countries, and they’re doing quite well.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
