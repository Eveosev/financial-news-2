Brazil’s  unemployment rate  rose in
June to the highest since April 2012, signaling a weakening
labor market after five quarters of below-forecast economic
growth in  Latin America ’s biggest economy.  The jobless rate jumped to 6 percent last month from 5.8
percent in May, according to a report today on the National
Statistics agency’s website. That was higher than expected by
all but 1 of 27 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, whose median
forecast was for a 5.8 percent rate. The rate also rose from 5.9
percent the year before, the first rise in June since 2009.  Near-record low unemployment in the world’s second-largest
emerging market had helped sustain consumer demand while stoking
inflation through higher labor costs. Now, falling purchasing
power is forcing some people who had left the labor market to
return, said Jose Goncalves, chief economist at Banco Fator SA.  “It clearly reflects a softening labor market,” Goncalves
said by telephone from  Sao Paulo . “The most likely reason is
that those people who left the labor market when salaries were
rising are now coming back.”  Average annual real wage growth slowed to 0.8 percent in
June from 1.4 percent in April,  Alberto Ramos , chief Latin
America economist at Goldman Sachs, said in an e-mailed research
note today.  Swap rates  due in January 2015, the most traded in Sao
Paulo today, rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point,
to 9.31 percent at 11:53 a.m. local time. The real weakened 1
percent against the dollar to 2.2366.  Fewer Jobs  Brazil’s formal job creation in the first half of 2013 was
the weakest for the period in four years, the Labor Ministry
reported yesterday.  Quicker inflation, increased family indebtedness and a drop
in consumer and business sentiment have contributed to below-forecast economic growth for the past five quarters. Analysts in
the latest central bank survey cut their 2013 GDP growth
forecast for the 10th straight week, to 2.28 percent, and
predicted 2.6 percent expansion in 2014.  Brazil ’s economy slowed to 0.9 percent growth last year
from 2.7 percent in 2011, as manufacturers lost ground to
foreign competitors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
