Japanese  shares  fell, with the  Topix (TPX) 
index dropping from a two-month high, as shipping lines and
construction companies led losses amid the lowest trading volume
this year. Shares pared declines as the yen weakened.  Kao Corp. tumbled 6.2 percent after the household-goods
manufacturer’s cosmetics unit said 2,250 people reported white
blotches on their skin after using brightening products.
Shippers fell the most among the 33 Topix industry groups after
trade data missed estimates. Hokkaido Electric Power Co. sank
4.6 percent as the nuclear regulator said it will delay safety
checks on the utility’s reactors.  Nidec (6594)  Corp., the world’s No. 1
manufacturer of small precision motors, jumped 10 percent after
raising its profit forecast.  The Topix decreased 0.2 percent to 1,219.92 at the close of
trading in  Tokyo , after falling as much as 0.7 percent. About
eight shares dropped for every seven that rose. The Nikkei 225
Stock Average slipped 0.3 percent to 14,731.28.  “We’ve had some strong gains recently, and now we don’t
have a strong reason for the market to trade higher, investors
are wanting to take profits,” said  Naoki Fujiwara , chief  fund
manager  at Shinkin Asset Management Co., which oversees the
equivalent of $4.8 billion. “But earnings are going to be good
overall, so that should support the market.”  After plunging as much as 18 percent from a May 22 high,
the Topix rebounded amid optimism Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will
push through reforms after winning upper-house elections on July
21. Investor attention is now shifting to whether the government
will cut corporate taxes, ease regulations, loosen  labor laws ,
join the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade agreement and
raise the  sales tax  as planned.  Earnings Season  Next week is the peak of first-quarter earnings reporting
for companies on the Topix, with 688 of them  scheduled  to
announce results. Earnings per share will more than double from
the previous quarter, according to analyst  estimates  compiled by
Bloomberg. Full-year profits are projected to rise 57 percent,
the data show.  The yen weakened 0.4 percent against the dollar today,
after strengthening for the past two days. The Japanese currency
retreated against 14 of its 16 major peers.  Overseas visitors to  Japan  in the first half of this year
rose 23 percent to a record 4.95 million, the Japan National
Tourism Organization said today.  Exports increased 7.4 percent from a year earlier, the
 Finance Ministry  said in Tokyo today, compared with the 10
percent median estimate of 26 economists surveyed by  Bloomberg
News . Imports climbed 11.8 percent, also missing estimates. The
trade deficit was 180.8 billion yen ($1.8 billion), the
narrowest in a year.}  Kao Tumbles  Shippers led declines among the  Topix groups  after the
trade data, with Nippon Yusen K.K., Japan’s largest by value,
dropping 1.3 percent to 296 yen. Mitsui O.S.K. Lines Ltd., the
No. 2, slumped 1.9 percent to 413 yen, while Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha Ltd., the third biggest, fell 1.4 percent to 209 yen.  Among other shares that fell, Kao tumbled 6.2 percent to
3,230 yen, the biggest drop on the  Nikkei 225 . The company’s
cosmetics unit Kanebo Cosmetic Inc.  recalled  up to 360,000
products that include the quasi-drug “Rhododenol” after 2,250
people reported the appearance of white blotches on their skin
after use of brightening products.  Tokyo Electric Power Co., the most actively traded stock on
the first section of the Tokyo exchange today, dropped for a
sixth day to lead power producers lower. The utility known as
Tepco, which is the  second-best performing  stock in developed
markets this year, fell after saying radioactive groundwater was
flowing into the ocean from its Fukushima nuclear plant.  Safety Checks  The stock also dropped after public broadcaster NHK said
radiation decontamination efforts in Fukushima prefecture may
cost 5.13 trillion yen, more than four times the budget the
government has allocated, citing estimates by the National
Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology.  Hokkaido Electric Power Co. sank 4.6 percent to 1,422 yen,
most since June 11, as Japan’s Nuclear Regulation Authority said
it will postpone safety checks on two of three reactors the
utility applied for July 8. The utility today said it will take
comments made by the regulator into consideration and submit a
revised application for the safety assessment.  Among stocks that rose, Nidec jumped 10 percent to 8,130
yen for its biggest gain in over four years. The Kyoto-based
company raised its operating-profit forecast 7.1 percent to 75
billion yen after first-quarter profits exceeded estimates.  The Topix added 15 percent over the past five weeks, the
biggest such advance since April 2009. The 25-day Toraku Index,
which compares the numbers of advancing and declining stocks on
the gauge, reached 132.79 today, above the 130 level some
investors say signals stocks may decline.  ‘Profit Taking’  “There’s a feeling that stocks are overheating, so after
gains there’s going to be a lot of profit taking,” said
 Hiroichi Nishi , an equities manager in Tokyo at SMBC Nikko
Securities Inc., a unit of Japan’s second-biggest lender by
market value. “Still, with expectations for Abenomics and
Japan’s economic recovery, we probably won’t see big declines.
When stocks start looking cheap the buying momentum is likely to
be quite strong.”  Just 2.1 billion shares were  traded  on the first section of
the Tokyo exchange today, the lowest since Dec. 12, when 1.94
billion shares changed hands, Bloomberg data show. That’s a 73
percent fall from the May 23 peak of 7.66 billion shares, which
was the highest since April 1989.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.1 percent
today. The measure lost 0.2 percent in  New York  yesterday as
investors weighed corporate earnings amid speculation on when
the  Federal Reserve  may cut asset purchases.  The Topix traded at 1.31 times  book value  today, compared
with 2.49 for the S&P 500 and 1.69 for the Stoxx Europe 600
Index yesterday. The gauge’s 30-day historic volatility was at
25.57 today, down 41 percent from its July 2 high of 43.22.  To contact the reporters on this story:
