Commercial Bank of Qatar QSC tumbled
the most in five months after the Persian Gulf nation’s second-biggest lender boosted provisions for non-performing loans six-fold and its quarterly profit missed estimates.  The shares fell 3.4 percent, the most since Feb. 27, to
70.3 riyals at the close in Doha. Commercial Bank was the most-traded stock with the largest decline on the benchmark  QE Index (DSM) ,
which slipped 0.2 percent. Volume jumped to 3.4 times the three-month daily average, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The lender said yesterday second-quarter profit was 518
million riyals ($142 million). That compares with 545.7 million
riyals in the year-earlier period and fell short of the 527
million-riyal  mean  estimate of seven analysts on Bloomberg.
First-half net provisions for loans increased to 194 million
riyals from 32 million riyals, the bank said.  Investors were disappointed as “total non-performing loans
have increased to 1.8 billion riyals from 725 million in the
first quarter,” Doha-based Bobby Sarkar, head of research at
Qatar National Bank Financial Services, said by e-mail.  Commercial Bank said net provisions and NPLs were affected
“by a prudential provision taken on a domestic real estate
loan.” Net-interest income fell 3 percent to 914 million riyals
in the first half of the year compared with the same period in
2012, while the net-interest margin declined to 2.54 percent
from 2.64 percent, quarter-on-quarter.  Eleven analysts  recommend  investors buy Commercial Bank
shares, five say hold and one advises on selling them, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg. The stock has gained 1.4 percent
in the past 12 months, trailing an advance of 17 percent for the
QE Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
