Japanese electric-power companies
are seeking approval to raise retail rates as increased use of
liquefied natural gas drives up generation costs, a government
energy adviser said.  Some of the applications have already been approved by the
central government after factoring in the possible lower cost of
buying LNG in the future, Hiroshi Hashimoto, a senior gas
researcher at the Institute of Energy Economics,  Japan , said in
the July  report .  LNG has replaced nuclear power as Japan’s primary fuel for
power generation after the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami led
the government to shut the country’s reactors. The nation paid 6
trillion yen ($60 billion), twice as much as the year before,
for a record 87.3 million metric tons of gas imports in 2012,
according to customs data.  Eight out of 10 electric power companies besides  Hokuriku
Electric Power Co. (9505)  and  Okinawa Electric Power Co. (9511)  had 1.6
trillion yen of net losses in the fiscal year ended March, a
second annual decline, said Hashimoto. “They are severely
bitten by the burdens to run thermal power generation capacity
to replace lost nuclear power,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
