EasyJet Plc (EZJ)  boosted sales almost 11
percent to 1.14 billion pounds ($1.75 billion) in the three
months through June as Europe’s second-largest discount carrier
added capacity in the U.K.,  Switzerland  and  Italy .  Revenue per seat, reflecting average fares plus income from
ancillary charges, rose 6.1 percent to 61.44 pounds at constant
currencies, EasyJet said in a statement. Pretax profit for the
12 months to Sept. 30 will be in a 450 million pounds to 480
million pounds range, versus 317 million pounds a year earlier.  EasyJet is ramping up efforts to draw corporate flyers with
allocated seating, flexible tickets and higher frequencies on
key routes, and began fast-tracking flexi-fare clients in May.
Cuts at network carriers helped EasyJet lure 10 million business
travelers in 2012, and rivals reduced capacity on overlapping
routes by 500,000 seats in the three months, the carrier said.  “EasyJet has delivered a strong performance in the third
quarter in a benign capacity environment,” Chief Executive
Officer Carolyn McCall said in the release, adding that almost
three-quarters of the airline’s second-half seats are booked.  The company added 400,000 passengers in the period and
increased capacity 3.6 percent, with its  load factor , a measure
of seat occupancy, sliding to 88.2 percent from 89.1 percent a
year earlier as Easter fell in the previous quarter.  McCall has sought to multiply frequencies on services
attractive to business clients while adding new routes from
 London  to Moscow and between Milan and Rome Fiumicino airport.  Luton, England-based EasyJet grew U.K. capacity by about 4
percent in the three months, as well as scaling up its Swiss and
Italian operations by 13 percent and 7 percent respectively.  Plans to buy 135 Airbus SAS jets worth $13 billion at list
prices for delivery from 2015 were backed by shareholders this
month, even as founder  Stelios Haji-Ioannou  decried the deal as
bad for investors.  Dublin-based Ryanair,  Europe ’s No. 1 low-cost carrier, will
report first-quarter results July 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
