The decision to award Qatar the 2022
 World Cup  was a “blatant mistake,” Theo Zwanziger, an
executive committee member of soccer world governing body FIFA,
told German newspaper Bild.  Former German soccer federation president Zwanziger said
plans to move the Qatar event from summer to winter, when
temperatures are cooler, could damage European leagues and hurt
“the unity of German soccer” because of scheduling changes in
the Bundesliga and amateur game.  Zwanziger criticized FIFA President  Sepp Blatter ’s plan to
ask the executive committee to switch the event to the winter
after he initially said it should be held in summer, even amid
soaring temperatures.  Blatter’s change of heart “makes clear what a blatant
mistake” it was to award the World Cup to Qatar, Zwanziger told
Bild.  To contact the reporter on this story:
