Bakken crude on the  spot market 
weakened to a seven-week low relative to West Texas Intermediate
as  Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  prepared to restart a pipeline delivering to
the oil’s pricing point.  Repairs on Enbridge’s Line 81 continued this morning, and
the line is expected to return to normal service later today,
Houston-based spokeswoman Terri Larson said by e-mail. It’s the
main line on Enbridge’s Bakken system, and can deliver as much
as 210,000 barrels a day to Clearbrook,  Minnesota .  The line was shut July 22 after a 1-barrel leak was
discovered in Rugby, North Dakota.  Bakken priced in Clearbrook weakened $1 to a $5-a-barrel
discount to WTI at 12:06 p.m., the largest since June 3,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The light, sweet crude from  North Dakota  and nearby areas
also faces more competition from similar from Canada, after
Nexen Inc. returned its 58,500-barrel-a-day Long Lake upgrader
to normal operation. The company reduced rates at the plant,
which converts bitumen into synthetic crude, after Enbridge shut
Line 37, which serviced the upgrader, on June 22.  Oil companies  produce Bakken by drilling long directional
wells through shale rock, then pumping in a high-pressure
mixture of water, sand and chemicals to perforate the shale,
releasing the hydrocarbons.  Oil output  in North Dakota’s portion of the Bakken field
has grown from about 10,000 barrels a day at the start of 2007
to a record 745,400 barrels a day in May. Bakken production has
helped spur a U.S. energy renaissance that saw the country
 produce  7.56 million barrels of crude a day in the week ending
July 19, the highest level since December 1990, based on Energy
Information Administration data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
