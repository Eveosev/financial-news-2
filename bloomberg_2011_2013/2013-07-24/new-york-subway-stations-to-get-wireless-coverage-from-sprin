Sprint Corp. (S)  said it will offer
mobile-phone coverage in all of New York City’s 277 subway
stations, seeking to catch up to  AT&T Inc. (T)  and  T-Mobile US Inc. (TMUS)   The third-biggest U.S. wireless carrier will have service
in 36 stations in the Midtown and Chelsea neighborhoods by early
next year, according to a statement today. The company signed a
deal with Transit Wireless LLC for the project, it said.  AT&T and T-Mobile reached deals in 2010 to cover the subway
stops. Verizon Wireless, the nation’s largest mobile-phone
company, is the only major U.S. carrier that has yet to announce
it will do the same. The company said in April it was  finalizing 
an agreement with Transit Wireless.  Closely held Transit Wireless won approval in 2010 to
install antennas in the subway stations in a $200 million
project.  To contact the reporter on this story:
