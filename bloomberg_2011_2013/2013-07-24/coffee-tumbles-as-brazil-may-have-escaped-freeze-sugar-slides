Coffee fell in New York, reversing
gains yesterday, as growing areas in leading producer  Brazil 
have so far escaped freezing temperatures. Sugar slid.  The lowest temperature in growing regions of northeastern
Parana state has been 1 degree Celsius (34 degrees Fahrenheit),
Celso Oliveira, a meteorologist with Sao Paulo-based weather
forecaster Somar Meteorologia, said by phone earlier today. In
southwestern Sao Paulo coffee areas it fell to 3 degrees
Celsius. Temperatures may fall further as they usually reach
their lowest by 7:30 a.m. local time.  “We are waiting for final confirmation, but the early
reports are showing that there was little if any cold weather
damage,” Alex Parry, a broker at ABN Amro Markets U.K. Ltd.,
said by e-mail today, commenting on Brazilian growing areas.
“This is being reflected in the flat price.”  Arabica for delivery in September tumbled 1.4 percent to
$1.243 a pound by 5:51 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.
Prices gained 2.1 percent on July 22 and 0.6 percent yesterday.
Robusta coffee for September delivery fell 1 percent to $1,911 a
metric ton on NYSE Liffe in  London .  The state of Parana is forecast to produce 1.7 million bags
of coffee this year, while total production in Brazil is
estimated at 48.6 million bags, according to data from the
government’s crop-forecasting agency, known as Conab. Minas
Gerais, the top growing state, is set to produce 25.5 million
bags and Sao Paulo 4.3 million bags, the data showed.  Southern Minas Gerais and the Mogiana regions have escaped
cold weather, Somar’s Oliveira said. A bag of coffee usually
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Sweetener  Raw sugar for delivery in October was down 0.1 percent to
16.33 cents a pound on ICE. White sugar for October delivery was
little changed at $475.10 a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Sugar cane crushing in Brazil’s center south, the main
growing region of the world’s biggest producer, may have been 40
million to 42 million tons in the first half of July, Michael McDougall, head of the Brazil desk at Newedge in New York, said
in a report e-mailed yesterday. The amount of cane directed to
making sugar may be 42.5 percent to 43 percent, he said.  Industry group Unica will release figures at 2 p.m. Sao
Paulo time today.  Cocoa for September delivery rose 0.2 percent to 1,601
pounds ($2,457) a ton in London. Cocoa for September delivery
