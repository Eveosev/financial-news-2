The Wimbledon women’s final between
four-time champion  Serena Williams  and  Poland ’s Agnieszka
Radwanska restarted after rain stopped the match, which the
American is leading by a set.  The grounds crew came on to cover the grass shortly after
Williams won the opening set 6-1 on Centre Court at the All
England Club in London. The sixth seed raced away with the set,
leading 5-0 before the Pole held serve with an ace.  The 30-year-old American would be the oldest Wimbledon
women’s champion since  Martina Navratilova  won her ninth title
at 33 in 1990.  Radwanska, the third seed, is in her first major final and
is trying to become the first player from Poland to win a Grand
Slam. The 23-year-old had been bothered by an upper respiratory
infection, which forced her to drop out of the doubles
competition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
