German two-year note yields fell the
most this year, pushing the rate below zero, after the  European
Central Bank  cut  interest rates  and investors sought haven
assets as the region’s financial woes deepened.  Spanish 10-year bonds posted their first weekly decline
since June 15, pushing the yield to more than the 7 percent
level that prompted  Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  to seek
sovereign bailouts. Austrian, Dutch, Belgian and French two-year
yields fell to record lows. While the ECB reduced borrowing
costs, it refrained from additional steps to cap debt yields
such as buying sovereign bonds.  “If you believe that there may be further rate cuts for
the ECB and you believe the crisis is not yet solved, I think
there will continue to be strong demand for short-dated German
paper,” said Elwin de Groot, senior market economist at
Rabobank Nederland in Utrecht, the Netherlands. “We haven’t
turned the corner.”  Germany ’s two-year  note yield  fell 13 basis points this
week to minus 0.01 percent at 4:26 p.m. London time yesterday,
the biggest drop since the week through Dec. 2. It reached a
record-low minus 0.018 percent yesterday. The zero percent
securities due June 2014 gained 0.265, or 2.65 euros per 1,000-
euro ($1,230) face amount, to 100.025.  Spain ’s 10-year yield rose 62 basis points this week, the
most since the five days through June 15, to 6.95 percent. It
reached 7.04 percent yesterday, the highest since June 20.  ECB Rates  The ECB cut its main refinancing rate by 25 basis points to
a record 0.75 percent on July 5 and cut the deposit rate to zero
for the first time to revive the economy. The euro depreciated
2.9 percent this week to $1.23 and the rate at which European
banks say they see each other lending in euros for three months
dropped to an all-time low.  German bonds may extend their gains next week before a
report on July 12 that economists said will show industrial
production in the 17-nation euro area was stagnant in May after
falling 1.1 percent in April.  German government debt returned 3.1 percent this year
through July 5, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and
the European Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. Spanish
bonds lost 5.3 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
