Genii Capital founders Gerard Lopez
and Eric Lux, owners of the Lotus Formula One team, are creating
a fund to invest as much as 500 million euros ($615 million) in
European soccer, the Financial Times reported.  The investors are considering about five second-tier teams
and about 12 businesses related to the sport, the newspaper
said, citing Lopez. The fund will be managed by Mangrove Capital
Partners, the FT said.  Lopez declined to comment on which teams Mangrove will
target or the precise size of the fund, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
