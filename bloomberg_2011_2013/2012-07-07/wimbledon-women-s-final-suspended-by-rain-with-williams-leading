The Wimbledon women’s final between
four-time champion  Serena Williams  and Poland’s Agnieszka
Radwanska was suspended because of rain after the American won
opening set 6-1.  The grounds crew came on shortly to cover the grass after
Williams won the set on Centre Court at the All England Club in
London. The sixth seed raced away with the set, leading 5-0
before the Pole held serve with an ace.  The 30-year-old American would be the oldest Wimbledon
women’s champion since  Martina Navratilova  won her ninth title
at 33 in 1990.  Radwanska, the third seed, is in her first major final and
is trying to become the first player from Poland to win a Grand
Slam. The 23-year-old had been bothered by an upper respiratory
infection, which forced her to drop out of the doubles
competition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
