Ray Allen  is leaving the Boston
Celtics for the National Basketball Association champion Miami
Heat, Heat owner  Micky Arison  said.  “It’s 2:30 a.m. in London and I was just woken with great
news,” Arison wrote on his Twitter site last night. “Welcome
to the family #20!!”  Allen, who turns 37 on July 20, is accepting $3.1 million
for next season from the Heat, half of what the Celtics had
offered him, the Boston Globe reported two days ago.  Allen, who is first in career all-time 3-point goals at
2,718, can’t sign his contract until July 11. The Celtics then
have three days to counter the offer.  To contact the reporter on this story:
