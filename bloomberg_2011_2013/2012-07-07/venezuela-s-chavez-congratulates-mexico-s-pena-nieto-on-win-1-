Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
congratulated Enrique Pena Nieto for winning the July 1 Mexican
presidential contest as Andres Manuel  Lopez Obrador , who focused
his campaign on Mexico’s poor, continues to protest the result
as fraudulent.  Chavez said in an e-mailed statement today that he was
sending congratulations in accordance with the results released
by Mexico’s Federal Electoral Institute. He made no mention of
Lopez Obrador or the charges by his Democratic Revolution Party
that Pena Nieto’s Institutional Revolutionary Party bought
votes.  Chavez, who supported Lopez Obrador’s campaign in 2006,
when he lost to President  Felipe Calderon  by less than a
percentage point and protested the result and alleged fraud for
months, has focused his government on redistributing wealth in
 Venezuela . Chavez said on Venezuelan state TV last month that he
would work with whoever won the Mexican election.  A final tally that includes a recount of more than half of
the 50.3 million votes cast was completed yesterday, according
to data on the website of Mexico’s electoral institute. It
showed Pena Nieto received 38.2 percent of votes, compared with
31.6 percent for Lopez Obrador. That is little changed from the
preliminary count.  To contact the reporter on this story:
