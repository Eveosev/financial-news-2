Britain’s Bradley Wiggins took the
leader’s yellow jersey at the  Tour de France  after his teammate
Christopher Froome won today’s seventh stage.  Team Sky’s Wiggins, the bookmakers’ race favorite, finished
third in the 199-kilometer (124-mile) ride from Tomblaine to La
Plance des Belles Filles. He leads defending champion  Cadel Evans  of BMC Racing by 10 seconds, with Liquigas’s Vincenzo
Nibali six seconds further back.  Froome crossed the finish line two seconds ahead of
Australia’s Evans and Wiggins. Evans tried to pull away from the
leaders down the stretch and was caught by Froome, who went on
to earn his first tour stage victory.  “My priority was just to watch Cadel,” Wiggins said on
the event’s website. “I knew I was going to take yellow so it’s
just fantastic to do so on the day that Froome takes the king of
the mountains. It’s an incredible day.”  Switzerland’s  Fabian Cancellara  of the RadioShack Team, who
wore the yellow jersey entering the stage, finished almost two
minutes back in 20th place. He drops to 11th place overall, 1
minute, 43 seconds behind Wiggins.  The 20-stage race continues tomorrow with a 157-kilometer
ride from Belfort to Porrentury.  To contact the reporter on this story:
