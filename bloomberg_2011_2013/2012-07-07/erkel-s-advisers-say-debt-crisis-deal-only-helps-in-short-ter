Germany’s Council of Economic
Experts, which advises Chancellor  Angela Merkel , said decisions
reached by  euro-zone  leaders at a summit in Brussels in June
will only help the euro zone in the “short term.”  “The European currency union is in a systemic crisis that
threatens the survival of the common currency and the economic
stability of Germany,” the council said in a  statement  on its
website last night. Decisions made last month “can only
stabilize the situation in the euro zone in the short term.”  Euro-area leaders agreed to relax conditions on emergency
loans for Spanish banks and possible help for Italy. Chiefs of
the 17 euro countries dropped the requirement that taxpayers get
preferred creditor status on aid to  Spain ’s blighted banks. They
also opened the way to recapitalizing lenders directly with
bailout funds once Europe sets up a single banking supervisor.  The advisers want help for Spain’s banks to be tied to
“clear criteria for recapitalization and restructuring,”
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
