Manchester City  will make a 15
million pound ($23 million) bid for Arsenal striker Robin  van
Persie , the Sun reported.  Barcelona and Paris Saint-Germain are also in the race for
the Dutchman, with Manchester United and Juventus monitoring the
situation, the Sun said. City will not pay more than 20 million
pounds as Van Persie is 28 and injury-prone, the newspaper said.  Van Persie, who led the Premier League with 30 goals last
season, said three days ago he wonâ€™t extend his Arsenal contract
when it expires after next season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
