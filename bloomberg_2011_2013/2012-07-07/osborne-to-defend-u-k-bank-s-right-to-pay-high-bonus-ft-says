Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  will argue British banks should have the right to pay
large bonuses when he attends a meeting of European finance
ministers next week, the Financial Times reported.  Osborne will argue against a draft European Union proposal
for a one-to-one bonus-to-salary ratio at a July 10 meeting, the
newspaper said, citing unidentified Treasury officials. Britain
is in the minority in its opposition to the cap, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
