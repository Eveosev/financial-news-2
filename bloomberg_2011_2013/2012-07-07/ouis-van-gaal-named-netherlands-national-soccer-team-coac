Louis  van Gaal  was named coach of the
Netherlands national soccer team for a second time, replacing
 Bert van Marwijk  after the country’s failure at the European
Championship.  Van Gaal, 60, signed a contract through the 2014 World Cup
in Brazil, the Dutch soccer federation said on its  website  last
night. He’ll begin the new post Aug. 1.  Van Marwijk ’s contract was to expire after Euro 2016, but
he quit June 27 after talks with federation officials. Entering
Euro 2012 as one of the favorites, the Netherlands lost to
Denmark, Portugal and German and failed to advance from the
group stage.  “I’m happy that the soccer federation approached me,” Van
Gaal said in a statement. “This is the challenge I’ve been
waiting for.”  Van Gaal was named Holland coach in 2000 and resigned in
early 2002 after failing to qualify for that year’s World Cup.  At club level, he won the  Champions League , three Dutch
league titles and the UEFA Cup in a six-year spell at Ajax.
He also captured league championships at Barcelona, AZ Alkmaar
and Bayern Munich, his last managerial post before being fired
in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
