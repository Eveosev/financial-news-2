Allianz SE (ALV)  Chief Executive Officer
Michael Diekmann said a return to the deutsche mark would cause
“a deep recession” in  Germany ,  Welt am Sonntag  reported in a
preview of an article that will run tomorrow.  Gross domestic product may fall 25 percent in four to five
years if Germany leaves the euro and returns to using the
deutsche mark, the CEO of the insurer said, according to the
