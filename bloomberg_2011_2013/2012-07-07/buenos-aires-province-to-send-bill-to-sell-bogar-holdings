Argentina ’s Buenos Aires province
will send a bill to Congress to allow the local government to
sell part of its holdings of inflation-linked peso bonds, known
as Bogars, as it seeks to pay employees their midyear bonuses,
Governor Daniel Scioli said.  “We are looking to access liquidity to pay” the bonuses
as soon as possible, Scioli said in a televised press conference
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
