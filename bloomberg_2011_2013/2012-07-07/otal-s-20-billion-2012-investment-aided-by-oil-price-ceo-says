Total SA (FP) ’s plan to invest $20 billion
this year and more in 2013 will be aided by  oil prices  at about
$100 a barrel, said Chief Executive Officer Christophe de Margerie.     The current price of oil is “good for long-term
investment, for long-term vision of what we need to develop,”
the executive told reporters today at a conference in Aix-en-
Provence,  France .  In February, the Paris-based company said its net
investment this year will be down from $22 billion in 2011. It
also said it will increase funds set aside for “ambitious”
exploration by 20 percent. Total’s plan to stick with its
investment project comes even as the company faces taxes at home
on its oil stocks.  French President  Francois Hollande  last week unveiled new
taxes, including one on oil stocks, seeking to meet his pledge
to narrow the country’s budget gap. The new tax on oil stocks
will cost Total about 150 million euros ($185 million), de
Margerie said.  The tax won’t help refineries that are already losing
money, he said.  “It’s hurting the (refining) industry which is already
weak” and “already losing money,” he said. “If you charge it
again, it will not help.”  The 550 million euros the French government expects to
collect from the tax will affect not only Total but other
companies such as Ineos, Lyondell, independent distributors and
large retailers, he said.  Separately, he said Total’s talks on the Stockman project
in  Russia  are “well advanced,” he said.  “I’m waiting a feedback from Gazprom,” he said, adding
that Total is still seeking a 25 percent piece of the project.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
