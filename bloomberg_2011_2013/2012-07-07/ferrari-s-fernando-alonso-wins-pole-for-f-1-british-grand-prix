Ferrari’s  Fernando Alonso  topped
qualifying for tomorrow’s British Grand Prix to claim his first
pole position in almost two years.  Alonso beat Red Bull’s  Mark Webber  by 0.47 seconds in a
rain-plagued qualifying session at the Silverstone Circuit in
Northamptonshire, England. The Spaniard, who leads the season
drivers’ standings, last started from the pole at the Singapore
Grand Prix in September 2010  Michael Schumacher of Mercedes will start third next to
two-time defending world champion Sebastian Vettel of Red Bull.
Schumacher finished third at the European Grand Prix two weeks
ago for his first podium since returning to F-1 in 2010 after a
three-year absence.  Ferrari’s Felipe Massa, Lotus’s Kimi Raikkonen, Williams’s
Pastor Maldonado, McLaren’s  Lewis Hamilton , Force India’s Nico
Hulkenburg and Lotus’s Romain Grosjean round out the top-10
qualifiers.  Alonso, who became the season’s first two-time winner at
the European Grand Prix, leads the drivers’ standings with 11
points after seven of 20 races. Webber is second with 91 points
and Hamilton third with 88.  To contact the reporter on this story:
