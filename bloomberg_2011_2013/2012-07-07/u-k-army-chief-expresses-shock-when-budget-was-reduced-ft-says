U.K. General Peter Wall said that
while the government’s decision this week to cut its army to the
lowest level since the Napoleonic wars was a shock, he is
confident the force will meet modern challenges, the Financial
Times reported.  The military will do more to train foreign armies to
improve the management of their own country’s security,
providing more support to civil authorities and reducing the
focus on long campaigns, the newspaper said, citing an interview
with Wall.  One of the issues that needs be handled carefully is the
compulsory redundancies of as much as 10 percent of the army,
Wall, the chief of the General Staff, told the FT.  Wall also wants significant spending from the government
this year on new barracks and facilities to house the 20,000
troops returning from  Germany , the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
