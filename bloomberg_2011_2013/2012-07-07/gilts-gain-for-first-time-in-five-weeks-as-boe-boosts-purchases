U.K. government bonds rose, snapping
a four-week decline, as the  Bank of England  voted to expand its
asset-purchase program by 50 billion pounds ($77.6 billion) to
help contain borrowing costs.  Ten-year yields  dropped to the lowest in a month as signs
the  European debt crisis  is worsening boosted demand for the
relative safety of U.K. securities. Ten-year gilts outperformed
30-year debt as the central bank left its purchase categories
unchanged from its previous round of buying. The pound climbed
to the strongest since 2008 against the euro after the  European
Central Bank  refrained from committing to help bring down bond
yields in Spain and  Italy .  “Ongoing concerns around  Europe  will keep the bid to core
products including gilts,” said Eric Wand, a fixed-income
strategist at Lloyds Banking Group Plc in  London . “The fact the
BOE didn’t target the longer-end of curve within their buybacks
and stuck with the original buckets has caused the longer-end to
underperform.”  The 10-year gilt yield dropped 14 basis points, or 0.14
percentage point, this week to 1.6 percent at 5 p.m. London time
yesterday. The 4 percent bond due March 2022 rose 1.365, or
13.65 pounds per 1,000-pound face amount, to 121.48. The yield
dropped to 1.59 percent yesterday, the lowest since June 8.  The 30-year rate declined three basis points to 3 percent.
The difference in yield, or  spread , between 10- and 30-year
gilts expanded 11 basis points over the week to 142 basis
points, the widest level since June 18.  Additional QE  The Bank of England’s decision to raise its  quantitative-
easing target  to 375 billion pounds on July 5 was forecast by 31
of 40 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. Seven predicted an
increase to 400 billion pounds. The central bank reduced the
amount it will buy in each tender and lengthened the program to
four months from the three taken in the previous round.  The ECB cut its main  interest rate  on the same day to a
record 0.75 percent and reduced the deposit rate to zero.
President  Mario Draghi  said there was “no discussion of further
unconventional measures” to help cap borrowing costs in nations
such as Spain and Italy.  The pound rose 1.6 percent this week to 79.33 pence per
euro after climbing to 79.27 pence yesterday, the strongest
level since November 2008. Sterling fell 1.5 percent to $1.5478.  Gilts returned 2.3 percent this year, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bonds gained 3.1 percent, and U.S.
Treasuries rose 2 percent.  The U.K. plans to auction 900 million pounds of inflation-
linked bonds due in 2050 on July 10, and 3.5 billion pounds of
10-year bonds on July 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
