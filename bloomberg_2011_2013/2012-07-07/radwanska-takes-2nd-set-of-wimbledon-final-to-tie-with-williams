Third-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of
Poland won the second set of her Wimbledon final with four-time
champion  Serena Williams  to tie the match.  Radwanska took the set 7-5 after rain stopped the match
after the opening set, which the American took 6-1 on Centre
Court at the All England Club in London.  The 30-year-old American would be the oldest Wimbledon
womenâ€™s champion since  Martina Navratilova  won her ninth title
at 33 in 1990.  Radwanska is in her first major final and is trying to
become the first player from Poland to win a Grand Slam. The 23-
year-old had been bothered by an upper respiratory infection,
which forced her to drop out of the doubles competition.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
