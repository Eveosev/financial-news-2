Belgian Energy Minister Melchior
Wathelet ignored advice from his ministry to close GDF Suez SA’s
Tihange 1 nuclear power plant as soon as 2017,  De Morgen 
 reported  today.  Wathelet overruled a proposal to close Belgium’s three
oldest reactors within five years and instead chose to shut down
Tihange in 2025, De Morgen said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
