Stefan Loefven, leader of  Sweden â€™s
biggest opposition party, the Social Democrats, said the country
should spend more to help small and medium-sized businesses
creating jobs.  The Social Democrats want to give the Swedish Trade Council
an extra 100 million kronor ($14 million) over four years to
help companies improve their exports, Loefven wrote in an
opinion piece published today by Stockholm-based newspaper
