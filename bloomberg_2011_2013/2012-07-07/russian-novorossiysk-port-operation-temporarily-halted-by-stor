Operations at the Russian Black Sea
port of Novorossiysk were interrupted by flooding during a
storm, OAO Novorossiysk Commercial Sea Port said in an e-mailed
statement.  Electrical power equipment was flooded and the portâ€™s
administration decided to shut port areas at about 1 a.m. today,
the company said in statement. The port probably can resume
operations in several hours, the company said.  Igor Demin, a spokesman for OAO Transneft, said the company
halted shipping to the Novorossiysk terminal until weather
conditions improve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
