Belgium ’s federal government must
find an extra 78 million euros ($96 million) for this year’s
budget,  La Libre  reported, citing an interview with Budget
Minister Olivier Chastel.  Belgium’s budget deficit is at 2.9 percent of gross
domestic product, instead of the planned 2.8 percent, Chastel
said. Any new spending must be compensated by savings, he said,
according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
