Brazil â€™s government plans to
introduce two measures to cut power prices as it seeks to spur
investment by the industry, Folha de S.Paulo reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  The first will reduce at least two taxes paid by
distributors that will permit them to sell at lower rates, the
Sao Paulo-based newspaper said today. The second will allow
operators of distribution, transmission and generation assets to
renew concessions that expire by 2015 at lower prices.  The measures are expected to be submitted to President
Dilma Rousseff next week and sent for approval by Congress
before June 17 when it goes into recess, according to the
newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
