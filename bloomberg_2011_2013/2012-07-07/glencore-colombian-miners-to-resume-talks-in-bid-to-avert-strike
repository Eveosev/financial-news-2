Workers at  Glencore International
Plc’s (GLEN)  Prodeco Group said they will resume negotiations next week
in a bid to avert a strike over wages and benefits.  Workers at the La Jagua coal mine in the northern Colombian
province of Cesar completed a two-day vote today authorizing a
strike, said Estevenson Avila, vice president of a workers’
group known as Funtraenergetica, in a telephone interview. Union
negotiators want further talks before setting a date for a
walkout that would halt coal production at the mine, according
to Avila.  “As long as we’re sitting at the negotiation table, we
won’t go on strike,” Avila said.  A Prodeco spokeswoman declined to comment today. On July 3,
Prodeco’s Carbones de la Jagua SA unit said the union’s demands
are “exaggerated and removed from reality” and management has
made a “fair and balanced” proposal.  La Jagua and the nearby Calenturitas mine can produce 14.5
million metric tons annually, which will be expanded to 20
million tons next year, according to Glencore’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
