The increasing risk of a euro area
recession heightens the need for the region’s governments to
move quickly to implement last week’s agreement to unify
regional bank regulation and give support to Spanish banks,
Standard & Poor’s chief European economist said.  Deleveraging is “pushing towards recession and stagnation
and the risk of a double dip has increased,” S&P’s Jean-Michel
Six said in an interview in Aix-en-Provence,  France . “Most
economies are either in recession again -- such as Spain and
 Italy  -- or very close to recession -- such as France and even
 Germany .”  To counter the slowdown, European governments should move
as quickly as possible to implement an agreement by European
leaders to counter the debt crisis, he said. “Execution is
key,” Six said. The agreement “provides breathing space, let’s
use it. We don’t have a lot of time, we have to act.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
