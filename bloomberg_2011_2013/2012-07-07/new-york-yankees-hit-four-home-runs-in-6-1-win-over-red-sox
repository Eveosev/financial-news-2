The New York Yankees twice hit back-
to-back home runs to beat the Boston Red Sox 6-1 in the opening
game of a day-night doubleheader.  Andruw Jones  hit two homers and  Nick Swisher  and Jayson Nix
had one each for New York, which has won the first two in the
four-game series at Fenway Park in Boston.  The Yankees scored four times in the top of the first
inning against Franklin Morales when Swisher hit a 3-run homer
and Jones followed with a solo shot. Jones and Nix then made it
6-0 with consecutive homers leading off the fourth.  Mauro Gomez drove in the only run for the Red Sox in the
bottom of the fourth with a single.  New York starter  Freddy Garcia  (3-2) allowed one run in 6
2/3 innings for the win, while Morales (1-2) took the loss after
giving up six runs in 3 1/3 innings.  The Yankees increased their lead over Baltimore in the
American League Eastern Division to six games as Boston dropped
9 1/2 games back in fourth place.  Phil Hughes  will start tonight’s second game for New York
against Boston’s Felix Doubront.  To contact the reporter on this story:
