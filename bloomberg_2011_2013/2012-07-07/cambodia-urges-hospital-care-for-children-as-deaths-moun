Cambodia  urged parents to seek
hospital care for children showing symptoms of unusual diseases
and to follow good hygiene, as the government and the  World
Health Organization  investigate a rash of child deaths in the
Southeast Asian nation.  Preliminary findings identified 57 children exhibiting
similar fever, respiratory and neurological symptoms, 56 of whom
died, according to a statement issued yesterday by WHO and
Cambodia.  “The investigation is ongoing and we are looking at
detailed information from the hospital records and analyzing
each and every case,” Ly Sovann, deputy director of Cambodia’s
Communicable Disease Control Department, said in the statement.
“We hope to have a better picture in the coming days.”  Samples from some patients were found negative for H5Nl and
other influenza viruses including SARS and Nipah at Institut
Pasteur du Cambodge, according to the statement. Most of the
children were younger than three years old, came from southern
and central Cambodia, and received treatment at Kantha Bopha
Children’s Hospital in the capital,  Phnom Penh . Autopsies
haven’t been performed on any of the cases, Nima Asgari, leader
of WHO’s emerging disease surveillance and response team in
Cambodia, said yesterday.  The cause of the deaths may be the result of a combination
of diseases, according to Joy Rivaca Caminade, a technical
officer with WHO’s Regional Office for the Western Pacific in
 Manila . Surveillance in the Southeast Asian nation hasn’t picked
up anything of this scale in recent years, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
