England limited Australia to 200-9 in their fourth one-day
cricket international in Durham.  Finn finished 4-37 after England won the toss and elected
to field at Chester-le-Street.  James Anderson  and Tim Bresnan
claimed two wickets each, while David Hussey top-scored for
Australia with 70.  England can clinch the five-game series with a victory
today. It won the first two games before the third was rained
out three days ago without a ball being bowled.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
