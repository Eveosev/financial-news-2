Webb Simpson  takes a two-stroke lead
over Troy Kelly into the final round of the PGA Tour’s
Greenbrier Classic.  Simpson, who fired a 5-under-par 70 yesterday, finished the
first 54 holes at 14-under 196, followed by Kelly, who shot an
8-under 62 for 198 at Old White TPC Course at The Greenbrier in
White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia.  The field is playing the weekend rounds without  Tiger Woods 
or  Phil Mickelson , both of whom missed the cut.  “When he’s not lurking around on Saturdays and Sundays, it
makes it a little easier I think for other guys,” Simpson said,
referring to Woods.  Ken Duke, J.B. Homes and Charlie Beljan share third place
with an 11-under 199 and Ted Potter Jr. follows one stroke back.  Kelly has returned to tournament play following hip-
replacement surgery in September 2010.  “For me to just play this game at a high level, I had to
go get it done,” Kelly said.  Woods and Mickelson both missed the two-round cut for the
first time together in the same tournament.  To contact the reporter on this story:
