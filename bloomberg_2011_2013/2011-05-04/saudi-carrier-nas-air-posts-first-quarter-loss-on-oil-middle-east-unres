NAS Air, a Saudi Arabian low-cost
carrier, incurred a loss in the first quarter due to higher  oil
prices  and escalating Middle East unrest, the Riyadh-based
company said in a statement e-mailed yesterday.  Oil prices rose 25 percent compared with last year and the
number of passengers using flights to destinations in troubled
Arab countries dropped, the statement said, citing Suleiman Al
Hamdan, Chief Executive Officer of National Air Services, NAS
Air’s parent company, which is 37 percent owned by  Kingdom
Holding Co. (KINGDOM)   NAS Air’s accumulated losses may cause its closure, or a
halt to its operations, or a cut of as many as 1,000 jobs, which
may exacerbate Saudi Arabia’s air transport difficulties, the
statement cited Hamdan as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
