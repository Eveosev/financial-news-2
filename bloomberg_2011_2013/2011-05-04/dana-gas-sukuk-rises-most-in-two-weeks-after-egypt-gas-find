Dana Gas PJSC (DANA) ’s Islamic bond rose the
most in more than two weeks after the United Arab Emirates-
based energy producer discovered natural gas in  Egypt ’s Nile
Delta region.  The yield on the 7.5 percent sukuk maturing in October 2012
fell 64 basis points today, or 0.64 percentage point, to 13.3
percent as of 6:13 p.m. in Dubai.  The reservoir, called the El Wastani formation, may hold
more than 60 billion cubic feet of gas reserves, Dana Gas said
in a statement yesterday, citing preliminary estimates. The
previously discovered Abu Madi Formation may hold as much as 90
million cubic feet of gas reserves, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
