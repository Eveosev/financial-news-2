The European Commission said  Italy ’s
border controls show “serious flaws,”  Bild  reported, citing an
internal commission paper.  The commission checked the border-control information
system early in April and concluded that it lags behind the
usual standards of the so-called Schengen agreement, which
abolished passport checks in most of the community, the
newspaper  said .  To contact the reporter on this story:
