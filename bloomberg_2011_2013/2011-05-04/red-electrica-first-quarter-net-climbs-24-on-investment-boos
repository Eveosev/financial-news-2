Red Electrica Corp. SA, the manager of
 Spain ’s electricity network, increased first-quarter profit 24
percent after investing in the grid and operating more assets.  Net income rose to 129.5 million euros ($191.8 million)
from 104.6 million euros in the year-earlier period, the Madrid-
based company said today in a  filing . Investment surged 47
percent to 158.2 million euros.  The utility, the third-best performer this year on the
Bloomberg Europe 500 Electric Index after  Italy ’s Enel SpA and
Prysmian SpA, earns a fixed return on investments to run and
maintain the high-voltage grid. Power demand revived after a 4.6
percent slump in Spain in 2009, and Red Electrica has estimated
demand will increase about 2 percent a year in the medium term.  The stock has gained about 22 percent in 2011, compared
with the 4.6 percent return by the 23-member index, whose worst
performer is German power company RWE AG, down 12 percent.  Earnings also benefited from the company’s acquisition of
distribution assets from Endesa SA, Gas Natural SDG SA’s Union
Fenosa unit and EDP-Energias de Portugal SA’s Hidrocantabrico
arm that weren’t contributing in the year-earlier period.  Red Electrica’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization rose 31 percent to 308 million euros in the
quarter. In February the company said it aims to report annual
growth in earnings per share of more than 12 percent in the
medium term and announced plans to invest 4 billion euros
through 2015 as it extends and upgrades the distribution grid.  To contact the reporters on this story:
