South African yellow-corn exports
almost quadrupled to a 14-year high as traders found new markets
for a surplus of the grain after farmers reaped a  bumper crop .  Outbound  shipments  jumped to 1.02 million metric tons in
the year ended April 30 from 261,608 tons in the prior period,
data posted on the South African Grain Information Service’s
website today showed. That’s the most since the 1996-97 season,
when exports came to 1.13 million tons, General Manager Anna
Enslin said by phone from  Pretoria . Exports of white corn fell.  Farmers reaped 12.82 million tons of white and yellow corn
combined, the most since 1982, on better-than-expected yields,
weighing on prices. Traders sold South African yellow corn to
nations from  Japan  to  Spain  as nearby countries that were
traditional export markets also had bumper crops of maize, as
the grain is sometimes called.  “The signal is that the market likes our maize and that it
prefers yellow corn,” Jannie  de Villiers , chief executive
officer of Bothaville, South Africa-based Grain SA, the
country’s biggest farming body, said by phone from Pretoria.
Local farmers, who grow more white corn than yellow, are
increasing plantings of the yellow variety, he said.  White corn is used to make a meal that’s the staple food
for many  South Africans , while yellow corn is mainly fed to
animals in the country. White corn fell 21 percent in
Johannesburg trading in 2010 and yellow corn declined 12
percent.  Kuwait,  Portugal   South Africa shipped 610,721 tons of yellow corn to Korea
during the year and 97,880 tons to Japan. It also sold the grain
to Kuwait, Portugal, Spain and Taiwan. Outbound shipments of
white corn dropped 25 percent to 1.05 million tons. Combined
exports of both varieties climbed 24 percent to 2.07 million
tons.  South Africa  may be in a “tight spot” if exports maintain
their pace in the current year, De Villiers said. This season’s
crop probably will fall 15 percent to 10.88 million tons,
according to the government’s Crop Estimates Committee. Late
rain has hampered access to fields, De Villiers said.  White corn for July delivery, the most active contract on
the South African Futures Exchange, fell 25 rand, or 1.5
percent, to 1,645 rand ($248) a ton by the noon close in
Johannesburg today. July-delivery yellow corn dropped 20 rand,
or 1.2 percent, to 1,700 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
