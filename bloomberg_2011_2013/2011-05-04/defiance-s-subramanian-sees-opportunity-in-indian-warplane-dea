Subu D. Subramanian, chief executive
officer of  Defiance Technologies Ltd. , comments on opportunities
that will arise from  India ’s proposed order for 126 fighter-jet
aircraft. Subramanian made the comments in a phone interview.  India last week shortlisted warplanes from  France ’s
 Dassault Aviation SA (AM)  and the European Aeronautic, Defence &
Space Co. for its medium multi-role combat aircraft program,
according to reports. The winner of the $11 billion order has to
source 50 percent worth components and services from a local
partner, according to India’s defense procurement policy.  Defiance is looking to buy a technology company in  Europe 
to tap a $5 billion opportunity from the fighter-jet deal,
Subramanian said.  “We see major share and growth coming from Europe. I hope
the medium multi-role combat aircraft announcement is going to
accelerate it. We have already positioned ourselves and that’s
why most of our incremental investments have been done in
Europe. Call it intuition or luck, Europe’s where our focus has
been.  “There’s going to be a huge offset obligation under which
whoever wins the contract has to do 50 percent worth of the
contract work out of India.  “The only challenge for the winning company is to find
someone who provides the comfort and local connection. That is
where Defiance is well-positioned.  “We may do an acquisition in Europe. We are looking for
capability that aligns with our vision and strategy. We will be
flexible on investments.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
