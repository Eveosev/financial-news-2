Air France-KLM (AF)  Group’s Japan traffic
has fallen by about a fifth following the country’s March 11
earthquake, the airline’s French sales director said today.  “Japan traffic has declined by something to the order of
20 percent,” Christian Boireau said in an interview in Paris.  Europe ’s biggest airline is focused on rebuilding traffic
on Asian and African routes after cutting capacity during the
2008-2009 economic crisis, Boireau said. The Paris-based company
indefinitely postponed plans to begin flights to Tripoli on
March 29 and remains “cautious about the Middle East.”  The carrier has removed one of its five Airbus A380
superjumbos from Tokyo routes until September in response to the
traffic decline. Air France is preparing to take delivery of a
sixth superjumbo and introduce the 538-seater on San Francisco
flights for the summer season starting June 6, until the plane
returns to  Tokyo  in September, spokesman Nicolas Petteau said.  At a Paris news conference today, the airline unveiled
mobile-phone applications and services allowing passengers to
manage reservations and receive real-time updates on flight
schedules by text message and e-mail. Air France is scheduled to
publish earnings May 19 for its fiscal year ended March 31.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
