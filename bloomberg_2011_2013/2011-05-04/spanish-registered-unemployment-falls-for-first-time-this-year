Spain ’s registered unemployment
declined for the first time in four months in April as the
Easter holiday spurred seasonal jobs.  The number of people registering for jobless benefits in
Spain fell by 64,309, or 1.5 percent, from March to 4.27
million, the  Labor Ministry  in Madrid said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Spain’s unemployment rate stood at 21 percent at the end of
March, the highest in  Europe  and three times as high as the rate
in  Germany . Deputy Prime Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said
on April 29 that the jobless rate has probably peaked and
employment data will improve in the coming months, which
coincide with the start of Spain’s tourist season.  The doubling of the  unemployment rate  since the collapse of
the decade-long property boom and the deepest budget cuts in at
least three decades have eroded support for Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who said on April 2 that he won’t run
for a third term in elections scheduled for 2012.  If elections were held now, Spain’s opposition People’s
Party would win 43.8 percent of the vote, compared with 33.4
percent for the ruling party, according to a poll by the state-
run Center for Sociological Research published on April 29.  To contact the reporter on this story:
