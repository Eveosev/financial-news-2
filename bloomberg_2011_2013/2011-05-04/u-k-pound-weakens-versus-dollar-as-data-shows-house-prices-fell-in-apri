The pound fell to the lowest in more
than a year versus the euro after reports showed U.K.  house
prices  fell in April while construction growth slowed, boosting
bets the Bank of England will keep rates at a record low.  Sterling traded near its lowest level since at least 1975
against a basket of its nine most-traded peers. House prices
fell 0.2 percent in April, the first decline in three months. A
construction gauge unexpectedly dropped to a four-month low.
Gilts declined, pushing the 10-year yield up from near a four-
month low.  “The pound is looking somewhat lackluster against the
euro, mainly on perceptions of widening rate differentials,”
said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho
Corporate Bank Ltd. in London. “Continually disappointing U.K.
data will create more sympathy amongst monetary policy committee
members to keep rates lower for longer to help the economy.”  The pound depreciated 0.4 percent to 90.29 pence per euro,
its weakest level since March 29, 2010, before trading at 89.91
pence. Sterling climbed 0.3 percent to $1.6539.  Worsening economic data may ease pressure on the  Bank of
England  to raise rates to curb inflation, which has soared to
more than twice the central bank’s 2 percent target. Policy
makers will keep the key rate at 0.5 percent when they announce
their next decision tomorrow, according to a Bloomberg survey.  Gilts Fall  U.K. government bonds declined, with the yield on the 10-
year gilt three basis point higher at 3.45 percent. The yield
earlier dropped to 3.415 percent, within half a basis point of
yesterday’s low of 3.41 percent which was the least since Jan.
4. The yield on the two-year note due March 2013 was also three
basis points higher, at 1.05 percent.  The average cost of a British home dropped 0.2 percent from
March to 165,609 pounds ($273,000),  Nationwide Building Society 
said, compared with a gain of 0.1 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 14 economists. That’s the first decrease
since January.  A gauge of building activity based on a survey of
purchasing managers fell to 53.3 in April, from 56.4 the
previous month, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said. That was below the 55.9
estimate in a Bloomberg survey and the lowest since December.  “Rate hike expectations are being pushed back and that’s
weighing on sterling,” said  Stephen Gallo , head of market
analysis at Schneider Foreign Exchange in London.  Short-sterling futures fell, lifting the implied yield on
the contract expiring March 2012 by one basis point to 1.26
percent, as investors added to bets for interest-rate increases
next year.  The U.K.’s benchmark rate compares with 1.25 percent in the
euro region, boosting the yield allure of the shared European
currency against its British counterpart. The  European Central
Bank  raised its main rate by a quarter point last month and left
the door open for further increases to curb inflation, which is
accelerating at the fastest pace in 2 1/2 years.  A measure of the pound against its nine most traded peers
fell to 60.70 as measured by Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes. That’s near the 60.63 level reached yesterday,
which was the lowest since records began in 1975.  Rate Prospects  Separate data this morning showed U.K. mortgage approvals
were little changed in March as a squeeze on incomes weighed on
the housing market. Lenders granted 47,557 home loans, up from a
revised 46,708 in February, the Bank of England said. The median
forecast of 11 economists in a Bloomberg survey was for an
increase to 48,000 from an initially reported 47,000. Net
mortgage lending rose 400 million pounds in March, half the
average over the previous six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
