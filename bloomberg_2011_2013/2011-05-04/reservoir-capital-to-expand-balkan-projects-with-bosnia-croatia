Renewable Energy Ventures d.o.o., a
Serbian unit of Vancouver-based  Reservoir Capital Corp. (REO) , plans
to build several hydro plants in Bosnia-Herzegovina and in
Croatia, along with its current projects in  Serbia .  The energy developer plans three hydro plants on the
Cehotina river in Bosnia-Herzegovina for a combined 17.5
megawatt capacity at an estimated cost of 40 million euros
($59.6 million), Deputy Director Milan Cusic said. The projects
in Croatia will involve both hydro and geothermal sources and
can be executed along with REV’s original, 140 million-euro
project for two hydro plants of 58 megawatts on the Lim river in
southwestern Serbia.  “The location in Bosnia is excellent, it has great
potential” and the planned plants can produce 88 gigawatt hours
a year, Cusic said in an interview today in Belgrade. “We are
no longer focused only on Serbia.”  Plans for  Croatia  are in an early stage of development,
while the Brodarevo 1 and Brodarevo 2 plants in Serbia remain on
schedule for completion in 2014 and 2015 respectively, even
after recent difficulties in buying land needed for their
construction from local owners, Cusic said.  The company has spent 7.5 million euros on exploration and
licenses in Serbia and “we’re totally within budget,” said
Development Director Predrag Lukic.  Securing power purchasing agreements for future output is
planned for a later stage of the projects, Cusic said, citing
expectations that electricity prices will rise.  “Why sell cheap now when we can get a better price
later?” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
