Wema Bank Plc (WEMABANK) , a Nigerian lender, rose
the most in a month after it reported a return to full-year
profit in 2010.  The stock gained 6 kobo, or 4.9 percent, its biggest
intraday increase since April 5, to 1.29 naira by 11:50 a.m. in

naira ($113.9 million), compared with a loss of 7.53 billion
naira a year earlier, the bank said in a statement on the
website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange  yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
