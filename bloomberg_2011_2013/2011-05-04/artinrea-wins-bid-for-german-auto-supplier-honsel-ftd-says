Canadian engineering company  Martinrea
International Inc. (MRE)  won a bid to buy insolvent German auto-
industry supplier Honsel AG,  Financial Times Deutschland 
reported, citing a group of creditors linked to the supplier.  Vaughan, Ontario-based Martinrea made its bid with partner
Anchorage Capital Partners Ltd., offering about 107 million
euros ($159 million) for the company, or 7 million euros more
than its closest rival, the newspaper said.  Martinrea will control Honsel’s operations and hold
“somewhat more than” 50 percent of the company’s shares, FTD
said. Honsel employs 4,000 and specializes in light-metal motor
blocks, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
