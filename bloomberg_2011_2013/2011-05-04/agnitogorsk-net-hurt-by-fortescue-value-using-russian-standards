OAO Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel, owned
by Russian billionaire Victor Rashnikov, reported first-quarter
profit fell 51 percent after revaluing investments in local and
foreign companies that include  Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG)   Net income slid to 4.5 billion rubles ($165 million), from
9.3 billion rubles in the previous three months, using Russian
accounting standards, Magnitogorsk said in a  statement  on its
website today. Its largest foreign investment is 5.4 percent of
Fortescue Metals, which has dropped 6.9 percent this year to
A$6.09. The steelmakerâ€™s press-office declined to give further
details of its figures when contacted by Bloomberg.  Magnitogorsk is seeking to sell Eurobonds this year that
may be convertible into Fortescue shares, two bankers with
knowledge of the plan said on April 28.  To contact the reporters on this story:
