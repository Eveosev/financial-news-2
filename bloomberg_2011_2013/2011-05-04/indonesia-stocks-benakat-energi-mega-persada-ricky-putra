Shares of the following companies had
unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  climbed 1.06 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 3,814.93.  Coal producers: PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ), the nation’s
largest coal producer, gained 2.9 percent to 3,575 rupiah, the
highest close since Sept. 24, 2008. PT Adaro Energy (ADRO IJ),
the second largest, climbed 1.1 percent to 2,250 rupiah.  Coal inventories in  China , which generates about 70 percent
of its electricity from the fuel, have dropped to an 11-month
low, pushing prices higher, as the country faces electricity
shortages. China’s power plants had total inventories of 8.6
million metric tons at the end of last month, “which amounts to
an alarming low of nine days’ consumption versus the norm of two
weeks,”  Helen Lau , an analyst for UOB Kay Hian Ltd. in  Hong
Kong , said in a report yesterday.  PT Indofood Sukses Makmur (INDF IJ), which owns  Indonesia ’s
biggest instant-noodle maker, gained 0.9 percent to 5,550
rupiah, the steepest increase since April 20. The company’s
Singapore-listed palm oil unit,  Indofood Agri Resources Ltd. (IFAR) ,
had its share-price estimate raised to S$2.79 from S$2.67 at DMG
& Partners Securities Pte, which kept a “buy” recommendation
on the stock.  PT Ricky Putra Globalindo (RICY IJ), the producer of men’s
underwear, rose 6.3 percent to 185 rupiah, the highest close
since March 25. The company’s first-quarter net income more than
doubled from a year earlier to 5.13 billion rupiah ($599,000).  To contact the reporter on this story:
