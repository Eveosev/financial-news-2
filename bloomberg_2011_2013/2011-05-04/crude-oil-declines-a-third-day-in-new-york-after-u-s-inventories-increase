Crude oil dropped to a two-week low as
a U.S. Energy Department report showed supplies surged and on
signals that American economic growth is slowing.  Oil fell 1.6 percent after the report showed stockpiles
rose 3.42 million barrels to 366.5 million last week, the
highest level since October. Inventories were forecast to gain 2
million barrels, a Bloomberg News survey showed. Lower-than-
forecast expansion in  service industries  and employment reduced
optimism about the economic outlook.  “The inventory numbers were much more bearish than
expected,” said Andre Julian, chief financial officer and
senior market strategist at OpVest Wealth Management in  Irvine ,
 California . “We were already poised for a move lower when the
inventory data and the negative economic numbers came out. This
is looking like a perfect time to take risk off the table.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.81 to $109.24 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
April 19. Prices are up 32 percent from a year ago.  Stockpiles of crude oil at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade,
gained 102,000 barrels to 40.5 million.  Gasoline inventories fell 1.05 million barrels to 204.5
million last week, the lowest level since June 2009. Supplies
were forecast to drop 500,000 barrels, according to the median
of 15 analyst responses in the Bloomberg News survey. Stockpiles
of distillate fuel, a category that includes heating oil and
diesel, declined 1.4 million barrels to 145.1 million.  Gasoline for June delivery decreased 0.69 cent to settle at
$3.3225 a gallon in New York.  Surging Pump Prices  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide,
increased 1.5 cents to $3.982 a gallon yesterday, the most since
July 25, 2008, AAA said on its  website .  Gasoline consumption dropped 2.2 percent to 8.94 million
barrels a day last week, the report showed.  “Gasoline demand has slipped to the lowest level since the
week ended April 1,” said Sean Brodrick, a natural resource
analyst with  Weiss Research  in Jupiter,  Florida . “High pump
prices are obviously having an impact on demand and may be
hurting the overall economy as well.”  Refineries operated at 82.8 percent of capacity, up 0.1
percentage point from the prior week. That’s down from 89.6
percent of capacity a year earlier.  Employment Gain  Oil also declined after U.S. companies added fewer jobs
than forecast. Employment rose by 179,000 in April from a
revised 207,000 the prior month, according to figures from ADP
Employer Services. The median estimate of 34 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News called for a 198,000 increase.  Businesses added 200,000 jobs in April and the jobless rate
held at 8.8 percent, economists project a Labor Department
report to show in two days.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing companies slumped to 52.8 in April, the lowest
level since August, from 57.3 a month earlier. The median
forecast of 73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 57.5.
Readings greater than 50 signal growth.  The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s index of the industry,
which accounts for about 90 percent of the economy, averaged
56.1 in the five years to December 2007, when the last recession
began. The ISM services survey covers industries that range from
utilities and retailing to health care, finance and
transportation.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index declined 0.7 percent to
1,347.01, and the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  slipped 90.06
points to 12,717.45 at 3:08 p.m.  Inflation Concerns  “ China  and  India  are taking steps to tame inflation, which
could further slow economic growth,” Julian said.  China’s central bank said in a first-quarter monetary
policy report published yesterday that taming inflation is its
top priority.  The  Reserve Bank  of India announced a half a percentage
point increase in the benchmark repurchase rate to 7.25 percent
yesterday, the biggest change since July 2008. Governor  Duvvuri
Subbarao  indicated the central bank would tighten borrowing
costs further and projected inflation will stay at “elevated
levels” until September.  China and India are the world’s second- and fourth-biggest
oil-consuming countries, responsible for 14 percent of demand in
2009, according to BP Plc, which publishes its BP Statistical
Review of World Energy each June. The U.S. and  Japan  are the
largest and third-biggest consumers.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
dropped 1.8 percent to 358.63, the lowest level since March 30.  Middle East Unrest  Oil has climbed 20 percent in  New York  this year as unrest
in the Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Egypt and
Tunisia and spread to  Libya , Algeria, Bahrain, Iran, Oman, Syria
and Yemen. Forces loyal to  Muammar Qaddafi  attacked rebel-held
cities in western Libya as ministers from 22 nations prepared to
meet in Rome to discuss ways to end the fighting.  Brent crude for June settlement slipped $1.26, or 1
percent, to end the session at $121.19 a barrel on the London-
based ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Oil volume in electronic trading on the Nymex was 540,711
contracts as of 3:09 p.m. in New York. Volume totaled 529,239
contracts yesterday, 27 percent below the average of the past
three months. Open interest was 1.62 million contracts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
