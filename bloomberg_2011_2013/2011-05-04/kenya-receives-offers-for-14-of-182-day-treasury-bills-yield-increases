Yields on  Kenya ’s 182-day Treasury
bills rose to the highest in almost a year and the central bank
sold only 14 percent of the debt on offer at an auction today as
inflation surges in the country, curbing returns.  The central bank of East Africa’s biggest economy offered
2.5 billion shillings of the debt and received 360 million
shillings of bids, it said in an e-mailed statement today from
the capital, Nairobi. It accepted all bids. The average yield on
the securities climbed to 3.691 percent from 3.58 percent at the
previous auction, the Central Bank of Kenya said.  “The low bids is a clear indication of the effect of the
tight liquidity as a result of the mopping up exercise that the
central bank has been undertaking,” Fred Mweni, managing
director of Nairobi-based Tsavo Securities Ltd., said by phone.  Central Bank of Kenya has been mopping up liquidity to curb
accelerating inflation, Mweni said. Kenyan inflation surged to
12.05 percent in April, exceeding the central bank’s 5 percent
target for the fourth straight month, as food prices jumped 19
percent from a year earlier. Higher inflation erodes returns on
fixed-income securities.  “They need to reconsider the tightening exercise as the
resultant liquidity crunch is now being reflected through under-
subscription of the securities, even as yields rise,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
