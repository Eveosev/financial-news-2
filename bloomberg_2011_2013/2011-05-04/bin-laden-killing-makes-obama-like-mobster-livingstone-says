Former  London  Mayor Ken Livingstone
said the killing of  Osama bin Laden  makes U.S. President Barack Obama “look like some sort of mobster,” the  Evening Standard 
newspaper reported.  Livingstone, who is the main opposition Labour Party’s
candidate in next year’s mayoral election, told the London-based
newspaper that the images of Americans celebrating on the
streets also made a terror attack on the U.K. more likely.  “We should have captured him and put him on trial,”
Livingstone said. “It’s a simple point -- are we gangsters or a
Western democracy based on the rule of law? This undermines any
commitment to democracy and trial by jury and makes Obama look
like some sort of mobster.”  Cheering crowds gathered spontaneously outside the White
House in  Washington  and at the  World Trade Center site  in  New
York  when word that bin Laden had died in a U.S. commando raid
on his compound in Pakistan was announced.  “I just looked at it and realised that it would increase
the likelihood of a terror attack on London,” Livingstone said
of the celebrations. “That’s very much the American style but I
don’t think I’ve ever felt pleased at the death of anybody. The
real problem for London is that after America we’re a big target
so it’s a very dangerous time at the moment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
