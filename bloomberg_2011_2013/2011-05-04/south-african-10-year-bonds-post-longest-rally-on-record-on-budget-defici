The rand weakened for a third day
against the euro on speculation  South Africa ’s central bank will
lag behind its euro-region counterpart in raising rates.  The South African currency declined as much as 0.8 percent
to 9.9171 per euro, its weakest level since April 21, and traded
0.6 percent down at 9.9027 per euro as of 5:17 p.m. in
Johannesburg. It was 0.5 percent weaker at 6.6599 per dollar.  The euro reached its highest level in 17 months against the
dollar today on speculation European Central Bank President
 Jean-Claude Trichet  will signal further rate increases after
policy makers meet tomorrow. The ECB raised its benchmark
interest rate to 1.25 percent on April 7 from a record low 1
percent. South African vehicle sales rose the least in 16 months
in April, an industry group said today, fueling speculation the
 Reserve Bank  will hold its benchmark rate at 5.5 percent.  “The ECB has adopted a tightening bias,” Tradition
Analytics researchers led by Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw said in a research note. “The rand could indeed find
itself on the defensive.”  South Africa’s currency has declined 3.3 percent against
the euro after the ECB raised its  reference rate  on April 7,
eroding extra yield investors receive for holding rand assets.  The country’s benchmark 10-year bond declined, snapping an
eight-day advance. The 6.75 percent security due 2021 slipped 7
cents to 88.60 rand, driving the yield up one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 8.47 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
