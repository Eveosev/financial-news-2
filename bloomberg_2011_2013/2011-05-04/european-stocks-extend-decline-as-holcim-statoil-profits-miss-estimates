European stocks dropped for a second
day after companies from Holcim Ltd. to Statoil ASA reported
earnings that missed analysts’ estimates. Asian shares and U.S.-
index futures also fell.  Holcim slid 4.4 percent after the world’s second-biggest
cement maker reported decreased profit as raw-material costs
climbed. Statoil, Norway’s largest oil and gas company, lost 1.3
percent as first-quarter earnings fell. Anheuser-Busch InBev NV
sank 2.7 percent as the world’s biggest brewer reported first-
quarter volume that missed estimates as high unemployment levels
in the U.S. caused consumers to drink less beer.  The Stoxx 600 slid 0.4 percent to 281.2 at 8:03 a.m. in
 London . The gauge in April had the biggest monthly increase so
far this year as companies reported earnings that topped analyst
estimates and the  Federal Reserve  maintained its pledge to keep
 interest rates  low for an “extended period.”  Futures contracts on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
futures expiring in June slid 0.2 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific
Excluding Japan Index dropped 1.3 percent. Japanese markets are
closed for a public holiday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
