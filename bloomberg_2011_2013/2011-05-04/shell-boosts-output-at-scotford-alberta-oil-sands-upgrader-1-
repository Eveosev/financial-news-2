Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  began commercial
production from an expansion of its Scotford oil-sands upgrader
that will boost capacity by 64 percent at the  Alberta  facility.  The expansion will add 100,000 barrels a day of bitumen
processing capability at the plant, 25 miles (40 kilometers)
northeast of  Edmonton , Shell said in a statement. The plant will
be able to run 255,000 barrels a day.  Shell and its partners in the Athabasca Oil Sands Project
have been expanding mining of oil-soaked sands in northeastern
Alberta. Bitumen, or extra-heavy oil, is diluted and shipped to
upgraders where it can be refined into other petroleum products.
Non-upgraded bitumen sells at a discount to regular crude oil.  “They had a mine expansion last fall that added about
100,000 barrels a day of bitumen,” said Mike Dunn, an analyst
with FirstEnergy Capital Corp. in Calgary. The reduction of
bitumen in the market is “good for heavy oil products,” he
said.  Shell said it will now work on improving operating
efficiencies at the Scotford complex, which includes a refinery
with a capacity of about 98,000 barrels a day. The company is
also working on a carbon capture and storage project at the
facility.  Shell, which is based in  The Hague , owns 60 percent of the
Athabasca Oil Sands Project. Marathon Oil Corp. and Chevron
Corp. split the rest.  To contact the reporter on this story:
