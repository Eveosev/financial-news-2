The following companies are having
unusual price changes in Bogota trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses and prices are as of 11:13 a.m. New York time.  The IGBC Index fell 1 percent to 13,976.28, while the
Colcap Index dropped 0.7 percent to 1,660.88.  Cementos Argos (CEMARGOS CB),  Colombia ’s biggest cement
maker, rose 2.1 percent to 10,720 pesos, the most since March
18, after the company announced appraisal results for 5,242
hectares of property in northern Colombia. The properties nearly
doubled in value to $1.5 billion.  “That’s a very positive development and will affect the
stock,” said  Andres Jimenez , head of international sales at
Interbolsa SA.  Grupo Aval Acciones y Valores (AVAL)  SA, Colombia’s
biggest financial holding company, fell for a third day,
dropping 0.8 percent to 1,330 pesos, its lowest in five months,
as shareholders who had bid high on the company’s oversubscribed
share issuance seek to sell off extra shares, Jimenez said.  Isagen SA (ISAGEN CB), a Colombian energy company, rose 0.2
percent to 2,330 pesos, after the company said first-quarter net
income increased to 122.5 billion pesos ($69 million). A year
earlier, profit was 78.2 billion pesos, the company said in a
statement posted yesterday on the website of Colombia’s
securities regulator.  Oil companies  fell as crude oil extended its drop after a
U.S. government report showed a bigger-than-forecast increase in
inventories.  Ecopetrol SA (ECOPETL)  , Colombia’s state-run  oil
company , fell 1.5 percent to 3,740 pesos.  Pacific Rubiales (PREC CB) declined 2.2 percent to 50,780
pesos, its lowest in a month.  Canacol Energy Ltd. (CNE)  , the Calgary-based oil
company that operates fields in  South America , dropped 3.7
percent to 2,200 pesos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
