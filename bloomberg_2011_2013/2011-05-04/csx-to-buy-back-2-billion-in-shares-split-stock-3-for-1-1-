CSX Corp. (CSX) , the second-largest publicly
traded U.S. railroad, said it will buy back as much as $2
billion in shares and split the company’s stock 3-for-1.  CSX also raised its quarterly dividend 38 percent to 36
cents a share, the Jacksonville, Florida-based company said
today in a regulatory filing. The board’s approval lets the
company increase its shares to 1.8 billion from 600 million.  CSX is returning cash to shareholders as profit has risen
at U.S. railroads amid the economic recovery. CSX said last
month that quarterly earnings gained 30 percent as shipping
volumes climbed.  The buyback, split and dividend raise “reflect the success
of CSX and its confidence in the future,” Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Michael Ward said in a statement. “They build
upon the $2 billion investment CSX is making this year to meet
the nation’s future transportation needs.”  The stock split and new dividend payout will be carried out
on June 15 for shareholders as of May 31, according to the
filing. The buyback program should be completed by the end of
2012, the company said in the statement.  CSX fell 53 cents to $77.41 at 10:38 a.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares rose 21 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
