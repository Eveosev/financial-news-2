L’Oreal SA (OR) , the world’s largest
cosmetics maker, expects The Body Shop revenue to grow at the
same pace as the rest of the company by 2014 as it expands in
new regions, Chief Executive Officer Jean-Paul Agon said.  The Body Shop, the retailer of natural beauty products that
L’Oreal bought in 2006 for 652 million pounds ($973 million),
will match the Paris-based company’s growth “in the next two
years to three years,” Agon said in an interview last month.  The Body Shop’s annual sales have been below their 2007
level every year since, prompting analysts and investors to
question the purchase. Excluding acquisitions and currency
shifts, revenue rose 0.8 percent in the first quarter after
declining in the previous nine months as the retailer
accelerated the pace of new products and sold more in markets
including the Middle East and  Asia . Overall, L’Oreal sales
climbed 5.8 percent between January and March on the same basis.  “We expect it is going to be a long haul back to sustained
quality, growth and it is perhaps too soon to be confident of
eventual success,”  Andrew Wood , an analyst at Sanford C.
Bernstein, wrote in an April 20 note, referring to Body Shop.  L’Oreal forecasts it will outperform the global cosmetics
market in 2011, which it estimates will grow about 4 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
