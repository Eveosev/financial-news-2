Syrian President Bashar al-Assad said
yesterday that the army will end its operations in the southern
province of Daraa “very soon,” the Damascus-based  Al Watan 
newspaper reported.  Assad, who was speaking to a group of communities from the
northeastern provinces, said the events that transpired in  Syria 
can happen in any country, according to Al Watan.  Syria sent troops on April 25 to quell demonstrations,
inspired by popular revolts in Egypt and Tunisia that have
spread across the country and posed the most serious challenge
to the 11-year rule of Assad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
