Chimei Innolux Corp. (3481)  fell to the
lowest in more than two years in Taipei trading after  Taiwan ’s
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays posted a first-quarter
loss that was wider than analysts’ estimates.  The stock declined 2.4 percent to NT$28.30 at the 1:30 p.m.
close in Taipei trading, the lowest since March 3, 2009. Chimei
Innolux has slumped 30 percent this year, compared with the 0.3
percent drop in Taiwan’s benchmark Taiex Index.  The first-quarter net loss was NT$13.8 billion ($483
million), the Miaoli, Taiwan-based company said in a statement
yesterday. The average of nine analysts’ estimates in the past
28 days compiled by Bloomberg was for a loss of NT$9.7 billion.  Chimei Innolux’s stock rating was cut to “neutral” from
“buy” at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. The brokerage reduced its
share-price estimate to NT$34 from NT$41, analysts led by Liang- chun Lin wrote in a report. Taiwan’s panel makers face
challenges including a longer learning curve for new products,
while a fragmented product mix and customer base make operations
less efficient, according to the report.  Revenue was NT$124 billion, 4.6 percent lower than the
prior three-month period, the company said.  “Pricing was sub-optimal during the quarter as TV panel
prices were still weaker,” Eddie Chen, a company spokesman,
said by telephone yesterday.  Chimei Innolux, created in March last year through a merger
of three companies, joins  AU Optronics Corp. (2409)  and LG Display Co.
in extending losses as prices remain below profitable levels and
shipments missed its own target.  To contact the reporter on this story:
