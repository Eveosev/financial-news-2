Bulgaria ’s budget deficit should dip
below the European Union limit of 3 percent of gross domestic
product this year because of the government’s “prudent fiscal
management,” Moody’s Investors Service said today.  Bulgaria has cut spending and increased tax collection to
trim its deficit and targets a shortfall of 2.5 percent this
year, narrowing to 0.5 percent by 2014. Moody’s estimates the
deficit, which stood at 3.2 percent in 2010, will shrink toward
zero in the years ahead, helped by accelerating economic growth.  The EU’s poorest member by per-capita GDP is emerging from
its deepest economic slump in more than a decade. The government
expects record exports to boost economic growth to 3.6 percent
this year from 0.2 percent in 2010 and a 5.1 percent contraction
in 2009.  Moody’s placed Bulgaria’s Baa3 sovereign rating “on review
for possible upgrade” April 5. The rating company today
welcomed a Finance Ministry plan to cement a budget deficit
limit of 2 percent of GDP and a spending limit of 40 percent in
the constitution.  “Competitive wages and low tax rates should help maintain
private sector investment, while public investment will also be
supported by EU structural funds,” Moody’s said. A government
plan to raise incomes to 60 percent of the euro-area average by
2020, from the current 40 percent, is “ambitious but not
altogether unrealistic.”  Bulgaria has the second-lowest debt in the EU after
Estonia, according to Moody’s. It shares its Baa3 rating, the
lowest investment grade, with  Hungary ,  Croatia ,  Romania  and
 Latvia .  To contact the reporters on this story:
