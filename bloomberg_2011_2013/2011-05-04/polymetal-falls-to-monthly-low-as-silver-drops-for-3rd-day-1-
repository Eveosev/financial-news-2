OAO Polymetal, the Russian precious-
metals producer, fell to its lowest price in more than a month
as silver futures dropped for a third day.  The shares slid 3.5 percent to 510.4 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the lowest price since March 22.  Silver for July delivery retreated 3.2 percent on the Comex
in  New York . A close at that price would take losses over three
days to 15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
