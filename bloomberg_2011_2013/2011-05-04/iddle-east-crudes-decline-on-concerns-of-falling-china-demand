Middle East crude oil for sale to  Asia 
fell on concerns that demand from China may slow as the country
tries to cool economic growth.  Oman oil for immediate loading fell $2.05, or 1.7 percent,
to $116.70 a barrel, according to Bloomberg data. Dubai for
loading in June dropped 1.7 percent to $116.47 and Murban crude
declined 1.6 percent to $120.46.  The Brent-Dubai exchange for swaps for June narrowed 5
cents to $6.63 a barrel, PVM data showed. The exchange for swaps
for July fell 2 cents to $6.71 a barrel.  Oman futures for June delivery advanced 63 cents to $117.01
a barrel on the  Dubai Mercantile Exchange  at 6:31 p.m. Singapore
time, with 1,112 contracts traded. The settlement price was at
$116.72 at 12:30 p.m. in Dubai.  China â€™s central bank has increased borrowing costs four
times since October to cool prices that grew at the fastest pace
since 2008 in March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
