Citrovita  and  Citrosuco  of  Brazil  won
European Union antitrust approval for their merger plan to form
the world’s largest wholesale supplier of orange juice.  The European Commission “is satisfied that there will
remain sufficient competition and that European consumers will
not be negatively impacted,”  Joaquin Almunia , the EU
competition commissioner, said in an e-mailed statement today.  Citrovita, controlled by Sao Paulo-based Votorantim
Participacoes SA, and Citrosuco, controlled by Matao, Brazil-
based  Grupo Fischer , said last May they would merge.  European regulators opened an in-depth probe in January
when they said the deal may raise competition problems because
the merged company would have a “strong” market position for
byproducts such as orange oils and essences.  Today’s decision “represents an important step in the
process to create the new company,” Citrovita and Citrosuco
said in an e-mailed joint statement. “However, the completion
of the merger process still requires the approval of the
Brazilian antitrust agency.”  The antitrust arm of Brazil’s finance ministry, known as
SEAE, has already recommended that regulator Cade approve the
deal without conditions.  Citrosuco and Citrovita own six processing plants in
Brazil, one in  Florida  and eight port terminals in Brazil,
Europe and Asia.  To contact the reporters on this story:
