Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) , Britain’s
biggest mortgage lender, appointed  Grainger Plc (GRI)  to manage
residential properties that are in the insolvency process after
borrowers defaulted on loans.  Grainger, the U.K.’s largest publicly traded residential
landlord, will receive fees based on rent and disposals from the
property portfolio, the Newcastle-Upon-Tyne-based company said
in a statement today.  “The transaction will deliver to Grainger a recurring
income stream with the potential for further upside without the
need to commit any group equity or debt,” Nick Jopling,
executive property director at Grainger, said in the statement.  Grainger manages about 20,000 properties in the U.K.,
according to the statement. Lloyds said yesterday it put 38
commercial properties up for sale as the company reduces real
estate lending amid declining values.  To contact the reporter on this story:
