U.S. stocks fell, with commodity
producers driving a third straight loss for the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index, as lower-than-estimated reports on  service
industries  and job growth damped optimism in the economy.  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  and  General Electric Co. (GE) , among companies
most-tied to the economy, fell at least 1.7 percent to lead
declines in the  Dow Jones Industrial Average .  Freeport-McMoRan
Copper & Gold Inc. (FCX)  and  Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY)  dropped more
than 2.4 percent as oil and metal prices sank.  Las Vegas Sands
Corp. (LVS) , the U.S. casino company expanding in Asia, slumped 7.3
percent after reporting profit that missed estimates.  The S&P 500 lost 0.7 percent to 1,347.32 at 4 p.m. in New
York. The index has dropped every day since closing at the
highest level since June 2008. The Dow average fell 83.93
points, or 0.7 percent, to 12,723.58 today. Oil for June
delivery declined 1.6 percent to $109.24 a barrel in New York.  “We’ve seen some tempering of economic statistics,” said
Michael Mullaney, who manages $9.5 billion at Fiduciary Trust in
Boston. “We’re going to see some sloppiness in the market until
we get a clear indication on whether the sluggishness in
economic activity is temporary. Employment growth is critical
for the economy becoming self-sustaining.”  The  S&P 500  extended its drop since April 29 to 1.2
percent. Oil, metal and chemical companies have led the market’s
slump. Silver futures have plunged 19 percent, the biggest
three-day drop since 1983, as increases in Comex margins spurred
investor sales. Oil has slumped 4.1 percent.  Earnings Reports  The S&P 500 has trimmed its 2011 gain to 7.1 percent. The
index rallied since Dec. 31 amid higher-than-estimated profits
and economic reports. Earnings-per-share beat estimates at 73
percent of the 359 companies in the S&P 500 that reported
results since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Stocks extended losses after a report showed that service
industries in the U.S. expanded in April at the slowest pace in
eight months as higher fuel prices prompted companies to cut
back. The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing companies declined to 52.8 last month from 57.3 in
March. Readings greater than 50 signal growth, and the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a
gain to 57.5. A gauge of new orders dropped by the most since
record-keeping began in 1997.  Stock-index futures fell before the start of trading as an
ADP Employer Services report showed that employment at U.S.
companies increased by 179,000 in April. The median estimate in
a survey called for a 198,000 increase this month. Estimates
ranged from a gain of 164,000 to 240,000, according to the
Bloomberg survey of 34 economists.  Jobs Report  Employment probably increased for a seventh straight month
in April, economists in a survey said before a U.S. Labor
Department report on May 6.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction
equipment, dropped 2.2 percent to $110.77. GE retreated 1.8
percent to $20.27.  U.S. equities also followed European and Asian shares lower
amid concern central banks will need to lift  interest rates  to
fend off accelerating inflation.  The  Federal Reserve  may start raising its benchmark
interest rate late this year, Miguel Savastano, the deputy
director for Western Hemisphere at the  International Monetary
Fund , told reporters today in Santiago.  ‘Critical’  The People’s Bank of China said stabilizing prices and
managing inflation expectations are “critical” after policy
makers from India and Brazil yesterday signaled further
tightening is possible. Interest-rate futures are indicating
European Central Bank President Jean-Claude Trichet may signal
more increases at the end of a policy meeting tomorrow.  Gauges of raw-material and energy producers led the
declines in the S&P 500 within 10 industries, falling at least
1.5 percent. Gold declined after a report that Soros Fund
Management LLC may have cut metal holdings. Crude oil dropped to
a two-week low as a U.S. Energy Department report showed
supplies surged.  Freeport-McMoRan, the largest publicly traded copper
producer, slumped 3.9 percent to $51.14. Occidental Petroleum
declined 2.5 percent to $108.89.  Las Vegas Sands fell 7.3 percent to $42.53. The casino
operator reported a first-quarter adjusted profit of 37 cents a
share, missing the average analyst estimate of 44 cents, amid
lower winnings from table games in Nevada.  First Solar Tumbles  First Solar Inc. (FSLR)  tumbled 6.2 percent to $126.31. The
largest maker of thin-film solar modules reported first-quarter
profit fell 33 percent as competition from Chinese manufacturers
increased and prices declined in  Europe , its largest market.  Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates Inc. (VSEA)  surged 51
percent to $61.36.  Applied Materials Inc. (AMAT) , the world’s largest
producer of chipmaking equipment, agreed to buy Varian for $4.9
billion in cash. Applied Materials will pay $63 a share, a 55
percent premium over yesterday’s closing price.  Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH)  rose 4.9 percent to $87.39, paring a
gain of as much as 8.2 percent. The maker of Raisin Bran and
Grape-Nuts cereal spurned a $4.9 billion offer from  ConAgra
Foods Inc. (CAG)  and adopted a shareholder rights plan to bar its
suitor from gaining control of its shares.  “We’re seeing a lot of M&A deals,” said Tom Wirth, senior
investment officer for Chemung Canal Trust Co., which manages
$1.6 billion in Elmira,  New York .  “I expect that trend to
continue as many of these companies have a huge amount of cash
on their balance sheets.”  Global Deals  About $834.3 billion in takeovers have been announced
globally so far in 2011, a 23 percent increase from the same
period in 2010, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Bank of America Corp. boosted forecasts for S&P 500
earnings in 2011 and 2012, citing more manufacturing and
business spending, as well as gains from higher foreign profits,
commodity prices and a weaker  U.S. dollar .  David Bianco , the bank’s New York-based chief U.S. equity
strategist, said S&P 500 companies will earn a total of $97 a
share in 2011, up from a prior projection of $95. In 2012, they
will post profit of $104, said Bianco, who had estimated $102.  Credit Suisse Group AG boosted its year-end forecast for
the S&P 500 to 1,275 from 1,250 while lifting the earnings-per-
share estimate for the benchmark to $94 from $91.  To contact the reporter on this story:
