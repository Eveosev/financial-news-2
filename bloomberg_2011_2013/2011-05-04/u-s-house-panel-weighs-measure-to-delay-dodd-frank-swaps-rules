U.S. House Agriculture Committee
members voted to advance legislation to delay Dodd-Frank Act
rules governing the  derivatives market  until the end of 2012.  The Republican proposal was approved today in a 25-20
party-line vote during a committee meeting in  Washington . The
bill, aimed at giving regulators more time to write rules and
avoid unintended consequences, would revise Dodd-Frank
requirements that most new derivatives regulations be completed
by mid-July. Regulators have said some of the deadlines will
slip until later this year.  “It doesn’t water the bill down and it’s not a kill
tactic,” said Frank D. Lucas, the Oklahoma Republican who leads
the Agriculture Committee. “It provides an additional 18 months
for rulemaking.”  Even if it is approved by the House, the measure would
likely face opposition from the Democrat-controlled Senate and
President  Barack Obama , who enacted the regulatory overhaul that
created the timetable last year.  “I think this is a partisan game, and frankly this bill
isn’t going anywhere in the Senate,” said Representative Collin Peterson, a Minnesota Democrat who led the panel before
Republicans took control of the House this year.  The House Financial Services Committee is scheduled to
consider the measure at a May 12 meeting.  To contact the reporter on this story:
