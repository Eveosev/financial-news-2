Botswana’s government said it will
impose a “No Work, No Pay” rule on striking employees as of
May 1.  The decision will affect all employees in central and local
government and teaching services who have been on strike in the
southern African nation since April 18, the government said in
an e-mailed statement today.  State employees have decided to continue striking until
next week, after which they will embark on a go-slow, Andrew
Motsamai, the secretary general of Botswana Federation of Public
Service Unions, said in an interview yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
