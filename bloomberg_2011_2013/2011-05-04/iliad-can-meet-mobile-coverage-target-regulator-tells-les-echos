France’s telecommunications regulator
expects  Iliad SA (ILD) ’s Free unit will be able to achieve its target
of providing a mobile-phone network covering 27 percent of the
country’s population by January 2012,  Les Echos  said, citing an
interview with Jean-Ludovic Silicani, head of the regulator.  The regulatory agency, known as Arcep, is optimistic that
Free will meet the goal, Silicani said in an interview,
according to the newspaper. The frequency access contract
between the country’s mobile-phone operators and  France Telecom
SA (FTE) , which owns the infrastructure, requires mobile operators to
meet their coverage obligations, the regulator said, according
to Les Echos. A violation of that duty would result in
sanctions, the newspaper quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
