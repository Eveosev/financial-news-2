OCI Co. retreated in Seoul trading
after First Solar Inc., the world’s largest maker of thin-film
solar modules, said first-quarter profit fell and forecast lower
sales for the year.   South Korea ’s biggest maker of polysilicon lost 4.4 percent
to 562,000 won as of 2:01 p.m. on the Korea Exchange.   “Weak result of some solar companies affected sentiment,
and there seems to be a bit of concern over polysilicon
prices,” said Lee Eung Ju, an analyst with Shinhan Investment
Corp. OCI shares have jumped 71 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
