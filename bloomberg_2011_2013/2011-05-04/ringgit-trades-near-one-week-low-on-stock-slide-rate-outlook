Malaysia’s ringgit traded near a one-
week low as regional stocks slid and economists forecast export
growth will slow.  Government bonds  declined.  The currency retreated from a 13-year high as nine of 16
economists surveyed by Bloomberg predicted the central bank will
leave its benchmark interest rate at 2.75 percent tomorrow. A
trade ministry report later this week will show exports grew in
March at the slowest pace in five months, according to a
separate survey. The MSCI Asia-Pacific Index of equities fell
0.8 percent.  “The situation has become a bit mixed and delicate to
balance for the central bank, given that the ringgit has rallied
a lot of late,” said Choong Yin Pheng, manager for economic and
fixed-income research at Hong Leong Bank Bhd. in Kuala Lumpur.  The ringgit was little changed at 2.9757 per dollar as of
4:40 p.m. in  Kuala Lumpur  versus 2.9755 yesterday, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency gained 2.1 percent in
April, its best monthly performance this year. It touched 2.9600
yesterday, the strongest level since September 1997.  Malaysia has tolerated a 3.6 percent rally in the ringgit
in the past six months as Prime Minister Najib Razak said the
advance was based on fundamentals. Consumer prices rose 3
percent in March from a year earlier, the most since April 2009.  Seven economists predicted the central bank will increase
borrowing costs to 3 percent tomorrow. “We are looking for a
pro-active, preemptive decision as inflation could remain
elevated,” Choong said.  The nation’s exports climbed 4.3 percent in March from a
year earlier, a separate survey showed before a trade ministry
report on May 6. That would be the smallest gain since October.  Bond Auction  Three-year bonds were little changed as the government
prepares to auction more debt. The treasury will sell existing
September 2017 notes and November 2016 Shariah-compliant debt
later this month, according to its auction schedule.  The yield on the 3.434 percent note maturing in August 2014
was 3.28 percent, according to Bursa Malaysia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
