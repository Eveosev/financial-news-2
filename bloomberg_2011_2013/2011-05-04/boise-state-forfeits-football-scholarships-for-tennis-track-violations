Boise State University  will forfeit
three football scholarships over the next two years as part of
self-imposed sanctions for National Collegiate Athletic
Association rules violations that extended to the school’s men’s
and women’s tennis and track and field programs.  The NCAA, the governing body of college athletics, said
Boise State coaches committed 22 violations in those sports from
2005 to 2010. Boise State  imposed penalties  in advance of its
June 10 hearing with the NCAA Infractions Committee, which could
assess further discipline.  Boise State cut three one-year football scholarships over
the 2011 and 2012 seasons. The Broncos, who had a 26-1 record
over the past two years, will also give up three practices
before their season-openers against  Georgia  in 2011 and
Michigan State in 2012.  The women’s tennis program lost three scholarships,
reduced its practice time, vacated wins involving ineligible
players and will be fined $5,000 for undisclosed rules
violations.  The school and NCAA didn’t disclose the nature of the
violations. The  Associated Press  said the infractions ranged
from coaches arranging summer housing and transportation for
potential football players to tennis and track athletes getting
impermissible meals and housing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
