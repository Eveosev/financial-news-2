Siemens (SIE GR),  Europe ’s largest
engineering company, said profit and sales this year will rise
more than it previously anticipated as customers buy more
industrial equipment and a unit overhaul starts to pay off.  Net income from continued operations will rise to at least
7.5 billion euros ($11.1 billion) in the fiscal year ending
Sept. 30, from a comparable 4.3 billion euros last year, Siemens
said today in a statement.  EQUITIES:
*Fresenius Medical Care (FME GR), the world’s biggest provider
of  kidney dialysis , said it expects to be more profitable this
year as the U.S. Medicare program eliminates fees for blood-
cleansing facilities in connection with reimbursement changes.
*Linde (LIN GR) said first-quarter profit rose 43
percent on demand from  Asia  and the health-care industry.
*Henkel (HEN3 GR) said first-quarter profit rose
10 percent as industrial customers bought more adhesives.
*Wincor Nixdorf (WIN GR) said second-quarter net income fell 8
percent to 24 million euros.
*Bayer (BAYN GR) Chief Executive Officer Marijn Dekkers said he
is open to a “merger of equals” for the company’s healthcare
unit.
*Drillisch (DRI GR) said it increased its stake in Internet
services provider Freenet AG to 20.2 percent from 15.2 percent
by buying shares held in the company by Bank of America Corp.
*Wacker Chemie (WCH GR) said first-quarter net rose 58.6 percent
to 168 million euros.  GOVERNMENT:
*Germany’s 16 states back the efforts of federal lawmakers to
secure influence over the future financial arrangements of the
European Stability Mechanism, Handelsblatt reported. The states
will have a seat in the governing council of the bail-out fund
and will reject any future ESM aid request unless the lower
house’s budget rights are anchored in national ESM legislation,
the newspaper said in a report.
*The European Union has set a June deadline for  Germany  to
clarify its plans for restructuring state-controlled lender
WestLB, Financial Times Deutschland reported, citing the
European Commission.  WHAT TO WATCH:
