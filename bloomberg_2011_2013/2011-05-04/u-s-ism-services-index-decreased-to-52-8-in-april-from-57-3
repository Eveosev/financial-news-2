Service industries  in the U.S.
expanded in April at the slowest pace in eight months as higher
fuel prices prompted companies to cut back.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing companies declined to 52.8 last month from 57.3 in
March. Readings greater than 50 signal growth, and the median
forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News called for a
gain to 57.5. A gauge of new orders dropped by the most since
record-keeping began in 1997.  Stocks fell and Treasuries rose on signs gasoline prices at
their highest levels in almost three years are blunting
purchases of other goods and services. Employment in the
services industry fell to a seven-month low, indicating
increased corporate costs may be restraining hiring, one reason
why the  Federal Reserve  last week said it would maintain record
monetary stimulus.  “It’s another sign that we’re losing momentum more broadly
in this recovery,” said Tim Quinlan, an economist at  Wells
Fargo Securities LLC  in  Charlotte ,  North Carolina . “Businesses
are still concerned about pricing power.”  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 73 economists ranged
from 54.5 to 59. The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s index of the
industry, which accounts for about 90 percent of the economy,
averaged 56.1 in the five years to December 2007, when the last
recession began.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.8 percent to 1,346
at 10:52 a.m. in  New York . The yield on the benchmark 10-year
Treasury note declined to 3.22 percent from 3.25 percent late
yesterday.  New Orders  The ISM’s measure of new orders at service providers
decreased to 52.7, the lowest since December 2009, from 64.1 in
March, while a gauge of business activity, which reflects
sentiment among purchasers, fell to 53.7 from 59.7 in March.  The group’s employment gauge dropped to 51.9 from 53.7 a
month earlier. The index of prices paid fell to 70.1 from 72.1.  Employment at U.S. companies increased by 179,000 in April,
according to figures today from ADP Employer Services. The
median estimate in a Bloomberg survey called for a 198,000 gain.  ISM’s index of services industries, which account for about
90 percent of the economy, averaged 56.1 in the five years to
December 2007, when the last recession began.  Gasoline Prices  Fueled by spreading unrest in the Middle East, the average
price of a gallon of regular gasoline at the pump advanced to
$3.97 on May 2, the highest since July 2008, according to data
from AAA, the nation’s biggest motoring group.  Forced to spend more for food and fuel, household purchases
have cooled.  Consumer spending  adjusted for inflation rose at a
2.7 percent annual pace in the first quarter, down from 4
percent in the last three months of 2010, the Commerce
Department said last week.  The ISM services survey covers industries that range from
utilities and retailing to health care, finance and
transportation. Today’s report follows the group’s May 2 figures
that showed manufacturing grew more than forecast in April,
driven by gains in exports and inventories.  The services gauge has averaged 53.1 since the recovery
started in June 2009 through March, trailing the 56.2 reading on
the group’s factory measure during the same period.  Factory Rebound  The factory rebound, which is driven by exports and
corporate investment, is generating more demand for services.
Companies like restaurants and airlines are seeing enough demand
to pass increased costs onto consumers.  Denver-based  Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. (CMG) , the burrito chain
spun off from McDonald’s Corp. in 2006, last month reported a 23
percent gain in first-quarter profit as consumers dined out
more. The company raised prices last quarter on the West coast
and plans to begin increasing prices elsewhere to recover higher
costs.  “We continue to believe we have pricing power, but we want
to be patient and allow our transactions to hold as strong as
possible in this still-recovering economy,”  Chief Financial
Officer John Hartung said on an April 20 conference call.  The economy probably generated 185,000 jobs in April after
gaining 216,000 the prior month, according to the median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg before the Labor
Department’s May 6 payrolls report.  Companies are turning more optimistic about hiring.  Oak
Brook , Illinois-based  McDonald’s Corp. (MCD) , the world’s largest
restaurant chain by revenue, sought as many as 50,000 workers in
the U.S. during its National Hiring Day event on April 19.  “The economic recovery is proceeding at a moderate pace
and overall conditions in the labor market are improving
gradually,” the Fed said last week after its latest policy
meeting. “Household spending and business investment in
equipment and software continue to expand.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
