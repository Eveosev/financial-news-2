Gasoline futures declined as motor
fuel demand slipped with prices at the pump approaching $4 a
gallon and reports on hiring and the service industry pointed to
a weaker U.S. economic recovery.  Futures sank a third day as average retail prices surged to
the highest level since July 2008 and consumption slipped to a
four-week low, according to Energy Department data. Figures from
ADP Employer Services showed April employment rose by 179,000,
the smallest gain since October.  Service industries  expanded in
April at the slowest pace in eight months.  “The concern is that demand will be weak because of the
high prices and weak jobs market,” said  Phil Flynn , vice
president of research at PFGBest in  Chicago .  Gasoline for June delivery dropped 2.9 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $3.3004 a gallon at 12:28 p.m. on the  New York
Mercantile Exchange . It would be the first three-day losing
streak since March 15.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing companies declined to 52.8 last month from 57.3 in
March. The ISM’s measure of new orders at service providers
decreased to 52.7, the lowest since December 2009, from 64.1 in
March. This follows a report yesterday that the ISM’s
manufacturing index slipped to a four-month low in April.  Demand, as measured by deliveries to wholesalers, fell 2.2
percent in the week ended April 29 to an average 8.94 million
barrels a day. On a four-week average, consumption was 1.9
percent below a year earlier, wider than the 1.6 percent drop
the prior week, according to department data.  “Demand is definitely feeling the pinch of high retail
prices,” said  Sander Cohan , an analyst with Energy Security
Analysis Inc in Wakefield,  Massachusetts .  Gasoline Supplies  Gasoline stockpiles fell an 11th consecutive week, losing
1.05 million barrels to 204.5 million. That’s the lowest level
in 22 months. Gasoline inventories have shed 36.6 million
barrels, or 15 percent, since Feb. 11.  Imports jumped to 1.11 million barrels a day, the highest
level in three months. Refinery rates increased 0.1 percentage
point to 82.8 percent, the third straight gain, and are 6.8
percentage points below a year earlier.  “You still have low refinery runs, low production, lower
supplies,” Cohan said. “But, although U.S. refiners haven’t
quite come back, the spreads are pulling import barrels from
 Europe .”  Stockpiles of distillates dropped 1.4 million barrels to
145.1 million, the lowest level since March 2010. Demand
increased 4.2 percent to 3.89 million barrels a day. The four-
week average is 6.9 percent above a year earlier, according to
the department.  Regular retail gasoline rose 1.5 cents to $3.982 a gallon
yesterday, AAA said on its website. The record was $4.114 on
July 15, 2008.  Heating oil for June delivery dropped 4.98 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $3.141 a gallon on the exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
