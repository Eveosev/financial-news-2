The cost of protecting corporate bonds
from non-payment rose in  Australia , according to traders of
credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 1.5 basis points
to 105 basis points as of 10:28 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking
Corp. prices show. The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50
investment-grade borrowers outside Japan was little changed at
106 as of 8:28 a.m. in Singapore, according to Royal Bank of
Scotland Group Plc.  Markets in Japan are shut today for a public holiday. The
Markit iTraxx Japan index closed at 120.5 basis points on May 2,
its last trading day before Golden Week, prices from data
provider CMA show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
