U.S. natural-gas supplies probably
rose less than the seasonal average last week as lower nuclear
production boosted demand for the power-plant fuel, according to
analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Inventories rose 67 billion cubic feet to 1.752 trillion in
the week ended April 29, according to the median of 17
estimates. The five-year average stockpile change for the week
is an increase of 78 billion, according to Energy Department
data. Supplies jumped 83 billion cubic feet a year earlier.  U.S. nuclear-power output fell to a 10-year low last week
before falling further this week after storms ripped through
Southern states, knocking out power to nuclear reactors
including the Browns Ferry plant in  Alabama . Nuclear plants
provide 20 percent of U.S. electricity generation while natural
gas powers 24 percent, according to the Energy Department.  “It will probably be at the low end of the range, given
the nuclear outage last week,” said Brad Florer, a trader at
Kottke Associates Inc., an energy trading firm in Louisville,
 Kentucky .  The stockpile estimates ranged from increases of 55 billion
to 72 billion cubic feet. The Energy Department is scheduled to
release its weekly supply report at 10:30 a.m. tomorrow.  Nuclear power generation nationwide declined to 68,667
megawatts, the lowest level since 1999, on May 2, according to a
Nuclear Regulatory Commission report and data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Nuclear Generation  Nuclear units typically shut for refueling and maintenance
in the spring and fall, when power demand is lowest. The
 Tennessee Valley Authority  shut all three reactors at Browns
Ferry after thunderstorms and high winds on April 27 damaged
offsite power supplies.  Temperatures were in a normal range last week in the U.S.
East. The low in New York on April 25 was 45 degrees Fahrenheit
(7 Celsius), 2 degrees above normal for the day, according to
 AccuWeather Inc.  in  State College ,  Pennsylvania .  Stockpiles rose 31 billion cubic feet to 1.685 trillion in
the week ended April 22, the Energy Department reported last
week. Analysts expected an increase of 38 billion.  Gas on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  gained 4.4 percent
to $4.571 per million British thermal units on April 28 after
last week’s report was released. Prices declined 3.2 cents, or
0.7 percent, to $4.638 at 12:07 p.m. today.  The number of rigs drilling for natural gas in the U.S.
increased 4 to 882 last week, according to Houston-based Baker
Hughes Inc. The gas rig count has dropped 11 percent since
touching 992 in the week ended Aug. 13.  To contact the reporters on this story:
