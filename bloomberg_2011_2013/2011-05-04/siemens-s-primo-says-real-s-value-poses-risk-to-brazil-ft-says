Adilson Antonio Primo,  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s
chief executive officer for  Brazil , said the value of Brazil’s
real poses “a risk of deindustrialization” for the country,
the Financial Times reported, citing an interview.  Siemens’s exports from the country shrank to 12 percent of
its products made in Brazil from 20 percent four years ago, the
FT said.  While Primo is “not advocating protectionism,” he said
the country needs “wider measures, harsher measures” to
control the currency, the newspaper reported. If the real
strengthened beyond 1.50 per dollar “that would be a real
disaster for us,” Primo said, according to the FT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
