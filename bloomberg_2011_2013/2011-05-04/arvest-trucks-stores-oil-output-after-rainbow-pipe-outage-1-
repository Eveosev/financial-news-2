Harvest Operations Corp. is trucking
and storing its crude output from two sites after Plains
Midstream Canada’s Rainbow oil pipeline shut following a leak,
said Jeremy Dietz, a spokesman for the company.  “For the month of May we don’t anticipate any reduction in
production levels or material impact, assuming the line restarts
in the next week,” Calgary-based Dietz said. A section of the
pipeline in northern  Alberta  was shut April 29.  Production from the Hay River and Red Earth areas, which
feed crude to the line, was around 8,500 barrels of crude a day
in 2010, Dietz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
