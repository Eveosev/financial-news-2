Blacks Leisure Group Plc (BSLA) , a U.K.
outdoor-clothing and footwear retailer, said it narrowed its
full-year pretax loss as colder-than-usual winter weather pushed
up sales.  The pretax loss for the fiscal year to Feb. 26 was 5.3
million pounds ($8.7 million), compared with a 43.6 million-
pound loss a year earlier, the Northampton, England-based
company said in a Regulatory News Service statement today.
Revenue from continuing operations fell 16 percent to 201.9
million pounds. Sales in stores open at least a year jumped 10.2
percent, boosted by demand over Christmas.  “Despite being impacted by weak  consumer spending  in the
early part of 2011 particularly, in common with other retailers,
the strong winter trading performance meant that the second half
recovered some of the first-half decline,” Chairman David Bernstein said in the statement.  Julia Reynolds, currently the chief executive officer of
Figleaves.com, an online lingerie retailer, will replace Neil Gillis as CEO at Blacks Leisure toward the end of the summer,
the company said.  Gross margins for the year fell to 48.7 percent, from 51.6
percent the year before, as a result of stock discounting in the
first half, the company said.  Sales since the end of the fiscal year haven’t met
forecasts and Blacks Leisure faces a “challenging year,”
Bernstein said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
