Centragas Holding AG, an Austrian
company owned by Ukrainian billionaire Dmitry Firtash, took
control of Ukraine’s VAT Nadra Bank after purchasing the
lender’s additional shares for 3.5 billion hryvnia ($439.2
million).  Centragas now has 89.9 percent of Nadra’s statutory capital
as it bought 100 percent of additional shares, issued by the
bank, Nadra said today in a statement on its website.  Ukraine’s central bank put Nadra into temporary
administration in February 2009 and prolonged it this year after
the lender ran out of cash during the global financial crisis.
The country needs either to put it back into operation or
liquidate it to receive another tranche of a $15.6 billion loan
from the  International Monetary Fund .  The former Soviet state secured the IMF’s loan in July last
year, its second bailout in two years. The fund has released
$3.4 billion in two tranches, helping the government cover its
 budget deficit  and boost foreign-currency reserves. The third
disbursement, initially planned for March, has been delayed as
the government and legislature failed to adopt a pension law
that would raise the  retirement age  for women. The state was
also expected to stabilize banking system, including to solve
the Nadra’s issue.  Natsionalnyi Bank Ukrainy has five banks under temporary
administration apart from Nadra and 18 banks are being
liquidated now, according to the regulator’s website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
