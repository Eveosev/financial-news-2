Slovenia’s rejection of the pension
overhaul would have direct costs of more than 300 million euros
($447 million), STA newswire  reported , citing Labor Minister
Ivan Svetlik.  “If we fail to adopt the pension reform, there will have
to be cuts in public workers’ wages, pensions and benefits
payments,” Svetlik was quoted as saying by the Slovenian
newswire.  Voters in the former Yugoslav nation will decide on the
measure in a June referendum that was called by the Slovenia’s
largest trade union. Lawmakers passed the pension overhaul in
December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
