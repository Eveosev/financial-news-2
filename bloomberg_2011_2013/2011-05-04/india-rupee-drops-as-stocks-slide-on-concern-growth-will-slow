India ’s rupee declined for a third day
as stocks fell on concern rising  interest rates  will slow the
economy.  The nation’s benchmark share index slipped 0.4 percent
after the  Reserve Bank  of India said yesterday economic
expansion may slow to “around 8 percent” in the year that
began April 1 from an estimated 8.6 percent in the previous 12
months. The central bank also raised its repurchase rate to 7.25
percent from 6.75 percent to cap inflation, the ninth increase
since March 2010.  “We think the rupee will likely depreciate,” given the
capital outflows from the equity markets, analysts at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. including Mumbai-based Tushar Poddar wrote in a
research note.  The rupee dropped 0.1 percent to 44.5475 per dollar as of
11:07 a.m. in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It fell to 44.62 earlier, the weakest level since April 26.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 45.28 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations of 45.22
yesterday. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell assets at a
set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are settled in
dollars.  Overseas investors pared holdings of Indian stocks by $531
million last week, the most since February, exchange data show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
