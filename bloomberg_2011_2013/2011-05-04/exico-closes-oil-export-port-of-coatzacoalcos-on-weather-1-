Petroleos Mexicanos , Latin America’s
largest crude producer, closed its oil export terminal of
Coatzacoalcos on the  Gulf of Mexico  today because of adverse
weather.  The company shut its smallest terminal at the port of
Coatzacoalcos, also known as Pajaritos, according to a weather
bulletin posted today on the website of Mexico’s Merchant
Marine. The port of Dos Bocas and the port of Cayo Arcas remain
open.  Mexico, the largest supplier of oil to the U.S. after
 Canada , exported about 1.36 million barrels of crude a day in
2010, according to Energy Ministry statistics. About 84 percent
of the crude went to the U.S.  The Gulf of Mexico ports where Pemex, as the company is
known, operates close occasionally during the hurricane season
and winter because of storms. The Merchant Marine didn’t
elaborate on the weather conditions that forced the closure.  The company exported 907,490 barrels a day from Cayo Arcas,
241,726 barrels a day from Coatzacoalcos and 179,247 barrels a
day from Dos Bocas last year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
