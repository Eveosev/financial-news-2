Germany’s  Constitutional Court  ruled
that so-called preventive detention rules, used to keep violent
criminals in prison, are unconstitutional as currently regulated
in the country’s criminal code.  Existing preventive detention rules will remain in force
through May 31, 2013, in order to give lawmakers time to put in
place new regulations, the court in Karlsruhe, Germany, said in
its ruling today.  “In order to prevent a ‘legal vacuum’ the Federal
Constitutional Court has not declared the unconstitutional rules
to be null and void,” the court said in an e-mailed statement.
This would have meant “all people in preventive detention would
have had to immediately be released which would have confronted
courts, the authorities and police with problems that would be
almost impossible to solve.”  Preventive detention is used in  Germany  mainly to keep
violent convicted criminals locked up if they are still deemed
to pose a threat to society after the end of their prison terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
