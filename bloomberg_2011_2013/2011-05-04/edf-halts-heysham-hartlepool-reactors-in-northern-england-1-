Electricite de France SA halted
nuclear reactors at its Heysham-1 and Hartlepool plants in
northern  England ,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  The 580-megawatt Heysham-1 unit 2 stopped at about 6 a.m.
local time, grid data show. The halt was unplanned, Martyn
Butlin, a spokesman based at the power plant in Lancashire, said
by e-mail.“We are currently assessing the situation,” he said.
“At no time was anyone’s safety at risk.”  Reactor 2 at EDF’s Hartlepool site, with a capacity of 605
megawatts, stopped at about 7:30 p.m. yesterday as part of a
“planned refueling outage,” Butlin said.  Stations like Hartlepool switch off to refuel, while others
can refuel while still generating. About 20 percent of Britain’s
power supplies can come from nuclear stations so changes in
output can influence power prices. Atomic stations usually
operate around the clock.  Baseload power in the U.K. for tomorrow slipped 25 pence to
50.25 pounds a megawatt-hour as of 8:45 a.m., according to
broker data on Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
