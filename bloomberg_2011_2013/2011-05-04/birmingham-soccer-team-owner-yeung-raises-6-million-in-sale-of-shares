Premier League soccer team Birmingham
City’s holding company raised HK$49 million ($6.3 million) by
selling a 6 percent stake in a share sale.  Birmingham has been trying to raise funds after parent
company  Birmingham International Holdings Ltd. (2309)  said earlier this
year its liabilities exceeded assets by about HK$348 million. A
fully underwritten share sale in March raised HK$87 million.  Carson Yeung remains the biggest investor in BIH, according
to a filing today to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, although his
stake falls to 23.3 percent from 24.9 percent. That’s controlled
through a personal holding and his company Great Luck Management
Ltd.  The filing said 250 million shares, representing 6.43
percent of the company, were sold at 20 HK cents each to more
than five parties who aren’t connected to the company or to
anyone linked to it.  Birmingham’s long-term financial structure is being
examined by the Premier League after auditors for the team cast
doubt over its future.  The club also needs to convince European soccer’s governing
body about its finances. It qualified for the Europa League
after beating Arsenal in the League Cup final in February for
its first major trophy in 48 years. UEFA’s club licensing policy
requires teams with questionable accounts to explain how they
will continue to operate.  Birmingham is 15th in the 20-team Premier League with three
games remaining. It would be relegated to the second division
should it finish in the bottom three.  To contact the reporter on this story:
