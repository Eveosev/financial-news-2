The death of al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin
Laden may weaken al-Shabaab, the group of Islamic insurgents
fighting for control of  Somalia , Ethiopia’s National Security
Adviser said, according to Walta Information Center.  Al-Shabaab receives “financial and technical assistance”
from al-Qaeda, Addis Ababa-based WIC said, citing Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi’s adviser Tsegay Berhe.  Somalia has been mired in a civil war for two decades and
hasn’t had a functioning central government since the 1991
ouster of dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Most of southern and
central Somalia has been seized by al-Shabaab, while President
Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed’s government controls only parts of
Mogadishu, the capital, backed by African Union peacekeepers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
