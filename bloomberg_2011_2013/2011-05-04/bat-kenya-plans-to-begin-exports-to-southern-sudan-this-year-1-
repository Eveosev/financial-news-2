British American Tobacco Kenya Ltd. (BATK) ,
the cigarette manufacturer that exports to 17 countries, may
begin shipments to neighboring  Southern Sudan  later this year,
Managing Director Gary Fagan said.  Talks on shipping its products are “very much at the
exploratory stage,” Fagan told reporters today in Nairobi, the
Kenyan capital.  BAT, as the company is known, is speaking to the  Southern
Sudanese  government about issues such as the level of excise
duty that will be charged on the cigarettes, he said.  Over the last six years the company, the biggest cigarette
maker in east  Africa , has invested 5 billion shillings ($59.9
million) in expansion, with revenue in the three months to March
growing “according to expectations,” Fagan said.  Net income climbed 20 percent to 1.77 billion shillings
($21 million) in the 12 months through December as domestic and
export volumes increased, the company said on Feb. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
