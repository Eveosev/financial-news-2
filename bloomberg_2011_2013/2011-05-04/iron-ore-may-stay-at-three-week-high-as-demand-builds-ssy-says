Iron-ore  prices may find support
around the highest level in almost three weeks on stronger
demand for the steelmaking ingredient and limited supply, said
shipbroker Simpson Spence & Young.  Global steel production may rise 7 percent this year,
spurred by demand in China and  India , the world’s fastest-
growing major economies, Ernst & Young LLP said this week. China
is the biggest global consumer of iron ore.  “The  spot market  looks set for a high-priced period,”
SSY, the world’s second-biggest shipbroker, said in a report
dated yesterday. The construction season has picked up after a
stuttering start, while iron-ore supply from India is tightening
as the monsoon season approaches and steel demand in  China  is
buoying prices, it said.  The price of iron ore with 62 percent iron content
delivered to the Chinese port of Tianjin rose 2.1 percent in the
week to May 3 to $182.60 a metric ton, the highest level since
April 14, according to data from London-based Steel Business
Briefing.  China made 46 percent of the world’s crude steel in March,
according to data from the World Steel Association, an industry
group with offices in Brussels and Beijing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
