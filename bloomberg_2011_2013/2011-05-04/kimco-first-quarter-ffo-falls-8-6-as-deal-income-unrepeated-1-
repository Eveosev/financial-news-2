Kimco Realty Corp. (KIM) , the largest U.S.
owner of community shopping centers, said funds from operations
fell 8.6 percent in the first quarter as some income from
transactions a year ago wasn’t repeated.  FFO, which gauges a property company’s ability to generate
cash, decreased to $115.1 million, or 28 cents a share, from
$126 million, or 31 cents, a year earlier, the  New Hyde Park ,
New York-based company said today in a statement. Kimco was
expected to have FFO of 30 cents a share, the average estimate
of 15 analysts in a Bloomberg survey.  Kimco is selling non-retail investments and increasing its
purchases of neighborhood shopping centers. The company last
week said it sold A$165 million ($179 million) of Australian
real estate owner Valad Property Group’s convertible notes to a
Blackstone Group LP affiliate.  “They continue to get rid of things they don’t want,”
Rich Moore, an analyst at  RBC Capital Markets  in Solon, Ohio,
said in a telephone interview before the report. “They’re
looking at external growth.”  Three Shopping Centers  Kimco bought three shopping centers in the Philadelphia,
 New York  and Baltimore areas in the first quarter for $85.3
million, according to an April 27 statement.  Kimco recorded $17.8 million of “non-recurring” income in
the first quarter in the year-ago period, compared with $851,000
in the most recent three months. Excluding that income and
impairment charges, FFO rose to $121.2 million, or 30 cents a
share, from $115.6 million, or 28 cents, a year earlier.  Vacancies at U.S. neighborhood and community shopping
centers rose to 10.9 percent in the first quarter from 10.8
percent a year earlier, according to data from Reis Inc. The
rate was unchanged from the three previous quarters.  Kimco owned interests in 948 shopping centers in 44 U.S.
states,  Puerto Rico ,  Canada , Mexico and  South America  as of
March 31.  The company announced its results after the close of
regular U.S. trading. The stock rose a penny to $19.40 at 4:15
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares
have advanced 24 percent over the past year, compared with a 15
percent gain for the Bloomberg REIT Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
