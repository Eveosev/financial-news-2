VTB Bank OJSC (VTBR)  deposits in the first
quarter grew 30 percent after the bank merged VTB North-West and
its VIP St. Petersburg clients into it,  Vedomosti  said, citing
the bankâ€™s press service.  The VTB North-West deposits went to VTB, as the clients
have yet to decide on using the VTB-24 consumer unit or another
bank, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
