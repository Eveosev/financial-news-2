South Africa ’s latest unemployment
figures, which showed an increase in the jobless rate to 25
percent in the first quarter, were “not helpful,” Finance
Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in an interview in  Cape Town  today.  The government must find ways to help industry and create
jobs, besides looking to a weaker rand, Gordhan said. The
strength of the currency is having a negative impact on some
manufacturers, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
