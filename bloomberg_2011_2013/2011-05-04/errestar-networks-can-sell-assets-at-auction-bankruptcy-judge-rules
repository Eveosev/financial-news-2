TerreStar Networks Inc., the bankrupt
mobile communications company, can sell its assets at an auction
next month, a judge ruled.  TerreStar’s plan to hold a June 15 auction was approved
today by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Sean Lane at a court hearing in
 Manhattan . Bids for the company are due June 8.  TerreStar, based in Reston, Virginia, filed for bankruptcy
last year with a restructuring plan backed by creditor  EchoStar
Corp. (SATS)  TerreStar, which uses a satellite network to provide
mobile-communications service, withdrew the plan after it said
it didn’t have creditor support for the deal.  Arik Preis, TerreStar’s bankruptcy lawyer, declined to
comment after the hearing about potential bidders for the
company. TerreStar said in court papers in April that it was
negotiating a sale agreement with a buyer and couldn’t reach a
deal.  The case is In re TerreStar Networks Inc., 10-15446,  U.S.
Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of New York (Manhattan)  To contact the reporter on this story:
