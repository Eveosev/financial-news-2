that Soros Fund Management LLC may have cut metal holdings.  CME Group Ltd., Comex’s owner, raised the minimum amount of
cash that must be deposited when borrowing from brokers to trade
silver futures to $16,200 per contract from $14,513 as of the

lot more capital to participate in trading. Speculative fever
