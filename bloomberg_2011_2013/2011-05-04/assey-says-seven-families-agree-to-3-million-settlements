Massey Energy Co. (MEE) , owner of the Upper
Big Branch coal mine in West Virginia where 29 people died last
year, said seven families have agreed to its offer of $3 million
settlements for the relatives of each victim.  The settlements for four of those families have been
approved by West Virginia courts, the company said in an April
29 regulatory filing. Five families have filed wrongful death
suits against Richmond, Virginia-based Massey, it said.  Massey owned the mine near Montcoal that exploded April 5,
2010 in the deadliest U.S. coal accident in 40 years. The
company agreed in January to be acquired by  Alpha Natural
Resources Inc. (ANR)  for $7.1 billion.  Massey hasnâ€™t turned a profit since the accident. The
company reported May 2 that it had a first-quarter net loss of
$7.7 million, or 7 cents a share, versus a profit of $33.6
million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, because of lower
productivity at underground mines and difficulty staffing some
operations.  The company was cited by U.S. regulators yesterday for more
than two dozen safety violations at its Randolph Mine in Boone
County,  West Virginia .  To contact the reporter on this story:
