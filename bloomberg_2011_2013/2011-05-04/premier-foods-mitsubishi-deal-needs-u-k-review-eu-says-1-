Premier Foods Plc (PFD) ’s plan to sell its
canned-food business to  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058) ’s Princes unit for 182
million pounds ($300 million) should be reviewed by the U.K.’s
antitrust regulator, the European Union  said .  The U.K.  Office of Fair Trading  is “best placed to examine
the case,” the Brussels-based European Commission, which
handles merger probes for the 27-nation EU,  said  in a decision
published on its website today.  The London-based OFT was already aware of the EU’s decision
and on April 12 began seeking third-party comments on the deal,
spokesman Frank Shepherd said in an interview today. The U.K.
watchdog plans to make a decision by June 16.  Premier, based in St. Albans,  England , proposed the sale on
Feb. 8, saying in a statement the canned-food business wasn’t
“an area of focus” and that cash proceeds would be used to pay
debt. The unit had sales last year of 334 million pounds and
employs about 1,600 people at two plants and two warehouses in
the U.K., the company said.  Premier Foods spokesman Tom Eckersley didn’t immediately
comment when reached today by phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
