Yields on Brazilian interest-rate
futures contracts rose after central bank President Alexandre Tombini said he would increase  interest rates  for as long as
needed to tame inflation.  Yields on the futures contract due in January 2012, the
most actively traded today in Sao Paulo, rose four basis points,
or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.36 percent at 9:22 a.m. in  New
York . The contract due in January 2013 rose three basis points
to 12.69 percent.  Tombini yesterday pledged in an interview with Globo News
TV that policy makers will raise interest rates for as long as
needed to bring inflation back to their target next year.  “It’s not a 100-meter sprint, it’s a long process” he
said. “Obviously, the monetary policy instrument that will get
inflation back to its 4.5 percent target in 2012 is the
conventional instrument that is being used, and will continue to
be used for as long as necessary.”  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is relying on a
mix of higher borrowing costs, measures to curb credit growth
and spending cuts to bring the fastest inflation in 29 months
back to policy makers’ target in 2012. Tombini said interest
rates remain the favored tool for fighting inflation.  “It seems that the central bank maybe won’t use
macroprudential measures as much and will rely more on interest-
rate increases,” said  Newton Rosa , chief-economist at Sul
America Investimentos, in a telephone interview from Sao Paulo.  The real advanced 0.1 percent to 1.5857 per dollar, from
1.5876 yesterday.  To contact the reporters on this story:
