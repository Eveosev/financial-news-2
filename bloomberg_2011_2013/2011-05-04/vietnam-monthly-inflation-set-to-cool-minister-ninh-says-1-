Vietnam ’s monthly inflation rate will
“cool” this month compared with April as the government’s
monetary tightening measures take effect, said Finance Minister
Vu Van Ninh.  “Right now we have to be more determined in carrying out
our planned measures to fight inflation,” Ninh told reporters
while attending an Asian Development Bank meeting in Hanoi. Ninh
said June’s monthly inflation rate may slow further.  The Vietnamese government has boosted  interest rates  and
cut the country’s target for credit growth in an effort to
contain consumer prices. The central bank today increased its
repurchase rate to 14 percent from 13 percent. The rate has now
doubled since November.  Vietnam’s monthly inflation rate in April was 3.32 percent,
the fastest since 2008. The country’s year-on-year inflation
rate in April reached 17.51 percent, also the fastest since 2008.  The nation’s year-on-year inflation rate may accelerate
until the second half, said  Ayumi Konishi , the ADB’s Vietnam
country director, on May 2. The full-year inflation rate may be
about 11.75 percent, according to Minister of Planning and
Investment Vo Hong Phuc, who said yesterday the government is
prioritizing the fight against inflation over encouraging
economic growth.  “I was very encouraged to hear yesterday the government
saying that even if it is at the cost of growth, they will fight
inflation to ensure macroeconomic stability,” ADB Managing
Director Rajat Nag told journalists today in Hanoi.  To contact the reporter on this story:
