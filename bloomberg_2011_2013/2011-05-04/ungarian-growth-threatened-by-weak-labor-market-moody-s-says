Hungarian labor-market weaknesses make
the government’s targets for economic growth “very difficult”
to reach, said  Anthony Thomas , a senior sovereign risk analyst
at Moody’s Investors Service.  “The thing which concerns us more than anything is the
poor demographics,” Thomas said in an interview in  Prague 
today. “If you look at the labor market, it’s a shrinking
population, the participation rate is low, so in terms of
generating strong growth it’s just very difficult to see where
that’s going to come from.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
