Mapfre SA (MAP)  rose in Madrid trading after
the Spanish insurer reported a 14 percent increase in first-
quarter profit, helped by international growth.  Mapfre posted net income of 310.1 million euros ($461
million) in the period, according to a regulatory filing today.
The shares climbed as much as 2.6 percent as profit beat the
average estimate of 241 million euros in a Bloomberg survey of
four analysts.  Total premiums gained 3.7 percent to 5.12 billion euros,
increasing 21 percent in the Mapfre America business that
includes  Brazil , and 7.1 percent in Mapfre International, which
includes Turkey and the U.S. Costs tied to the earthquakes in
 Japan  and  New Zealand  amounted to 64.1 million euros, the
Madrid-based company said.  The insurer also said its board approved a plan allowing
investors to reinvest part of a complementary dividend of 8
cents a share in new stock.  Mapfre shares climbed as much as 7 cents to 2.87 euros and
traded at 2.85 euros as of 11:50 a.m. local time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
