China  has failed to deliver on pledges
made to the U.S. to guarantee equitable treatment of foreign
investors, creating “real frustrations,” Commerce Secretary
Gary Locke said.  Locke, who is waiting for Senate confirmation to be the
next U.S. ambassador in Beijing, said China pledged twice in the
past two years to lift restrictions on foreign investments in
industries where U.S. companies hold a competitive advantage.  A recently issued regulation “falls far short of that
promise,” Locke said in a speech in  Washington  today. “There
are real frustrations within this administration and among
business and congressional leaders about the commercial
environment in China.”  China, the world’s second-largest economy, is the second-
biggest U.S. trading partner after  Canada . Its record trade
surplus with the U.S. has prompted complaints from lawmakers
including Representative Sander Levin, a Michigan Democrat, that
China has unfair trade and currency policies.  In addition to the foreign-investment rules, China has
failed to live up to pledges to publish drafts of regulations
and to crack down on the theft of copyrighted and trademarked
goods, Locke said.  Locke spoke at a conference at the Woodrow Wilson Center in
Washington on the growing investment in the U.S. by Chinese
companies. That investment doubled in each of the past two years
to $5 billion in 2010, and is set to increase at that same rate
in the future, according to the report’s author, Dan Rosen,
principal with the Rhodium Group, a New York-based economic
research firm that specializes in China.  Technology Transfer  “What we see is China moving up the value chain and closer
to the customer,” Rosen said today. He said the U.S. should do
more to attract investment from China, saying it will aid the
economy and boost jobs.  While Chinese investment is growing, representatives of
U.S. companies say they are increasingly troubled by rules in
China that force the transfer of technology to Chinese
counterparts as the price for access to that market.  “The state capitalist approach is increasingly resulting
in discrimination against U.S. goods and services and is putting
our companies at a competitive disadvantage,” business groups
including the  National Foreign Trade Council  and the U.S.
Chamber of Commerce said in a letter to Michael Froman,
President  Barack Obama ’s deputy national security adviser, on
April 15.  U.S. business groups and lawyers discussed how to impose
new restrictions on state-tied companies at an event hosted by
the Chamber of Commerce in Washington yesterday.  “The U.S. government needs to seriously evaluate the
national-security implications of these policies,” said James McGregor, senior counselor in China for  APCO Worldwide , a
public-affairs consulting firm.  Editors: Larry Liebert, Nerys Avery  To contact the reporter on this story:
