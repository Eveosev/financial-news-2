Mashery Inc ., which helps companies
manage relationships with independent Web developers, said it
raised $11 million from investors including  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO) ,
to help it expand and hire more workers.  The investment round was led by OpenView Venture Partners,
Chief Executive Officer Oren Michels said in an interview. The
San Francisco-based company plans to disclose the investment in
a filing with regulators in the next week or so, he said.  Mashery works with companies including Best Buy Co.,  New
York Times Co. (NYT)  and  Netflix Inc. (NFLX)  to reach consumers through
smartphones, tablet computers and televisions. By expanding
beyond the Web browser, Mashery helps businesses connect with an
increasing number of consumers accessing movies, reading news
and buying products across a variety of Internet-connected
devices.  “We’ve now entered the post-website era,” Michels said.
“Customers need to interact with you whenever and wherever. We
take a company that does business on the Web and help them
create new experiences to grow their business.”  Mashery, started in 2006, will use the money to hire
engineering, sales and marketing employees, Michels said.
Existing investors  .406 Ventures , Formative Ventures and First
Round Capital also joined the round. Mashery has raised about
$25 million in total.  To contact the reporter on this story:
