German 10-year  government bonds  rose
before a report economists said would show European services and
manufacturing industriesâ€™ growth stalled last month, weakening
the case for higher  interest rates .  Two-year note yields stayed near the highest in almost
three weeks. A composite index based on a survey of euro-area
purchasing managers in both industries stayed at 57.8 last
month, London-based Markit Economics will say today, according
to the median prediction of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
News. A government report tomorrow will probably show that
German factory orders rose at a slower pace in March, according
to a separate Bloomberg survey.  The yield on the 10-year bund declined two basis points to
3.26 percent as of 7:28 a.m. in  London . The 3.25 percent
security due July 2021 gained 0.15, or 1.5 euros per 1,000 euro
($1,481) face amount, to 99.895. The two-year yield was at 1.88
percent, the most since April 15.  German government bonds have handed investors a loss of 1.8
percent this year, according to indexes compiled by the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies and Bloomberg, while
Treasuries have returned 1.4 percent. Spanish bonds made 2.7
percent while Portuguese debt lost 15 percent.  Portugal  yesterday reached an agreement with officials
preparing its European Union-led bailout that will provide as
much as 78 billion euros in aid and allow more time to reduce
its  budget deficit .  To contact the reporters on this story:
