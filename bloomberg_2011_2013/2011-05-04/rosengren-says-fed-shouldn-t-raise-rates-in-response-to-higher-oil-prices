Federal Reserve  Bank of Boston
President  Eric Rosengren  said record stimulus is necessary to
spur the “anemic” economy and that raising interest rates to
combat increasing food and fuel prices would impede growth.  “With significant slack in labor markets, stable inflation
expectations, and core inflation well below our longer run
target, there is currently no reason to slow the economy down
with tighter monetary policy,” Rosengren said today in a speech
in Boston. “Until we make more progress on both elements of the
Federal Reserve’s mandate -- employment and inflation -- the
current, accommodative stance of monetary policy is
appropriate.”  Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  and the  Federal Open Market
Committee  said last week that they will complete a $600 billion
bond purchase program in June and hold  interest rates  low for an
“extended period,” while noting that rising commodity prices
will probably have only a “transitory” inflationary impact.  “Unemployment remains quite elevated, at 8.8 percent, and
I anticipate a slower return to full employment than we would
have experienced absent these supply shocks,” Rosengren said in
a speech to NAOIP, the Commercial Real Estate Development
Association.  The recovery has been “undesirably slow and anemic,”
Rosengren said, adding that he expects “only a gradual return
of core and total inflation rates to something like our
consensus ‘stable’ rate of about 2 percent, over the medium
term.”  Price of Gasoline  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index, which tracks
a basket of 24 commodities, has risen 26 percent in the past six
months. Most visibly, the national average price of gasoline
rose to $3.97 per gallon on May 2, according to the American
Automobile Association, up from $2.80 six months ago. Prices are
approaching the record level of $4.11, reached in July 2008.  The Fed’s preferred gauge of inflation, the personal
consumption expenditures index, excluding food and fuel, rose
0.9 percent in March, according to the  Department of Commerce . A
separate gauge of  core inflation  compiled by the Department of
Labor, the  consumer price index  excluding food and fuel, rose
1.2 percent in March.  “Tightening monetary policy solely in response to
contractionary supply shocks would likely make the impact of the
shocks worse for households and businesses,” Rosengren said.
“Tighter U.S. monetary policy will do nothing to stabilize
Libyan oil production, reduce uncertainty about political
stability in the rest of the Middle East, or increase the wheat
harvest in  Russia .”  Reduced Growth Rate  Rosengren cited work by the Boston Fed that suggests a $20
increase in the price of a barrel of oil would reduce the rate
of economic growth over two years by 0.4 percentage point and
push up unemployment by 0.2 percentage point.  “While this is certainly not enough to completely stop the
recovery, it does imply a slowing down of its pace,” Rosengren
said.  On the  New York  Mercantile Exchange, crude oil for June
delivery declined 1.9 percent to $108.98 a barrel. Yesterday, it
decreased $2.47, or 2.2 percent, to $111.05, the biggest drop
since April 18.  “Over the past 25 years most supply shocks have been
transitory -- and have had no long-lasting imprint on longer
term inflation, or on inflation expectations,” he said, also
noting that overall prices tend to move toward core prices.  Record Levels  Rosengren said in response to audience questions that the
expansion of the Fed’s balance sheet to record levels isn’t
responsible for commodity-price inflation.  “It is very hard for reserves to translate into inflation
unless you see bank lending expanding quite rapidly,” he said,
noting that wages have not begun to rise rapidly. “The lending
data still remains quite weak.”  “If expectations of inflation do rise in response to the
supply shock, then nominal wages and salaries across the economy
will be pressured to increase over time to keep pace,”
Rosengren said.  Currently, he said, there’s no evidence that potential
inflation concerns are placing upward pressure on wages and
salaries. He also said high unemployment is primarily a result
of weak demand rather than a structural change in the economy,
Rosengren said.  ‘Across the Board’  “What’s different about this recession is it’s across the
board in all industries,” he said in response to audience
questions. “There are some structural elements but by and large
we’re assuming most of it is actually demand.”  Companies in the U.S. added workers in April, signaling the
labor market is strengthening, data from a private report based
on payrolls showed today. Employment increased by 179,000,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services, lower than the
198,000 median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  The Labor Department will report May 6 that the economy
added 185,000 jobs in April, according to the median estimate of
a separate Bloomberg survey. The  unemployment rate  will remain
unchanged at 8.8 percent, and average hourly earnings will have
risen 1.8 percent from a year earlier, according to the survey.  U.S. stocks fell while 10-year Treasuries rallied for a
fifth straight day. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index lost 0.9
percent to 1,344.81 at 12:14 p.m. in New York. Ten-year Treasury
yields decreased three basis points to 3.22 percent.  “Recent historical trends do not always continue,”
Rosengren said. The  Boston  Fed chief is “committed to
responding decisively, and as forcefully as necessary” should
long-term inflation expectations begin to rise or commodity
price increases start to spur inflation.  Rosengren, 53, joined the Boston Fed as an economist in
1985, and became the bank’s president in 2007.  Fed presidents 
rotate voting on monetary policy, with Rosengren next voting in
2013.  To contact the reporter on this story:
