Oil declined for a fourth day in  New
York , the longest losing streak in eight weeks, as a drop in
gasoline demand added to signs of slowing growth in the U.S.,
the world’s biggest crude consumer.  Futures fell as much as 0.7 percent after the Energy
Department said yesterday that crude stockpiles climbed to the
highest since October and gasoline consumption slipped to a
four-week low. Separate reports showed a slower-than-forecast
expansion in U.S. service industries and employment.  “The data is signaling that the recovery isn’t as rapid as
some were expecting,” said  Ben Westmore , a minerals and energy
economist at National Australia Bank Ltd. in Melbourne, who
predicted oil will average $113 a barrel in the third quarter.
“It’s going to be a slow grind back for the U.S.”  Crude for June delivery lost as much as 81 cents to $108.43
a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . The contract was at $108.76 at 2:22 p.m. Singapore
time. Yesterday, it slid $1.81, or 1.6 percent, to $109.24, the
lowest since April 19. Prices, which decreased for four days
through March 11, have gained 36 percent in the past year.  Brent crude  for June settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange fell as much as 70 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $120.49 a barrel. Yesterday, the contract lost 1
percent to $121.19, the lowest since April 12.  Gasoline Demand  A measure of U.S. gasoline consumption dropped 2.2 percent
to 8.94 million barrels a day in the week ended April 29,
according to the Energy Department. Stockpiles decreased 1.05
million barrels to 204.5 million, declining for an 11th week,
the longest stretch of declines in four years. Supplies were
forecast to fall 500,000 barrels, based on the median estimate
from 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Crude inventories rose 3.42 million barrels to 366.5
million last week, the highest since October, the Energy
Department said. Stockpiles at Cushing,  Oklahoma , the delivery
point for the New York-traded West Texas Intermediate grade,
increased 102,000 barrels, the most in a month.  “The overnight data reports raised doubts over the
strength of the U.S. recovery,”  Mark Pervan , head of commodity
research at Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. in
Melbourne, said in an e-mailed note today. “Coupled with
another 3.4 million-barrel rise in U.S. crude stockpiles, price
trends could remain soft.”  Oil-options volatility fell for the first day in three. The
most active oil-options contracts in electronic trading were
$105-a-barrel puts for June 2011, with 3,360 lots changing
hands. Those gained 23 cents to 82 cents a barrel. $115 calls
for June, the next-most active option, fell 54 cents to 51 cents
a barrel. One contract covers 1,000 barrels.  Bollinger Band  Crude in New York today briefly traded below a technical
indicator that signals prices may extend losses. Front-month
futures at $108.80 a barrel are near the middle Bollinger Band
on the daily chart, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Oil
has climbed above that indicator since late February, when
protests against Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  disrupted
supplies from the country.  Futures have rallied 19 percent this year as unrest in the
Middle East and North Africa toppled leaders in Egypt and
Tunisia and spread to  Libya ,  Algeria ,  Bahrain ,  Iran , Oman, Syria
and Yemen. Forces loyal to Qaddafi attacked rebel-held cities in
the country’s west as ministers from 22 nations prepared to meet
in  Rome  today to discuss ways to end the fighting.  Oil also declined after U.S. companies added fewer jobs and
service companies expanded less than forecast.  Employment rose 179,000 in April, according to ADP Employer
Services, less than a median estimate of 198,000 from economists
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Labor Department data tomorrow may
show payrolls increased by 185,000 workers last month after
216,000 a month earlier, a separate poll showed.  The Institute for Supply Management’s index of non-
manufacturing companies slumped to 52.8 in April, the lowest
level since August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
