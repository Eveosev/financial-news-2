Asia Debt Management Capital of  Hong
Kong , PGGM NV and the World Bank’s International Finance Corp.
agreed to invest $140 million for a 26 percent stake in Turkish
hospital chain  Universal Saglik Yatirimlari Holding AS .  Universal, which runs 18 hospitals in 12 cities, will use
the proceeds to invest in more sites in  Turkey , especially in
smaller towns, Chairman Azmi Ofluoglu said in an e-mailed
 statement  from the four companies. They didn’t say how much of a
stake each of the buyers will acquire. Istanbul-based  Daruma
Corporate Finance  advised the seller in the deal, they said.  Turkey’s economic growth is attracting investors in the
country’s burgeoning health-care industry. The economy expanded
8.9 percent last year, the fastest pace since 2005, and may grow
4.6 percent this year, according to April 11 estimates from the
Washington-based  International Monetary Fund .  Abraaj Capital Ltd., the Middle East’s biggest private
equity firm, bought 54 percent of hospital operator Acibadem
Saglik Hizmetleri & Ticaret AS for about $606 million in 2007
and 2008.  Carlyle Group , the world’s second-biggest private
equity firm, bought 40 percent of hospital operator Medical Park
Saglik Grubu AS for an undisclosed price in 2009. Argus Capital
Partners and Qatar First Investment Bank last year purchased 40
percent of hospital chain Memorial Health Group.  To contact the reporter on this story:
