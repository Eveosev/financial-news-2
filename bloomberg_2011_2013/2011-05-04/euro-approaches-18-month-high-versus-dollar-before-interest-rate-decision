The yen and franc gained against most
major counterparts, with the Swiss currency touching a record
high against the dollar, as a drop in commodities and stocks
damped appetite for higher-yielding assets.  The euro reached its strongest in 17 months versus the
dollar on speculation European Central Bank President Jean- Claude Trichet will signal further interest-rate boosts after a
policy meeting tomorrow. New Zealand’s dollar and  Brazil ’s real
were the worst-performing major currencies. The Dollar Index
touched the lowest since 2008 on weaker-than-forecast data and
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will maintain economic stimulus.  “Those safe havens, the yen and the Swiss franc, are much
stronger,” said  Brian Dolan , chief strategist at FOREX.com, a
unit of online currency trading firm Gain Capital in Bedminster,
 New Jersey . “It’s a risk liquidation taking place.”  The yen appreciated 0.4 percent to 80.61 per dollar at 5
p.m. in New York after earlier touching 80.44, the strongest
since March 18. The franc strengthened to a record 85.54
centimes per dollar before trading at 86.22 centimes.  The euro was little changed at $1.4827, compared with
$1.4825 yesterday. It touched $1.4940, the highest level since
it reached $1.5091 on Dec. 4, 2009. The shared currency dropped
0.4 percent to 119.55 yen, from 119.99.  Strongest Since Intervention  The yen’s strongest level of the day was the most versus
the dollar since the Group of Seven nations jointly intervened
in the  currency market  in an effort to weaken the Japanese
currency. Central banks intervene by buying or selling
currencies. The yen had advanced to a post World War II high of
76.25 per dollar after the country’s worst earthquake on record.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent and the
Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of raw materials slid 1.8
percent. Crude oil for June delivery lost as much as 2.3 percent
to $108.48 a barrel in New York, its lowest in two weeks.  The Canadian dollar fell for a third day against its U.S.
counterpart, the longest losing streak since March, as crude oil
dropped. The commodity is  Canada ’s biggest export. The currency
traded at 95.91 U.S. cents, down 0.7 percent.  New Zealand ’s dollar, nicknamed the kiwi, weakened after
 Statistics New Zealand  said permanent migrant departures
exceeded arrivals by 530 in March, the most since a net 2,400 in
February 2001. The nation produces commodities for export.  The kiwi slid 1.1 percent to 78.99 U.S. cents after
touching 78.66, the lowest level since April 19. It tumbled as
much as 1.9 percent to 63.39 yen, the weakest since April 1.  Brazil’s Real  The Brazilian real weakened as much as 2 percent to 1.6189
per dollar, the lowest since April 1. Brazil’s tax increase on
foreign loans and debt sales helped reduce by 88 percent the
number of dollars that entered the country last month, according
to central bank data published today.  The dollar dropped to the lowest in almost three years
against the currencies of six major trade partners as the
 Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-manufacturing
companies fell to 52.8 in April. The measure of the service
industry, which accounts for about 90 percent of the economy,
was 57.3 in March, and economists in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast a reading of 57.5 this month.  “It postpones the day of reckoning for the Fed and the
normalization of interest rates,” said  Michael Woolfolk , senior
currency strategist in New York at Bank of New York Mellon
Corp., the world’s largest custodial bank, with more than $20
trillion in assets under administration. “It pushes rate hikes
further into the future.”  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, used to track
the greenback against the euro, yen, pound and three other
currencies, dropped as much as 0.6 percent to 72.696, the lowest
level since July 2008. It later was at 73.116.  U.S. Employment  ADP Employer Services data showed employment at U.S.
companies increased by 179,000 jobs in April, compared with a
revised 207,000 in March. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
News survey called for a 198,000 advance this month.  The ECB raised its benchmark interest rate to 1.25 percent
on April 7 from a record low 1 percent. Some economists expect
it to signal tomorrow another boost will come as soon as June.  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said last week after a policy
meeting he was unsure when the U.S. central bank’s monetary
stimulus will unwind. The benchmark U.S. rate has been zero to
0.25 percent since December 2008 to support the economy. The
Fed’s program to spur growth by purchasing $600 billion in
Treasuries will end in June, as planned, policy makers decided.  ‘Anemic’ Economy  Boston  Fed President  Eric Rosengren  said today in a speech
in Boston that record stimulus is necessary to spur the
“anemic”  U.S. economy  and that raising interest rates to
combat increasing food and fuel prices would impede growth.  The euro rose earlier as a composite index of European
services and manufacturing rose to 57.8 in April, led by factory
output, a report showed.  Pacific Investment Management Co., which runs the world’s
biggest mutual fund, said it’s betting the euro will fall
because its current strength doesn’t adequately reflect the risk
that the union may disintegrate.  The Newport Beach, California-based firm is buying
currencies of countries that have strong growth, low levels of
debt, and where central banks are tightening monetary policy,
such as  Australia ,  Singapore ,  South Korea  and  Sweden , Thomas Kressin, head of European foreign exchange at Pimco in Munich,
said in an interview yesterday.  The yen gained the most today among 10 developed-nation
currencies measured by the Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted
Currency Indexes, rising 0.9 percent. New Zealand’s dollar lost
0.9 percent for the worst performance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
