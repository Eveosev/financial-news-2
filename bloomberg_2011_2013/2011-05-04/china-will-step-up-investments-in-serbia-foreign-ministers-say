China  will encourage its companies to
expand infrastructure investments in Serbia, the country’s
Foreign Ministry Yang Jiechi said during a visit to Belgrade.  “China is ready to take part in development of major
infrastructure projects in Serbia” including roads and bridges,
following last year’s agreement with the Balkan country for
Chinese CRBC International Co. to build a 170 million-euro ($252
million) bridge across the Danube River near Belgrade, said Vuk
Jeremic, Serbia’s Foreign Minister after meeting with Jiechi.  Chinese President  Hu Jintao  is expected to visit Serbia,
Jiechi and Jeremic also said, without specifying when.  To contact the reporter on this story:
