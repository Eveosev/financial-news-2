Clarkson Plc (CKN) , the worldâ€™s biggest
shipbroker, established a capital markets and energy banking
team focused on the U.S.  The new energy team will be led by  James Bell  and  Robert
Parker , Clarkson said in an e-mailed statement today. Both men
previously worked at I-Bankers Securities Inc., an investment
bank based in Los Angeles, it said.  The hirings will bring a new Clarkson office in New York,
expanding its investment banking operations in Dubai, London and
Houston, the company said. The London-based company said in
March it would hire more brokers this year to take share from
rivals as freight markets slump.  The Baltic Dry Index, an overall measure of raw-materials
transportation costs, has declined 61 percent in the past 12
months while earnings for supertanker owners on the benchmark
Saudi Arabia-to-Japan route have collapsed 99 percent in the
same period.  -- Editors: Sharon Lindores, Claudia Carpenter  To contact the reporter on this story:
