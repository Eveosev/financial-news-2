The operator of  Sweden ’s H&M clothing
chain said there was “no basis” to speculation it would bid
for  Gap Inc. (GPS)  after bets on a potential takeover lifted the
apparel chain’s call-options volume to a seven-month high.  Almost 49,000 calls to buy the stock changed hands as of
12:05 p.m. in  New York , 21 times the full-day average during the
past four weeks and 11 times the number of puts to sell. The
shares rose as much as 3.5 percent to $23.73, the highest
intraday level in a year. The most-active contracts were May $25
calls, which jumped 109 percent to 23 cents for the biggest gain
among all Gap options and accounted for almost a third of call
volume.  Traders are betting that H&M’s Stockholm-based parent,
 Hennes & Mauritz AB (HMB) , may bid for the largest U.S. apparel chain,
said Jamie Lissette, founder of Hammerstone Group, a Westport,
Connecticut-based operator of online discussion  forums  for
investors.  “I can say there’s no basis for this rumor,” said Haacan
Andersson, an H&M spokesman. Louise Callagy, a spokeswoman for
Gap, said the San Francisco-based company doesn’t comment on
rumors or speculation.  Gap’s May $25 calls were today’s 11th most-active contracts
on all U.S. options exchanges, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. The option had an open interest of 34 outstanding
contracts before today.  To contact the reporters on this story:
