National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the
nation’s best-performing bank stock this year, said first-half
profit rose 16 percent as it won mortgage customers and boosted
fees from business banking.  Net income advanced to A$2.43 billion ($2.61 billion) in
the six months ended March 31 from A$2.1 billion a year earlier,
the Melbourne-based bank said in a statement today. Profit at
the retail banking unit, which boosted its share of Australia’s
mortgage lending market even as total demand cooled, surged 36.3
percent.  The shares gained the most since February after Chief
Executive Officer Cameron Clyne snared home loan customers from
rivals with fee cuts and lower  interest rates , while waiting for
a pickup in business lending.  Westpac Banking Corp. (WBC)  and
 Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. (ANZ)  posted earnings that
fell short of analysts’ estimates.  “They seem to be tracking reasonably well compared with
the other banks,” said Sean Fenton, who helps manage about $1.1
billion at Tribeca Investment Partners in Sydney, including
shares in Australia’s four biggest banks. The push to win extra
mortgage market share is “not hurting them so it’s probably
worth doing. They’ve got to wait and see if they get scale,” he
said.  National Australia shares rose 2.4 percent, the first gain
in three days, to A$27.01 as of the 4:10 p.m. close in Sydney,
taking this year’s gain to 14 percent. The country’s benchmark
S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.3 percent today. Westpac has advanced
6.8 percent this year,  Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  added 3.7
percent and ANZ Bank has climbed 1 percent.  Credit Rebound  “We’re seeing the early signs of business credit
rebounding and we expect that to be stronger towards the end of
this calendar year,” Clyne said in a briefing with reporters
today in Sydney. “Whilst recognizing there are some headwinds
out there, we’re still broadly positive” on the outlook for the
economy, he said.  Business loans increased 1 percent in March from the
previous month, the biggest increase since October 2008, the
 Reserve Bank  of Australia said April 29.  Westpac said yesterday that first-half cash profit rose 7
percent to A$3.17 billion in the six months ended March 31 from
a year earlier as bad debts fell. ANZ Bank said a day earlier
that net income gained 3 percent to A$2.66 billion from the
previous six months, which missed the A$2.77 billion median
estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  Loan Demand  Demand for mortgages and business loans waned after the
central bank’s seven interest-rate increases from October 2009
to November 2010. Lending to households rose 0.4 percent in
March from the previous month, the smallest gain in nine months,
the RBA’s April 29 report showed.  Central bank Governor Glenn Stevens left the benchmark rate
unchanged at 4.75 percent May 3, citing weaker credit demand.  Profit at National  Australia ’s business bank, which
accounts for 44 percent of cash earnings, rose 7.9 percent in
the fiscal first half from a year earlier. Earnings rose 36.3
percent at its personal banking unit, which boosted its share of
Australia’s mortgage lending market to 13.8 percent from 12.8
percent a year earlier, the bank said today.  National Australia’s overall net interest margin, a measure
of profitability of the bank’s lending business, narrowed to
2.23 percent in the six months to March 31 from 2.24 percent in
the previous six months. In its business lending division, the
margin widened to 2.57 percent from 2.50 percent, while for
retail banking it shrank to 2.22 percent from 2.28 percent six
months ago.  Bad Loans  The impairment charge for bad debts fell 19.7 percent from
a year earlier to A$988 million.  Operating expenses gained 3.4 percent in the six months to
March 31 to A$4 billion from the year-earlier period. Net
operating income advanced 6.8 percent to A$8.8 billion.  “Our revenue growth is significantly stronger than our
cost growth,” Clyne told reporters.  The bank’s Tier 1 capital ratio, a measure of its ability
to absorb potential losses, was 9.19 percent from 8.91 percent
at the end of September. National Australia will pay a dividend
of 84 Australian cents a share for the half.  Net income of A$2.43 billion missed the A$2.64 billion
median estimate of five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter for this story:
