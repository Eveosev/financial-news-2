Spain  has fewer than 700,000 unsold
homes after the market collapsed in 2008, the Transport and
Development Ministry said.  About 61 percent of those are in coastal areas, Deputy
Minister for Housing Beatriz Corredor said at a press conference
in  London  today. Prices in seaside areas have fallen as much as
40 percent from the peak, while on average prices have declined
20 percent in real terms, said Development Minister Jose Blanco,
whose remit includes housing.  The estimate of homes left over from the construction boom
compares with the Bank of Spain’s figure of as many as 1.1
million. Blanco is in London to promote Spain’s economy and
housing market to investors. He will deliver the same message at
meetings in  France ,  Germany , Switzerland, the Netherlands and
Russia.  Blanco said lenders that have taken foreclosed real estate
onto their books are valuing homes “fairly,” at market prices.
Valuing land “may be more problematic,” he said.  Spain built 675,000 homes a year from 1997 to 2006, more
than France, Germany and the U.K. combined, according to a
report by a unit of Spanish savings bank Cajamar.  To contact the reporters on this story:
