Sinopharm Group Co. (1099) , China’s largest
drug distributor, reported first-quarter profit surged 28
percent as its newly acquired distribution businesses in the
country boosted sales.  The company, which last year signed an agreement with U.S.-
based Merck & Co. to distribute its cervical cancer vaccine
Gardasil, posted net income of 401.8 million yuan ($61.8
million), or 0.18 cents per share, for the three months ended
March 31, up from 314.8 million yuan a year ago, according to a
statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  “Most of the increase came from the distribution companies
that Sinopharm bought last year, where the sales are extending
and feeding through to this year,” said Selina Sia, an analyst
at Hong Kong-based Mirae Asset Securities.  China ’s government is implementing a plan to spend 850
billion yuan to expand basic health-care services throughout the
country by this year, and the nation’s medical and healthcare
market is expected to grow to the second largest in the world by
2020, according to IMS Health, a U.S.-based pharmaceutical
market research firm.  Revenue from Sinopharm’s main businesses, which include
drug distribution and retail, jumped 46 percent to 22.3 billion
yuan in the first quarter, compared with 15.3 billion yuan for
the same period a year earlier, it said.  The company will offer 2 billion yuan of three-year bonds
for sale on May 11, according to a separate statement on the
Chinese government bond clearing house website today.  Sinopharm said in January that it plans to spend at least 5
billion yuan buying companies in the next two years, after it
spent the same amount acquiring more than 60 companies since
going public in September 2009. It has targeted 100 billion yuan
in annual sales by 2012, after reporting 69 billion yuan last
year, a 31 percent rise from 2009.  For Related News and Information:  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
