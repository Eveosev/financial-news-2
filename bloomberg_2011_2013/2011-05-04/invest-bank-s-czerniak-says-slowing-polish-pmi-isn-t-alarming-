A slowing in the growth in Polish
manufacturing isn’t “alarming” and will have no impact on the
central bank’s rate decision due next week, said Adam Czerniak,
an economist at Invest-Bank in Warsaw.  The purchasing managers’ index compiled for HSBC by Markit,
a financial information services company, unexpectedly fell to
54.4 percent in April from 54.8 a month ago. The median estimate
of economists polled by Bloomberg was for a reading of 55.  Czerniak spoke in a phone interview today.  “This slight drop has no major importance and should not
be interpreted as weakening market sentiment as it is probably
related with the end of increased Easter orders in the food
sector.  “There is no alarming trend in the economy, what we can
see is an adjustment of sentiment indexes.  “The data will have no impact on the Monetary Policy
Council’s decision, which puts now more attention to inflation
and inflationary expectations.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
