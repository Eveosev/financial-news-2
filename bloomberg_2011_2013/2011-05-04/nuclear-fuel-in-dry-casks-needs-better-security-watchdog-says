U.S. regulators need to improve the
security for used nuclear fuel stored in steel and concrete
containers, a government watchdog said in a report.  The  Nuclear Regulatory Commission  has no central database
of security-related information for so-called dry cask storage,
and doesn’t have a comprehensive document outlining the roles
and responsibilities of staff, according to a report by the
agency’s inspector general. Regional offices also use different
groups of employees to monitor dry-cask installations, so there
is no forum for communication, the report said.  “This could negatively impact NRC’s mission to ensure
adequate protection of public health and safety, promote the
common defense and security, and protect the environment,”
according to the report, released in an e-mail today by the NRC.  A White House  commission  is studying alternatives to the
storage of commercial nuclear waste after President Barack
Obama’s administration scrapped plans for a central repository
at Yucca Mountain in  Nevada . Used reactor fuel is stored in dry
casks at 57 U.S. sites, the May 3 report said. Of those, 47 were
at operating reactors.  To contact the reporter on this story:
