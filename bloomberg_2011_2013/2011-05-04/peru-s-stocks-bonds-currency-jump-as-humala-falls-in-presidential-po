Peru ’s bonds and currency surged, and
stocks rose the most in more than 2 1/2 years, after a
presidential poll showed declining support for former military
rebel Ollanta Humala.  The Lima General Index of stocks jumped 6.1 percent to
20,678.38, the biggest one-day rise since November 2008 and the
best performance of 90 primary indices tracked by Bloomberg.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Peruvian dollar
bonds instead of U.S. Treasuries fell 17 basis points to 1.99
percentage point, the steepest decline in four months, according
to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Humala, the leader of Peru’s Nationalist Party who pledges
to increase state control of the economy, had 39 percent support
and Congresswoman Keiko Fujimori had 38 percent support in a
poll taken April 23-30 by Lima-based Ipsos Apoyo. Humala had 42
percent and Fujimori had 36 percent in Ipsos Apoyo’s April 16-21
survey.  “Markets are particularly focused on the skew of the
electoral polls,” said  Enrique Alvarez , head of Latin America
fixed-income research at IDEAglobal in  New York . “There’s added
hopes that the run-off result doesn’t bring the Nationalist
candidate into office.”  Peru’s sol jumped 0.3 percent to 2.8195 per  U.S. dollar ,
the best performance among 25 emerging market currencies tracked
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
