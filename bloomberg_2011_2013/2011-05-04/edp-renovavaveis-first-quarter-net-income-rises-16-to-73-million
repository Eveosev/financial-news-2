EDP Renovaveis SA (EDPR) , the renewable-
energy unit of Portuguese utility EDP-Energias de Portugal SA,
said first-quarter profit rose 16 percent as it added capacity
and electricity output increased.  Net income climbed to 49 million euros ($73 million) from
43 million euros a year earlier, the arm of Lisbon-based EDP
said today in a regulatory filing. Revenue rose 17 percent to
284 million euros.  EDP Renovaveis is expanding its wind projects from  Europe 
to the U.S., tapping government support for alternative energy
development. EDP, which bought Horizon Wind Energy LLC of Texas
from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. in 2007, says it’s the world’s
third-biggest wind-park operator.  The EDP unit installed 1.2 gigawatts of capacity in the 12
months through March. The company in November said it’s
adjusting the planned annual capacity additions for 2011 and
2012 to 0.8 gigawatts to 0.9 gigawatts a year. Installed
capacity grew to 6,864 megawatts at the end of March.  Financial costs increased to 38 million euros from 30
million euros a year earlier as net debt increased to 3.1
billion euros from 2.8 billion euros at the end of December.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization are forecast to rise at an average annual pace of
about 30 percent from 2009 through 2012, according to a
presentation in May. Ebitda climbed 19 percent to 220 million
euros in the first quarter as electricity output gained 21
percent.  EDP Renovaveis shares gained 0.3 percent to 5.20 euros
today, bringing their increase this year to 20 percent, valuing
the company at 4.53 billion euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
