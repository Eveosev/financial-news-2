Rand Merchant Bank  said its coal
exchange-traded notes will list on Johannesburg’s bourse
tomorrow to expand trade in the commodity.  This gives people the opportunity to invest in 1 metric ton
of coal, “making the product more accessible and easier to
invest in than directly into a futures contract, which typically
trades at 5,000 tons of coal,” Vicki Goodwin, a Johannesburg-
based spokeswoman, said in an e-mailed statement today.  The contracts will be settled against the price of coal
exported from Richards Bay, South Africa, site of the
continent’s biggest facility for shipping the fuel. Prices at
the port have risen about 45 percent in the past 12 months,
according to data from IHS McCloskey, a Petersfield, England-
based researcher. The port, traditionally a supplier to  Europe ,
has increasingly garnered Asian business.  India ’s imports of coal from  South Africa  rose 8 percent in
the year ending March 2011, accounting for about 32 percent of
the African nation’s exports, according to data from mjunction
Services Ltd., an ecommerce company based in India. Overall the
terminal on South Africa’s eastern coast exported 5.36 million
metric tons during the month, compared with 5.66 million tons a
year ago, it said last month.  The RMB Coal ETN is the company’s second commodity note, it
said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
