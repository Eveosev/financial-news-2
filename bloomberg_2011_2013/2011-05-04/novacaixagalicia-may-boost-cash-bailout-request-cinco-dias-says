Novacaixagalicia, a Spanish savings
bank group, may increase the amount requested from the bank
rescue fund created by the Spanish government,  Cinco Dias 
reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The increased demand follows lower than forecast bid prices
on a planned sale of 300 branches by the lender, Cinco Dias
said. Novacaixagalicia initially forecast it would raise between
650 million euros ($962 million) and 1 billion euros from
operations including asset sales, Cinco Dias said. The lender
has now reduced its target to 500 million euros, the newspaper
reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
