Greek Finance Minister  George Papaconstantinou  said claims for back pay and pension benefits
by a group of former lawmakers were an “insult” and wouldn’t
be considered.  “The demand for back pay of pensions or salaries is an
insult to a sense of justice, particularly at this particular
time for the economy,” Papaconstantinou said in an e-mailed
statement from the Athens-based ministry. “The ministry won’t
meet any such demand and will take all necessary action in this
direction.”  The group of about 800 former lawmakers, who sat in
Greece’s parliament between 2003 and 2008, are claiming 80
million euros ($119 million) in back pay and benefits,
Kathimerini reported today, citing a court official. They are
basing their claim on a 2008 law that members of parliament
should be paid the same as the country’s top judges, the Athens-
based newspaper said.  Greece ’s economy has been hurt by government cuts to wages
and pensions and tax increases aimed at narrowing a  budget
deficit  that reached 15.4 percent of gross domestic product in
2009. While Parliament voted for the pay rises not to come into
effect, the former lawmakers are claiming they are not bound by
this decision as they are no longer MPs, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
