Talisman Energy Inc. (TLM)  fell the most in
two years after the Canadian oil and natural-gas producer
reported a first-quarter loss on contracts used to lock in
commodity prices.  The shares declined as much as 7.4 percent, the biggest
intraday drop since April 20, 2009. Talisman, based in Calgary,
was down C$1.56, or 7 percent, to C$20.87 as of 12:02 p.m. on
the Toronto Stock Exchange. The stock has dropped 5.7 percent
this year.  Talisman reported a first-quarter net loss of $326 million,
or 32 cents a share, compared with net income of $371 million in
the year-earlier period, according to a statement today. The
company was expected to earn 31 cents a share, the average of
two analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  The company reported a $320 million loss in the quarter
from hedging the price of oil at $92 to $98 a barrel, Chief
Financial Officer Scott Thomson said during a conference call
with analysts today.  Brent crude  was $117.36 at the end of the
first quarter, he said.  Oil and gas production for the year will be at “the
bottom” of a 5 percent to 10 percent growth range, Chief
Executive Officer John Manzoni said during the call.  The company will see more volatility in its earnings
because it’s now adhering to International Financial Reporting
Standards, Manzoni said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
