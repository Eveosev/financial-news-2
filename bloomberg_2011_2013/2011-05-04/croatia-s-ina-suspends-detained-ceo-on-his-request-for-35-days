Croatian refiner INA Industrija Nafte
d.d.  suspended Chief Executive Officer Bojan Milkovic for 35
days at his request after he was detained on corruption charges,
the Zagreb-based company said.  Zoltan Aldott, the head of the management board at
 Croatia ’s largest refiner, will continue to have the duties of
CEO until a further decision is made, the company said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Milkovic was taken into custody on March 26 and is sitting
in a Zagreb jail pending the probe. The refiner is controlled by
Hungary’s Mol Nyrt, which holds 47.26 percent of the stock. The
Croatian government owns 44.84 percent.  Zelimir Sikonja will remain as interim director of research
and production, the company also said. The company also hopes
allegations against Milkovic will be proven unfounded, it said
in the statement.  Croatia’s  market regulator  on April 28 suspended trade in
INA stock through May 6. It acted “following significant
trading by foreign investors,” and to protect INA’s
shareholders, according to a statement on the watchdog’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
