Ukraine ’s weather for the 2011 grain
harvest is “very favorable,” said Mykola Kulbida, chief of
Ukraine’s hydrometeorology center.  “There are grounds to expect a good harvest, especially of
winter grains,” Kulbida told reporters in Kiev. The weather is
“very favorable” for all grains, he said.  Soil moisture is sufficient for grain crops in all
Ukrainian regions, the meteorologist said. There is a low chance
of the country having hot and dry weather in July and August, as
it did last year, he said.  Ukraine limited its grain exports in October following the
Russian ban of outbound shipments after drought crippled
harvests in both countries. The Ukrainian quotas for wheat and
barley run until the end of June and the government’s decision,
on April 27, to abolish corn export quotas may come into effect
this week.  Temperature for corn planting is favorable in all regions
in Ukraine except in the west and north, where warm temperatures
are expected for several days, or a week at most, Kulbida said.
The Agriculture Ministry expects corn planting to increase 17
percent to 3.2 million hectares.  About 56 percent of Ukraine’s winter grains were in
excellent condition and 38 percent in good condition as of April
28, the Agriculture Ministry said on its website. About 57
percent of winter wheat was in good condition and 38.1 in
satisfactory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
