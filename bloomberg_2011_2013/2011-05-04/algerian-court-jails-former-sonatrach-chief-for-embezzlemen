Mohamed Meziane, former chief
executive officer of  Algeria ’s state-run energy company
Sonatrach, was sentenced to two years in prison, including one
suspended, for embezzlement of public funds.  Abdelhafid Feghouli, who replaced Meziane as an interim
CEO, and was the company’s vice president for downstream
operations, was also sentenced to four months and a year
suspended on similar charges, a judge at the western city of
Oran’s court said. Three other executives connected with the
company were also jailed.  The executives awarded projects to international companies
through direct agreements rather than through bid rounds, which
is a breach of the law, the judge said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
