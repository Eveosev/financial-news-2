The Uganda Law Society said the police
and other security agencies committed alleged “crimes against
humanity” in its dispersion of opposition protests, Bruce
Kyerere, the president of the group, said in a petition to Chief
Justice Benjamin Odoki in the country’s  High Court  today.   Security agencies indiscriminately fired live bullets and
tear gas, killing some and injuring unarmed civilians, and
detained others on flimsy charges, Kyerere said.  The lawyers gathered at the High Court in Kampala and other
courts across the country in protest of the brutal force of the
state, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
