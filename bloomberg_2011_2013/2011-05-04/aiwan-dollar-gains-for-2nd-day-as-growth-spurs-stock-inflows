Taiwan ’s dollar strengthened for a
second day on optimism the island’s growth remains intact after
the government reported gross domestic product that beat
analysts’ estimates.  Taiwan’s economy expanded 6.2 percent in the first quarter
from a year earlier, after a 6.9 percent gain in the previous
three months, official data showed April 29. The median estimate
of economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for 5 percent. The
currency trimmed gains during the final minutes of trading on
suspected intervention by the central bank, according to two
traders who declined to be identified because market operations
aren’t normally disclosed.  “There were big inflows into the  Taiwan dollar  in April
and they are continuing,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income
strategist at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “Taiwan
attracts foreign investors on its stable and solid growth.”  Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.1 percent to NT$28.670 against
its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. close, according to Taipei
Forex Inc. It touched NT$28.508 yesterday, the strongest level
since October 1997. The currency was trading 0.5 percent
stronger at NT$28.562 one minute before the end of trading.  Government bonds  were little changed. The yield on the 1
percent note due January 2016, the most-active government
security, was 1.092 percent, from 1.094 percent yesterday,
according to Gretai Securities Market.  The government will report tomorrow consumer prices rose
1.40 percent from a year earlier in April, after a 1.41 percent
increase the previous month, according to the median estimate of
economists in a Bloomberg survey. Inflation in March was the
slowest among  Asia ’s 10 biggest emerging-market economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
