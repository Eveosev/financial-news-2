Rightmove Plc (RMV) , operator of the U.K.’s
largest residential-property website, said visitors to its site
rose 15 percent in the first quarter, bolstered by cell-phone
applications.  The number of advertisers at the end of March was 0.7
percent higher than in December and growth continued through
April, London-based Rightmove said in a statement today.
Searches on cell-phone applications more than tripled in the
first three months of the year, Rightmove said.  “Subject to there being no further decline in the U.K.
housing market, the board remains confident of meeting its
expectations,” the company said in the statement. Rightmove
will pay a dividend of 9 pence on June 10 to registered
shareholders on May 13.  Rightmove, which is debt-free, restarted a share buyback
program on last August and increased its annual dividend by 40
percent to 14 pence a share as part of a strategy to return cash
to shareholders. The stock has jumped 37 percent this year
through yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
