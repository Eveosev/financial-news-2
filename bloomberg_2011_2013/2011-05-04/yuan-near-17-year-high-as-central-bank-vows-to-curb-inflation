China ’s yuan traded near a 17-year
high after the central bank reiterated its top priority is to
curb the fastest inflation in 32 months.  The People’s Bank of China said yesterday controlling price
increases is its main goal, even after a manufacturing survey
indicated that economic growth may slow. Bank reserve
requirements have no “absolute ceiling,” the central bank said
in its first-quarter monetary policy report published on its
website.  “Even if China’s growth slows down a bit, the economy is
still expanding,” said Patrick Cheng, a foreign-exchange
analyst at Haitong International Securities Co. in Hong Kong.
“The yuan is supported by the expectation that China will
continue its inflation fight and let the currency appreciate.”  The yuan gained 0.05 percent to 6.4933 per dollar as of the
4:30 p.m. close in  Shanghai , according to the China Foreign
Exchange Trade System. The currency touched 6.4892 on April 29,
the strongest level since the country unified official and
market exchange rates at the end of 1993. In Hong Kong’s
offshore market, the yuan fell 0.09 percent to 6.4735 per dollar.  The People’s Bank of China set the yuan’s reference rate
0.02 percent weaker at 6.5013 per dollar. The fixing was 6.4990
on April 29, the strongest level since July 2005.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards were little changed
at 6.3270 per dollar after declining 0.28 percent yesterday, the
most since March 15. The contracts reflected bets the yuan will
strengthen 2.6 percent in a year from the onshore spot rate,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  ‘Substantially Undervalued’  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy F. Geithner  said yesterday
it would help global economies if China allows its
“substantially undervalued” currency to strengthen.  “It would be better for the world, more fair to us, and we
think in China’s interests, to let the  exchange rate  appreciate
more rapidly,” Geithner said at an event held by the U.S.-China
Business Council in  Washington .  Inflation in China was an annual 5.4 percent in March,
exceeding the government’s full-year target of 4 percent for a
third month. China may ask banks to set aside more reserves this
month to soak up yuan they have accumulated selling foreign
exchange to the central bank, the China Securities Journal
reported today, citing unidentified people.  To contact the reporter on this story:
