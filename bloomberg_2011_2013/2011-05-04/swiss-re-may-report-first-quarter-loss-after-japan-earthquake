Swiss Reinsurance Co., the world’s
second-biggest reinsurer, may post a second consecutive
quarterly loss after claims from earthquakes in  New Zealand  and
 Japan .  The company will probably report a net loss of $1.04
billion after a year-earlier profit of $158 million, according
to the average estimate of nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.
The Zurich-based reinsurer is due to report earnings tomorrow at
7 a.m. local time.  Swiss Re, which is bidding to regain the AA credit rating
that  Standard & Poor’s  cut in 2009, expects major first-quarter
losses of about $2.3 billion after the temblors in Japan and New
Zealand. That may erode the company’s capital, which exceeded
S&P’s AA requirements by more than $10 billion at the end of
last year.  Spending on claims and costs as a percentage of premiums,
the so-called combined ratio, probably worsened to 158.6 percent
from 109.4 percent a year earlier, analysts said.  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures in millions of dollars.
