Oil halted a two-day slide in  London ,
recouping earlier losses after data showed that companies added
workers last month in the U.S., the world’s largest consumer of
crude.  Brent futures pared an earlier loss of 0.6 percent after a
report showed companies in the U.S. added employees in April,
signaling the labor market is strengthening. Crude stockpiles
probably increased from the highest since November, according to
a Bloomberg News survey before an Energy Department report today
Yesterday, the American Petroleum Institute said crude
inventories climbed for a fifth week.  “Oil stocks have been tightening, but are not tight just
yet” in developed economies, said  Harry Tchilinguirian , head
of commodity-markets strategy at BNP Paribas SA in London.  Brent crude  for June settlement on the ICE Futures Europe
exchange in London was at $122.32 a barrel at 1:36 p.m. after
falling as much as 73 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $121.72 a
barrel. Yesterday, the contract lost $2.67, or 2.1 percent, to
$122.45, the biggest one-day decline since April 12.  Crude for June delivery on the New York Mercantile fell as
much as 90 cents to $110.15 a barrel and was at $110.67 at 1:23
p.m. London time. Yesterday, it decreased $2.47, or 2.2 percent,
to $111.05, the biggest drop since April 18. Prices have
advanced 34 percent in the past year.  Employment at U.S. companies increased by 179,000 in April,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The median
estimate in the Bloomberg News survey called for a 198,000
advance this month.  U.S. crude inventories rose 2 million barrels in the week
to April 29 from 363.1 million, according to the median estimate
from 15 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg News. Gasoline stockpiles
are expected to have slipped 500,000 barrels from 205.6 million,
which would be an 11th weekly decline.  Yesterday, the industry-funded  American Petroleum Institute 
said crude stockpiles rose 3.2 million barrels and gasoline
supplies climbed 680,000 barrels.  The Energy Department will release its Weekly Petroleum
Status Report at 10:30 a.m. in  Washington .  To contact the reporter on this story:
