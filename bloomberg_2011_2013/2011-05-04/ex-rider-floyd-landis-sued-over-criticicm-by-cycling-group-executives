The International Cycling Union and
its current and former presidents sued  Floyd Landis , stripped of
the 2006 Tour de France title, over comments the athlete made
about the sport’s governing body.  The group, President Pat McQuaid and ex-head Hein
Verbruggen took the action in Swiss courts because of
“repeated, serious attacks against their characters,” the
organization, known by its French acronym, UCI, said today in an
e-mailed statement.  “The UCI is seeking to defend the integrity of the cycling
movement as a whole against the accusations of a rider who, by
breaking the anti-doping rules, caused cycling serious harm,”
the UCI said.  Landis was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title for
doping. Last May, Landis sent e-mails to cycling officials
accusing  Lance Armstrong  and other former teammates on the U.S.
Postal Service team of doping. Armstrong has denied the
allegations, saying Landis has “zero” credibility.  Landis spent more than $1 million on legal fees fighting
his Tour de France disqualification, about half of which was
paid through donations. He also served a two-year ban.  In 2010, he admitted in the e-mails to cycling officials
that he was doping for several years of his career.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
