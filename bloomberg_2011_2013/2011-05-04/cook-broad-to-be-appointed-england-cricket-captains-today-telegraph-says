Alastair Cook will be named captain of
the  England  one-day cricket team today, while Stuart Broad will
take over as skipper of the Twenty20 squad, the Daily Telegraph
reported.  Cook will replace  Andrew Strauss , who wants to concentrate
on the Test captaincy, the Telegraph reported without saying
where it got the information. Broad will take over from Paul Collingwood, whose form has dropped since he led England to the
World Twenty20 title last year, the newspaper said.  The appointments, which leave England in the unique
position of having a different permanent captain in each of the
three formats, will be announced at a news conference with team
director Andy Flower and Hugh Morris, managing director of the
England squad, the Telegraph said. Flower renewed his contract
with the England and Wales Cricket Board two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
