The lowest U.S. corporate bond yields
in five months are helping  Westfield Group (WDC)  and  Woodside
Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  lower borrowing costs as Australian companies
sell record amounts of notes in the world’s biggest  debt market .  Westfield, the Sydney-based shopping mall owner, sold $1
billion of 4.625 percent, 10-year bonds to yield 147 basis
points more than Treasuries on May 3, less than half the premium
paid on its previous offering in the currency, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Oil producer Woodside issued $700 million
of 2021 debt at a 135 basis-point spread, compared with a gap of
230 on five-year bonds it sold in 2009.  Australian borrowers have sold $35.6 billion of notes in
the U.S. since Jan. 1, the biggest start to a year on record.
They’re funding expansion back home, where the central bank
estimates the economy will grow 4.25 percent in 2011. New
investment by companies will surge 30 percent to A$132.7 billion
($142.3 billion) in the 12 months through June 2012, according
to the statistics bureau, as Chinese and Indian demand for raw
materials spurs the nation’s biggest resources boom in a
century.  “Some corporates see this as an opportune time to issue,”
said  Michael Bush , Melbourne-based head of credit research at
 National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB)  “U.S. investors look favorably on
Australian paper at the moment because of the strength of the
domestic economy and indirect exposure to  China .”  Yields on U.S. dollar corporate notes have fallen to
average 3.85 percent, the lowest since Nov. 29 and compared with
6.7 percent in  Australia , Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes
show.  ‘Robust’ Debt Market  In November 2009 Woodside, the nation’s second-largest oil
and gas producer, priced $700 million of 2014 bonds at a 230
basis-point spread, Bloomberg data show. Chief Financial Officer
Lawrie Tremaine said in February the Perth-based company may
sell notes in 2011 to take advantage of a “robust” debt market
even though it had enough funding to meet commitments for the
year.  Westfield, rated A- by  Standard & Poor’s , paid a 350 basis-
point spread when it sold $1.25 billion of 6.75 percent 10-year
bonds in August 2009, Bloomberg data show. Those notes last
traded at a relative yield of 157 basis points, according to BNP
Paribas SA prices.  The mall owner will use proceeds from the latest sale to
reduce outstanding revolving bank loans, while Woodside, rated
BBB+ by S&P, will repay debt maturing this year and fund its
capital and exploration program, the companies said in separate
stock exchange filings yesterday. Julia Clarke, a Westfield
spokeswoman and Laura Hammer, a Woodside spokeswoman, declined
to comment beyond the statements.  Commodities Boom  Australia expects to earn a record A$220.6 billion from
exports of commodities in the 12 months ending June 30 as faster
economic growth in China boosts demand for raw materials.  The boost from commodities helped the Australian dollar
strengthen to a record $1.1012 on May 2. The currency climbed 18
percent in the past 12 months to trade at $1.0719 as of 5:11
p.m. in Sydney today.  The  Reserve Bank  of Australia raised  interest rates  seven
times between October 2009 and November 2010 to 4.75 percent to
curb inflation as a mining-investment boom drove unemployment
below 5 percent. The  Federal Reserve  has kept its target rate
for overnight loans between banks in a record low range of zero
to 0.25 percent since December 2008.  The gap between yields on Australian  government bonds  and
inflation-indexed notes show investors expect consumer prices
will rise an annual 3.06 percent for the next five years, the
fastest among eight developed nations tracked by Bloomberg.  Average Yields  Australian five-year government bond yields fell 5 basis
point to 5.19 percent this quarter. Yields on similar-maturity
Treasuries have declined 34 basis points to 1.93 percent in the
same period.  The average yield on U.S. company bonds has fallen 25 basis
points this year. Yields on Australian corporate debt dropped 48
basis points, Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes show. At 286
basis points, the gap between the two rates is the widest since
Jan. 28.  The extra yield investors demand to own  U.S. dollar 
corporate bonds instead of Treasuries has shrunk 19 basis points
this year to 147 basis points, according to the New York-based
bank’s U.S. Corporate Master Index. Spreads narrowed to 145 on
April 11, the least since October 2007.  Telstra Corp., National Australia Bank and Woolworths Ltd.
are among Australian issuers that have sold bonds in the
currency this year, Bloomberg data show. The nation’s firms need
to refinance as much as A$80 billion of maturing borrowings in
2011, according to National Australia Bank.  “I’d expect more issuance while yields remain low and
investor demand stays strong,” said Chris Viol, a credit
analyst at UBS AG in Sydney. “With Treasury yields and credit
spreads contracting, it makes a ton of sense for issuers.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
