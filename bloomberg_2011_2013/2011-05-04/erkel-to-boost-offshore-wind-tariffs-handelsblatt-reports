German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  plans
to raise tariffs for wind and geothermal power, spurring
investment in renewable energy as the country mulls a quicker
exit from nuclear power, according to the  Handelsblatt .  Merkel’s government is overhauling  Germany ’s renewable
energy legislation this year and may raise charges for power
from new offshore wind parks to 15 cents from 13 cents per
kilowatt-hour from January 2012, the newspaper said, citing
government documents.  Lower rates for the tariffs may only kick-in from 2018
instead of 2015 today, the newspaper said. The so-called “feed-
in tariffs” are costs borne by power grid owners or operators
in buying renewable energy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
