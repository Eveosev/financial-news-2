Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , the largest independent
refiner on the U.S. West Coast, reported its fourth consecutive
quarterly profit as the average margin between oil costs and
fuel prices more than doubled.  First-quarter net income was $107 million, or 74 cents a
share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $155 million, or
$1.11, San Antonio-based Tesoro said in a statement today.
Excluding a loss related to asset disposals and impairments,
profit in the quarter was about 75 cents a share, 10 cents
higher than the average of 16 analysts’ estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  “It’s a solid quarter,” said Stacey Hudson, an analyst
with Raymond James & Associates Inc. in Houston who rates the
shares “underperform” and owns none. “It’s always nice to see
them beat the street.”  Rising onshore production of U.S. and Canadian oil has led
to a glut at the Cushing, Oklahoma, trading and storage hub,
causing oil there to trade at lower prices than crude elsewhere.
Companies with plants nearby, such as Tesoro, which has
refineries in  North Dakota  and  Salt Lake City , benefit from
access to cheaper crude. Gross refining margins per barrel from
the two plants were $20.77, more than double the amount last
year.  The crack spread, a measure of the difference between the
cost of crude and the price at which refiners can sell the
processed fuel, averaged $20.312 during the first quarter, more
than double the average for the same period a year ago,
according to Bloomberg data.  Sales Rise  Tesoro’s sales in the first quarter rose 42 percent to
$6.53 billion from $4.61 billion a year earlier. The company
processed 561,000 barrels of crude a day in the quarter, an 11
percent increase from 505,000 in the first three months of 2010.  Tesoro operates seven North American refineries that can
process about 694,000 barrels of oil daily, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The earnings statement was released after the end of
regular trading on U.S. markets. Tesoro was unchanged at $24.89
as of 6:30 p.m. in after-hours trading. The shares, which have
gained 34 percent this year, have seven buy ratings from
analysts, nine holds and two sells.  To contact the reporter on this story:
