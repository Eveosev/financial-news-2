OAO EuroChem,  Russia ’s largest maker
of nitrogen fertilizer, hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to advise
the company on a possible acquisition of 80 percent of  OAO
Minudobreniya  that will value the rival at $1.3 billion.  Rossosh, as Minudobreniya is also known, is part-owned by
 Yara International ASA (YAR) , EuroChem said in a statement today.  Lawmaker Nikolai Olshansky and businessman Alex Rovt, who
jointly control Rossosh, have been trying to sell it for more
than $1 billion to Ukraine billionaire Dmitry Firtash, co-owner
of natural-gas trader Rosukrenergo, Vedomosti said yesterday.  Rossosh officials weren’t immediately available for comment
when Bloomberg News called the company’s offices today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
