Poland ’s telecommunications watchdog
will rule in coming days on refunding 800 million zloty ($300
million) in costs that  Telekomunikacja Polska SA (TPS)  spent on the
so-called common services,  Parkiet  reported, without citing
anyone.  The country’s largest phone company filed for reimbursement
and plans to ask for additional 160 million zloty, Chief
Executive Officer Maciej Witucki told the newspaper. The common
services include maintenance of available phone lines, telephone
directories as well as phone booths; all operators with revenue
above 4 billion zloty should participate in these costs,
according to the law.  The  watchdog  will publish its decision no earlier than May
6, Parkiet added.  To contact the reporter on this story:
