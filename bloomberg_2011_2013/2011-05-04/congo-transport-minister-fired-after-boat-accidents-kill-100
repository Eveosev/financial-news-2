Democratic Republic of Congo’s
transportation minister was dismissed yesterday after two boat
accidents claimed the lives of more than 100 people in one week,
a government spokesman said.  Laure Marie Kawanda Kayene was “negligent” for not
enforcing regulations on Congo’s rivers, Minister of
Communications Lambert Mende said by phone today from Kinshasa,
the capital. Boat captains illegally transport civilians at
night, fail to carry life-saving equipment and are filling their
boats beyond capacity, he said.  “They’re not respecting any regulations,” Mende said.
“Their lists of passengers are fraudulent and they can’t even
determine how many people are on board.”  More than one hundred people are missing after a boat
capsized on the Kasai River on May 2, a week after a boat
carrying as many as 118 people capsized on Lake Kivu in eastern
Congo. Congo declared three days of mourning after the Kasai
River accident, Mende said.  The government has not yet named a replacement for Kayene,
Mende said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
