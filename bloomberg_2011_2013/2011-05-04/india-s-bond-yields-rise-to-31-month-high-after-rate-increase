India ’s government bonds fell, pushing
yields to the highest level in 31 months, after the central bank
boosted its benchmark lending rate by more than most economists
predicted.  The  Reserve Bank of India  lifted the repurchase rate by 0.5
percentage point to 7.25 percent yesterday, the ninth increase
since the beginning of last year. Seven of 25 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg expected the move, with 18 forecasting
0.25 percentage point.  Oil companies  may increase fuel prices
this month, which would create more inflationary pressure, said
A.Y. Shedshale, a Mumbai-based deputy general manager in charge
of fixed-income at  Bank of Maharashtra. (BOMH)   “Investors are probably pricing in a hike in fuel
prices,” he said. “The aggressive rate increase has damped
demand for debt.”  The yield on the 7.80 percent note due April 2021 rose six
basis points to 8.29 percent at the 5 p.m. close in Mumbai,
according to the central bank’s trading system. The rate is the
highest for a 10-year security since October 2008. A basis point
is 0.01 percentage point.  Inflation may stay around 9 percent until September because
of higher fuel prices, the central bank said in a statement
yesterday. India’s benchmark wholesale price index rose 8.98
percent in March from a year earlier, exceeding the  Reserve Bank 
of India’s 8 percent estimate.  The  Reserve Bank of India’s  interest-rate increases will
start slowing prices from October, Deputy Governor Subir Gokarn
said in a conference call with analysts today.  India sold 110 billion rupees of treasury bills as planned
at a weekly auction, the central bank said. The government sold
80 billion rupees of 91-day bills at a maximum yield of 7.8936
percent, the highest level since October 2008. It also auctioned
30 billion rupees of 364-day bills at a maximum yield of 8.2007
percent.  The cost of one-year interest-rate, or derivative contracts
used to guard against fluctuations in borrowing costs, gained
five basis points to 8.15 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
