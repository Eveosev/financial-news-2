Nvidia Corp. (NVDA)  put options expiring this
week were today’s most-active contracts on the stock as
investors boosted wagers that the maker of three-dimensional
graphics processors will retreat in the next two days.  The May $18 puts were traded 13,338 times as of 4 p.m. New
York time, accounting for 43 percent of total volume in Nvidia
contracts giving the right to sell the stock. The shares slipped
0.8 percent to $18.65 and dropped to $18.30 earlier, the lowest
intraday level since April 20.  “Today’s activity is being dominated by opening buyers,”
or investors purchasing puts in a bet Nvidia will fall, wrote
 Patrick Mortimer , director of options trading at Pipeline
Trading Systems LLC in  New Hope , Pennsylvania. Investors
probably want either short-term protection for Nvidia shares
they already own after they dropped 4.8 percent yesterday or
they believe the current three-day losing streak will continue
through the end of the week, he said.  Nvidia, based in  Santa Clara , California, rallied 22
percent this year through yesterday, almost quadruple the gain
for technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The
company is scheduled to report quarterly results on May 12,
after this week’s options expire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
