Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
 Switzerland ’s biggest insurer, may say first-quarter profit fell
on claims from floods in  Australia  and the earthquake in Japan.  Net income probably dropped to $765.6 million from $935
million a year earlier, according to the average estimate of
nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The Zurich-based insurer is
due to release results tomorrow at 6:45 a.m. local time.  The company estimated on March 31 it would have total
claims of about $500 million from the five natural disasters
that hit the Asia-Pacific region in the first quarter, including
the Brisbane floods, the Victoria storms and cyclone Yasi in
Australia, the Christchurch earthquake in  New Zealand  and the
earthquake and tsunami in  Japan .  The insurer’s combined ratio, or spending on claims and
costs as a percentage of premiums, probably worsened to 103
percent from 99 percent a year earlier, according to the average
estimate of nine analysts.  Aon Benfield, an arm of the world’s largest insurance
broker, expects total losses for insurers and reinsurers to top
$52.6 billion in the first quarter, compared with $40.6 billion
for the whole of 2010.  The following is a table of the analysts’ estimates and
year-earlier figures. The numbers, except for the combined
ratio, are in millions of dollars.
