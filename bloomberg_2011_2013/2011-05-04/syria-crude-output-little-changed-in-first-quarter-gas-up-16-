Syria , trying to stop a decline in its
oil output, pumped 1.2 percent more crude in the first quarter
than in the comparable period last year, the Oil Ministry said.  The country boosted its production of natural gas by 16
percent over the same 12 months, the ministry said today.  Crude output reached an average 387,000 barrels a day in
the first quarter, up from 382,300 barrels a day last year.
Syria pumped a total of 34.8 million barrels of oil from January
through March, with state-run companies accounting for 18.3
million barrels of the total and eight joint ventures the rest,
the ministry said in an e-mailed statement.  The country exported 12.1 million barrels of crude in the
first quarter, according to the ministry.  Syria is seeking foreign investment to help stabilize
output this year at a rate of 386,000 barrels a day, Oil
Minister Sufian Alao said on March 13. Crude production peaked
at 583,000 barrels a day in 1996, and the country will deplete
existing reserves within 18 years, according to its reserves-to-
production ratio as calculated by BP Plc.  Syriaâ€™s oil reserves rank ninth in size in the Middle East,
according to BP data. The Arab nation called on companies to
submit bids for production-sharing rights in three offshore
energy concessions by Oct. 5.  Quarterly gas production rose to 2.66 billion cubic meters,
or 29.6 million cubic meters a day, the ministry said. Gas
output stood at 2.29 billion cubic meters in the same period of
2010, it said. Syria imported about 121 million cubic meters of
the fuel from  Egypt  in the most recent quarter, according to the
statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
