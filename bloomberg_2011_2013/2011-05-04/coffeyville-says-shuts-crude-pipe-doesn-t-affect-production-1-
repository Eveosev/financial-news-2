CVR Energy Inc. (CVI)  shut a crude-oil
pipeline in Kansas near its Coffeyville refinery after a leak
and said refinery operations aren’t affected.  “It’s a relatively small leak being picked up now,” Steve
Eames, a spokesman for the plant, said in an e-mail. “We will
inspect the line and decide how long it will need to be out for
repairs. No impact on refinery production.”  The 2,500-barrel-a-day pipeline originates near
Bartlesville,  Oklahoma , and runs to the company’s Broome station
in southern Kansas, said Eames. He said the company will use
other forms of transportation until the line is fixed.  Between 15 and 30 barrels spilled from the 8-inch pipe
because of internal corrosion, according to a report filed with
the National Response Center.  The Coffeyville refinery has a capacity of 120,000 barrels
a day, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
