Kenya Power & Lighting Co., the East
African country’s sole electricity distributor, increased
electricity prices to reflect foreign-exchange rate fluctuations
and rising fuel costs.  Costs will rise by 126 cents per kilowatt hour because of
changes in the value of the shilling, and 615 cents per kilowatt
hour for fuel charges, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement published in the Government Gazette. It didn’t provide
comparative figures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
