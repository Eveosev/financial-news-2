Perusahaan Otomobil Kedua Sdn., a
Malaysian carmaker, may accelerate plans for a 250 million
ringgit ($84 million) parts factory after the March 11  Japan 
earthquake disrupted supplies.  The manufacturer, which also assembles vehicles for  Toyota
Motor Corp. (7203) , is in talks with shareholder Daihatsu Motor Co. and
other potential investors about beginning production in late
2012, Managing Director Aminar Rashid Salleh told reporters in
 Kuala Lumpur  today. Construction of the factory, which will make
electronic automatic transmissions, may start near the end of
this year, he said. Thatâ€™s earlier than planned.  The factory will initially serve the domestic market,
before beginning exports a few years later, possibly including
to Japan, Aminar said. The closely held company wants to pare
its reliance on Japanese parts after supply shortages caused by
the March temblor forced an 11 percent cut in production.  Perodua, as the Selangor-based company is known, expects to
return to full production by July, which is earlier than
expected, Aminar said. It plans to add a new own-brand compact
car by August.  The company, also part-owned by  UMW Holdings Bhd. (UMWH) , is
maintaining a sales target of 195,000 vehicles this year, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
