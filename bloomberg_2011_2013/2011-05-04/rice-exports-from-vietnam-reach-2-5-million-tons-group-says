Vietnam , the world’s second-largest
rice exporter, shipped 2.5 million metric tons from the start of
the year to April 28, the  Vietnam Food Association  said.  Shipments were 660,091 tons between April 1 and April 28,
the association said in a statement on its website today,
without giving a figure for the year-ago period.  Vietnam may ship as much as 7.4 million tons in 2011,
Vietnam’s  agricultural ministry  said on April 8.  --Nick Heath. Editors: Jake Lloyd-Smith, Thomas Abraham  To contact the reporter on this story:
