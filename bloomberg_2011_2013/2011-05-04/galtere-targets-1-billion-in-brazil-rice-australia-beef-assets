Galtere Ltd. hopes to raise $1 billion
for a private-equity fund created in September to invest in
agricultural assets, according to Renatto Barbieri, the
portfolio manager.  Half the fund will be invested in rice farms in  Brazil  and
in beef and cattle production in  Australia , Barbieri said. The
remaining money will be allocated to infrastructure, including
grain-storage facilities, he said.  “We are looking at rice farmlands as it is the main food
crop,” Barbieri said yesterday during an interview at an
agriculture conference in  New York . “Have you heard of anyone
dying because of not eating sugar or corn or soybeans?”  Galtere was founded in 1997 by Renee Haugerud, who spent 15
years at Cargill Inc., according to the company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
