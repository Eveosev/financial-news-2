Canada ’s dollar dropped against most
of its major counterparts as stocks and commodities fell,
damping demand for assets related to global economic growth.  The loonie, as the currency is also known for the image of
the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, slid for a third day against
the greenback in its longest losing streak since March. Crude
oil supplies in the U.S., Canada’s biggest trading partner, rose
last week to the highest level since October.  “There’s more of a risk-off approach to trading,”  Jack Spitz , managing director of foreign exchange at  National Bank of
Canada , said by phone from Toronto. “That’s likely to
contribute to some U.S. dollar bids. There’s no strong indicator
from equity markets that the risk barometer is going to be
turned on.”  The loonie depreciated 0.7 percent to 95.94 cents versus
the greenback at 5:16 p.m. in Toronto, from 95.26 yesterday,
after sliding to 96.04, the weakest level since April 19. One
Canadian dollar buys $1.0434. The currency touched 94.46 cents
on April 29, the strongest since November 2007.  Government bonds  rose, pushing the yield on the 10-year
note down four basis points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 3.11
percent. The 3.5 percent security due in June 2020 gained 32
cents to C$103.06.  Canada auctioned today C$2.5 billion ($2.6 billion) of 10-
year debt, drawing an average yield of 3.211 percent. The
government received bids of C$6.1 billion for the 3.25 percent
securities maturing in June 2021, according to a statement on
the Bank of Canada’s website.  Unemployment Reports  Declines in the loonie may be limited before Canadian and
U.S. employment reports May 6, according to Matt Perrier,
director of foreign-exchange sales at Bank of Montreal’s BMO
Capital Markets unit.  “We could see a little further weakness on the Canadian
dollar in the near term, but I don’t think the market will get
too carried away until we see the employment numbers,” Perrier
said by phone from Toronto.  Employers in Canada added 20,000 positions in April after a
decrease of 1,500 in the previous month, according to the median
forecast of 25 economists in a Bloomberg News survey before the
report this week from  Statistics Canada . America gained 185,000
jobs, according to the median forecast before the U.S. Labor
Department’s payrolls report.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 0.7 percent. The
MSCI World Index, a measure of stocks in developed nations,
declined 0.8 percent. Futures on crude oil, Canada’s biggest
export, tumbled 2 percent to $108.81 a barrel in  New York .  U.S. crude oil stockpiles rose last week by 3.42 million
barrels to 366.5 million, the highest level since October, the
Energy Department reported.  The Canadian dollar slid 1.1 percent to 84.04 yen, declined
0.7 percent to C$1.4215 versus the euro and depreciated 0.7
percent to C$1.5813 against the pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
