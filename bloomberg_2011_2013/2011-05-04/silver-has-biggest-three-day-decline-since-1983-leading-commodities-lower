Silver had its biggest three-day drop
since March 1983, crude oil tumbled to a two-week low and gold,
copper and grains fell after money managers made near-record
bets on high commodity prices in April.  Silver plummeted 19 percent since April 29 as increases in
Comex margin requirements drove investors away, and oil declined
after a U.S. report showed supplies surged. A drop in a gauge of
U.S.  service industries  and lower-than-forecast jobs growth
damped economic optimism. Twenty-two of 24 commodities in the
Standard & Poor’s GSCI Total Return Index fell. Treasuries rose.  Commodities from oil to corn to gold surged for an eighth
month in April, with the S&P GSCI index beating bonds, stocks
and the dollar every month since December, the longest stretch
in at least 14 years. Prices that no longer reflect fundamentals
are likely to retreat in the next three to six months before
rebounding, Goldman Sachs said in reports April 11 and April 15.  “The big correction in silver kind of led the way, and
that got people looking at commodities as a whole,” said
 Richard Ilczyszyn , a market strategist at Lind-Waldock, a broker
in Chicago. “There seems to be a little reduction in risk
globally. We’ve seen the equity market pull back, crude pull
back, silver and gold. We saw a flood into Treasuries. That
tells me people are looking for safety right now.”  Silver futures for July delivery slumped $3.197, or 7.5
percent, to settle at $39.388 an ounce on the Comex in New York.
Yesterday’s decline was 7.6 percent, while a day earlier it was
5.2 percent.  Margin Requirements  CME Group Ltd., Comex’s owner, this week raised the minimum
amount of cash that must be deposited when borrowing from
brokers to trade silver futures to $16,200 per contract from
$14,513, effective at the close of business yesterday, the
second increase in less than a week. A year ago, the margin was
$4,250. Silver futures rallied 57 percent this year through
April.  The price touched $49.845 on April 25. Silver reached a
record $50.35 in January 1980 as the Hunt brothers tried to
corner the market.  The S&P GSCI index fell 1.5 percent to 731.86 at 3:02 p.m.
in  New York . It reached a 32-month high of 762.22 on April 11.  Oil fell 1.6 percent after the U.S. Energy Department
reported stockpiles rose 3.42 million barrels to 366.5 million
last week, the highest level since October. Inventories were
forecast to gain 2 million barrels, a Bloomberg News survey
showed. Lower-than-forecast growth in service industries and
employment reduced optimism about the economic outlook.  Bearish Numbers  “The inventory numbers were much more bearish than
expected,” said Andre Julian, chief financial officer and
senior market strategist at OpVest Wealth Management in  Irvine ,
 California . “We were already poised for a move lower when the
inventory data and the negative economic numbers came out. This
is looking like a perfect time to take risk off the table.”  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.81 to $109.24 a barrel
on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest settlement since
April 19. Prices are up 32 percent from a year ago. Gasoline for
June delivery slipped 0.2 percent to $3.3225 a gallon. Natural
gas for June delivery fell 9.3 cents to settle at $4.577 per
million British thermal units on the Nymex.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing companies declined to 52.8 last month, lower than
the median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News,
from 57.3 in March. Readings greater than 50 signal growth.
Another report showed the pace of hiring cooled in April.  Equities, Treasuries  Stocks fell and Treasuries rose on concern that a slowdown
in economic growth that began in the first three months of the
year is extending into the second quarter. The report validates
the  Federal Reserve ’s decision last week to maintain record
monetary stimulus to bolster the world’s largest economy.  Estimates in the Bloomberg survey of 73 economists ranged
from 54.5 to 59. The Tempe, Arizona-based group’s index of the
industry, which accounts for about 90 percent of the economy,
averaged 56.1 in the five years to December 2007, when the last
recession began.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.7 percent to
1,347.31 at 3:05 p.m. in New York. The yield on the benchmark
10-year Treasury note declined today to 3.2 percent, the lowest
level since March 17.  Employment at U.S. companies increased by 179,000 in April,
the smallest gain in five months, according to figures today
from ADP Employer Services. The median estimate in a Bloomberg
survey called for a 198,000 gain.  “The investment funds are dumping commodity positions
because of the uncertainty about world growth,” said  Shawn McCambridge , the senior grain analyst for Prudential Bache
Commodities LLC in  Chicago . “People are worried that the global
consumer is scaling back spending.”  Wheat, Soybeans  Wheat futures for July delivery fell 21.25 cents, or 2.7
percent, to $7.72 a bushel at 1:15 p.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade, the lowest settlement since March 30. Before today, the
most-active contract gained 58 percent in the past year as
adverse weather reduced global production.  Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 11.75 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $13.52 a bushel, the lowest close since April
15. The price dropped 2.2 percent in the previous two days.
Before today, the oilseed, used to make livestock feed and
cooking oil, gained 38 percent in the past year.  The U.S. is the world’s leading exporter of corn, soybeans
and wheat.  The Thomson Reuters/Jefferies CRB Index of 19 raw materials
headed for the biggest drop in three weeks. Only corn, cattle
and hogs posted gains today.  Corn Gains  Corn futures for July delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close $7.295 a bushel in Chicago, erasing an earlier
drop to $7.1625, the lowest since March 31.  Corn is the biggest U.S. crop, valued at $66.7 billion in
2010, followed by soybeans at $38.9 billion, government figures
show. Wheat is the fourth-largest, behind hay, at $13 billion.  Gold futures for June delivery fell $25.10, or 1.6
percent, to $1,515.30 an ounce. On May 2, the metal rose to a
record $1,577.40. Before today, the price gained 30 percent in
the past year.  Gold declined after a report that Soros Fund Management
LLC, the $28 billion hedge fund run by Keith Anderson, has sold
much of its gold and silver holdings. The report in the Wall
Street Journal today, cited unidentified people. Many of the
sales took place over the past month as there was a reduced risk
of deflation, according to the report.  Copper for July delivery lost 11.9 cents, or 2.8 percent,
to $4.1340 a pound on the Comex in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
