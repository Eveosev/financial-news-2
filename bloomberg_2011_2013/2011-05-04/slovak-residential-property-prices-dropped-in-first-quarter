Slovak residential property prices
declined 0.5 percent in the first quarter as elevated
unemployment hurts demand, the central bank said.  The average price for residential property dropped to 1,264
euros ($1,879) per square meter (10.8 square feet) from 1,270
euros in the fourth quarter, the Bratislava, Slovakia-based
Narodna Banka Slovenska  said  today on its website. On an annual
basis, prices were down 2.5 percent.  The residential-property market in the eastern eurozone
member is struggling to recover after the 2009 recession as the
 unemployment rate , at 13.1 percent in March, remains close to a
six-year high. The average price is 18 percent down from the
peak reached in the second quarter of 2008.  Prices varied from 602 euros a square meter in the Nitra
region of western Slovakia, to 1,694 euros in the capital,
Bratislava.  To contact the reporter on this story:
