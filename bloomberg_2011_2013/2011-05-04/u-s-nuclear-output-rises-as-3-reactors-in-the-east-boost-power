U.S. nuclear-power production rose for
the second day as reactors in  Connecticut ,  New Jersey  and
Georgia boosted output, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission said.  Power generation nationwide increased 1,441 megawatts, or
2.1 percent, from yesterday to 70,385 megawatts, or 69 percent
of capacity, according to an NRC report today and data compiled
by Bloomberg. Thirty of the nationâ€™s 104 reactors were offline.  Dominion Resources Inc. increased output at 884-megawatt
Millstone 2 to 66 percent of capacity from 18 percent yesterday.
Another reactor at the site, the 1,227-megawatt Millstone 3, is
at full power. The plant is located about 3 miles (5 kilometers)
southwest of New London, Connecticut.  Public Service Enterprise Group Inc. (PEG)  boosted the 1,174-
megawatt Salem 1 unit in New Jersey to 88 percent of capacity
from 18 percent yesterday. The reactor was shut April 21 after
water intake filters became clogged, and has fluctuated in
output since returning to service a few days later. Another unit
at the site, 1,130-megawatt Salem 2, is closed. The plant is
about 18 miles south of Wilmington,  Delaware .  Southern Co. (SO)  boosted the 883-megawatt Edwin I. Hatch 2
reactor in Georgia to 52 percent of capacity from 23 percent
yesterday. The 876-megawatt Hatch 1 is operating at full power.
The plant is about 74 miles west of Savannah.  Dominion slowed the 556-megawatt Kewaunee reactor in
Wisconsin to 91 percent of capacity from full power yesterday.
The reactor is located about 27 miles southeast of Green Bay.  Some reactors are closed for maintenance and refueling
during the spring and fall in the U.S., when demand for heating
and cooling is lower. The outages can increase consumption of
natural gas and coal to generate electricity.  The average U.S. reactor  refueling outage  lasted 41 days in
2009, according to the  Nuclear Energy Institute .  To contact the reporter on this story:
