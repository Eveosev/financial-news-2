Crude shipments from Dansk Undergrunds
Consortium, the producer part-owned by A.P. Moeller Maersk A/S,
are scheduled to stay unchanged at seven cargoes next month,
according to a loading program.  A total of 4.2 million barrels, or 140,000 barrels a day,
of crude oil will be exported in June, compared with 135,484
barrels a day this month, the plan showed.  Copenhagen-based Maersk holds 39 percent of the venture,
known as DUC.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  owns 46 percent and  Chevron
Corp. (CVX)  has 15 percent. Maersk will receive four cargoes, while
Shell will get two and Chevron one, according to the schedule.  To contact the reporter on this story:
