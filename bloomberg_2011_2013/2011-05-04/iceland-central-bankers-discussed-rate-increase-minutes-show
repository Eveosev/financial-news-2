Members of the Icelandic central
bank’s policy board discussed increasing the benchmark interest
rate by 25 basis points, according to minutes of the bank’s
April 18 and April 19 rate meetings, published today.  “Three alternative rate decisions were discussed: to keep
rates unchanged or to raise them or lower by 0.25 percentage
points,” the minutes showed. “The governor proposed that the
bank’s interest rates be kept unchanged” and four out of five
members supported the proposal. “One member voted against the
governor’s proposal, preferring to raise interest rates by 0.25
percentage points.”  The central bank kept the benchmark seven-day collateral
lending rate at 4.25 percent on April 20. Iceland ended a cycle
of 15 interest rate cuts in March, after the north Atlantic
island received a $4.6 billion bailout from the  International
Monetary Fund  in 2008.  To contact the reporter on this story:
