Spanish clothes retailer Mango has
acquired a building on Ermou Street in downtown  Athens  for 13.5
million euros ($20 million), the Real Estate and Development
website reported, without saying where it got the information.  The acquisition is part of a trend among overseas clothing
retailers to increase market share in  Greece  as rents fall and
Greeks seek competitively-priced clothes, the news website said.  Mango is seeking to have 40 stores in Greece within the next
three years, RED said.  The purchase is the first major property transaction on
Ermou Street, Greeceâ€™s main shopping street, for almost 30
years, RED said. The property was initially listed in the real
estate market in 2009 for 22 million euros, the news website
said.  Click here for web link  To contact the reporter on this story:
