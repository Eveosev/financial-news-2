Relatives of two Houston residents who
died when an  Air France-KLM (AF)  plane plunged into the Atlantic
Ocean in 2009 have resolved their lawsuit against the air
carrier, a lawyer for the family members said.  “The family of Mike and Anne Harris have resolved their
lawsuit against Air France and all other parties,” Richard
Mithoff, who represented the relatives in a lawsuit in federal
court in Houston, said today in an e-mailed statement. “The
terms of that agreement are confidential.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
