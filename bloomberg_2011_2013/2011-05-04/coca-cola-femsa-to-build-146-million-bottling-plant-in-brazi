Coca-Cola Femsa SAB, Latin America’s
largest Coke bottler, said it will build a $146 million bottling
plant in  Brazil  to meet surging soft-drink demand.  The plant will be located in the state of  Minas Gerais  and
have annual production capacity of 2.1 billion liters by 2015,
the Mexico City-based company said in an e-mailed statement.  The company’s soft-drink, water and flavored-water volume
increased 12 percent in Brazil last year as the economy rose 7.5
percent, the fastest pace since 1985.  Hector Trevino, the company’s chief financial officer, said
on an April 27 conference call that a plan to build one plant in
Brazil and another in Colombia was presented to the board of
directors for approval. Trevino said  capital expenditures  will
likely increase by as much as $60 million from its original plan
to about $620 million this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
