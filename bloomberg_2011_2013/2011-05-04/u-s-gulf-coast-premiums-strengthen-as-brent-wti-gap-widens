U.S. Gulf oil grades strengthened as
the spread between the U.S. benchmark West Texas Intermediate
and Brent widened for the first time in five days.  The gap between WTI and its European counterpart for June
delivery increased 48 cents to $11.88 a barrel at 3:17 p.m. in
 New York . The differential for the contract nearest to
expiration reached a record $15.94 on Feb. 16.  When Brent gains versus WTI, it strengthens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European grade.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet’s premium to WTI widened 90 cents to
$14 a barrel at 13:04 p.m. in New York, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium gained 50
cents to $14.50 over the benchmark.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend widened 50 cents to $6.25 a barrel over WTI. Poseidon’s
premium strengthened 65 cents to $6.40.  Thunder Horse’s premium gained 45 cents to $10.20 a barrel
over WTI. Southern Green Canyon’s premium strengthened 60 cents
to $4.25 a barrel.  West  Texas  Sour’s discount narrowed 15 cents to $2.70 a
barrel. It has tracked more closely to its historical average
discount versus WTI because it’s delivered in Midland, Texas,
away from the  Gulf Coast  and close to Cushing,  Oklahoma , the
delivery point for oil traded on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange .  The premium for Syncrude gained 75 cents at $11 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in Alberta.  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 30 cents to
$16.30 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
