Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year note
yields to a six-week low, as private reports showed  service
industries  in the U.S. expanded less than forecast in April and
companies added fewer jobs last month than projected.  Six-month bill rates reached a record low for a third
consecutive day with the U.S. reducing sales of short-term
securities as lawmakers negotiate an increase in the $14.3
trillion federal debt ceiling. The Treasury said it will auction
$72 billion in 3-, 10- and 30-year debt next week even with the
U.S. likely to exceed its borrowing capacity before or after
Aug. 2.  Federal Reserve  Bank of Boston President  Eric Rosengren 
said stimulus is necessary to spur the “anemic” economy.  “The  bond market  reacted positively to the disappointing
economic news,” said Gary Pollack, head of fixed-income trading
at a Deutsche Bank AG Private Wealth Management group in  New
York  that oversees $12 billion. “Investors are buying bonds,
even at these low levels, as they anticipate weaker growth.”  The yield on the 10-year note fell three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 3.22 percent at 5:19 p.m. in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data, after touching 3.2
percent, the least since March 17. The price of the 3.625
percent note maturing in February 2021 rose 1/4, or $2.50 per
$1,000 face amount, to 103 3/8.  Bill Rates  Six-month bill rates fell to a record 0.0610 percent. The
Treasury has cut the amount of Supplementary Financing Program
bills, or SFPs, it sells on behalf of the Fed by $195 billion to
help avoid exceeding the  U.S. debt  limit. Congress is facing a
vote as early as this month on raising the debt ceiling.  A $24 billion one-year bill auction yesterday priced at
0.20 percent, the lowest since 1990 when the government began
releasing the data. Three month-bill yields yesterday traded at
0.02 percent, the lowest since December 2008.  U.S. Treasury Secretary  Timothy Geithner  said May 2 the
U.S. will have three weeks more than previously seen before
hitting its borrowing limit, giving the White House and Congress
more time for a deal to raise the debt ceiling.  Geithner said the Treasury on May 6 will stop issuing State
and Local Government Series securities, known as SLUGS, which
help issuers conform to tax rules that restrict the investment
of proceeds from the sale of tax-exempt debt.  Borrowing Limits  The U.S. can borrow until Aug. 2 after reaching the debt
limit because of “stronger-than-expected tax receipts” and by
taking “extraordinary measures” such as suspending the sale of
bonds to finance state and local infrastructure projects,
Geithner said in a letter to congressional leaders May 2. He
previously said the deadline would be July 8. Without such
measures, the legal limit will be reached May 16, he said.  The U.S. will sell $32 billion in three-year notes, $24
billion in 10-year debt and $16 billion in 30-year bonds on
three consecutive days beginning May 10, equaling the average
forecast in a Bloomberg News survey of 19 of 20 primary dealers
on May 2.  “The fact that it was unchanged was a bit of a surprise to
the market,” said  Ray Remy , head of fixed income in New York at
Daiwa Capital Markets America Inc, about the auction amount.
“Most people expected it to be reduced by $1 billion on all
three.”  U.S. debt has attracted $2.97 in bids for every dollar of
debt the Treasury has sold this year, near the record 2.99 bid-
to-cover ratio seen last year, as the relationship between bids
and offering size is known, Treasury data show. The U.S. has
sold $713 billion of notes and bonds so far this year, compared
with $812 billion at this time last year.  Policy ‘Appropriate’  Raising interest rates to combat increasing food and fuel
prices would impede growth, the Fed’s Rosengren said.  “With significant slack in labor markets, stable inflation
expectations, and  core inflation  well below our longer run
target, there is currently no reason to slow the economy down
with tighter monetary policy,” he said today in a speech in
 Boston . “Until we make more progress on both elements of the
Federal Reserve’s mandate -- employment and inflation -- the
current, accommodative stance of monetary policy is
appropriate.”  Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  signaled April 27 that the
central bank will maintain its record stimulus after it ends
large-scale bond purchases. The Fed has held its key rate at
zero to 0.25 percent since December 2008 and is aiming to
increase growth by completing $600 billion of Treasury purchases
through June.  Fed Purchase  The Fed purchased $1.49 billion of Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities due from July 2013 to February 2041 today.  The ISM’s index of non-manufacturing companies slumped to
52.8 in April, the lowest since August, from 57.3 a month
earlier. The median forecast of 73 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg News was 57.5.  “The changing outlook on the economy is helping
Treasuries to perform well,” said  Brian Edmonds , head of
 interest rates  at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one of 20
primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “People are a little
more somber. There’s a flight away from risk assets.”  Company employment increased 179,000 in April from a
revised gain of 207,000 in the prior month, according to figures
from ADP Employer Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg
News survey called for a 198,000 advance.  A Labor Department report on May 6 is forecast to show the
U.S. added 185,000 jobs, according to 84 economists in a
separate survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
