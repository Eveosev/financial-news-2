E.ON AG (EOAN)  plans to set up a test
facility to store wind power by producing methane with hydrogen
electrolysis,  Financial Times Deutschland  reported, citing
Klaus-Dieter Maubach, an E.ON management board member.  The utility is examining possible locations in northern
 Germany  for the pilot plant, which would have an initial
capacity of about 1 megawatt and start in 2012 or 2013, Maubach
said on Monday in the German city of Dusseldorf, according to
the newspaper.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
