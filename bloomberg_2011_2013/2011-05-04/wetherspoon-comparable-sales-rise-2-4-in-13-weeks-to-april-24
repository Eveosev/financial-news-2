JD Wetherspoon Plc (JDW) , a U.K. pub chain,
said comparable sales rose 2.4 percent in the 13 weeks to April
24, according to a statement today.  Total company sales over the same period rose by 7.4
percent, it said, with comparable sales in the year to date up
2.4 percent.  The company continues to be faced with rising costs for “a
wide range of goods and services, combined with a reduction in
disposable income for many of its customers,” it said.
Wetherspoon sees a “reasonable outcome” in the current
financial year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
