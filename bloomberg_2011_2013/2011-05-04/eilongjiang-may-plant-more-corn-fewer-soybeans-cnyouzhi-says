Farmers in  China ’s Heilongjiang
province, the country’s top soybean grower, may switch to
planting more corn this year as returns from selling the grain
improve, researcher Cnyouzhi.com said.  Areas planted with soybeans in the region may decline 20
percent from a year ago, the researcher said in a report, citing
Wang Xiaoyu, vice secretary-general of Heilongjiang Soybean
Association.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
