ESPN expanded its coverage of the
 World Series of Poker ’s main event this year following
indictments against gambling websites that spent almost $27
million on television ads in 2010.  The  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  network will increase its coverage of
the event with more than 34 additional hours of poker on ESPN,
ESPN2 and ESPN3.com, and for the first time air unedited action
on a 30-minute delay that shows the cards the players are
holding, known as the hole cards, the World Series of Poker said
in a news release.  From July 14 to 19, the networks will televise action as
the world’s richest tournament plays down to its final nine
competitors in  Las Vegas . ESPN will then air edited weekly shows
leading up to the final table on Nov. 8, as it did last year.  ESPN pre-empted “North American Poker Tour Presented by
PokerStars.net” on April 18, while News Corp.’s Fox Sports Net
pulled PokerStars.net ads from its “World Poker Tour”
coverage.  PokerStars.net  and  FullTiltPoker.net  were among companies
charged with fraud and money-laundering by the U.S. Attorney in
Manhattan on April 15. The two companies spent $26.8 million in
2010 on  TV advertising , according to researcher Kantar Media.  Caesars Entertainment Corp., the closely held casino
company, owns the  World Series  of Poker.  Last year’s main event was won by Canadian Jonathan Duhamel, who claimed the $8.9 million first prize after
surviving a field of 7,319 participants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
