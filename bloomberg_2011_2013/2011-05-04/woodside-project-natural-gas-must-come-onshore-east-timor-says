Natural gas from the Greater Sunrise
field to be developed by  Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL)  must be brought
into  East Timor  to stimulate the economy, Finance Minister
Emilia Pires said.  Bringing the gas onshore will “trigger multiple benefits
for other industries,” Pires said today, when asked about the
project at a meeting of the Asian Development Bank in the
Vietnamese capital of Hanoi.  Woodside and its partners including  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) 
have exclusive rights to develop the field. The proposed project
is “stalemated” because of disagreements between Woodside
Petroleum and the East Timor government over how to develop it,
Don Voelte, chief executive of the Australian energy producer,
said last month.  The Perth-based company has said a floating liquefied
natural gas plant in the  Timor Sea  is the best commercial option
and would deliver the most revenue to both Australia and East
Timor. Woodside has ruled out piping the gas to East Timor
because it estimates that would cost about $5 billion more.  --Jason Folkmanis in Hanoi. Editors: Ryan Woo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
