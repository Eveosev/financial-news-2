Linde AG (LIN) , the world’s second-biggest
maker of industrial gases, said first-quarter profit rose 43
percent on demand from Asia and the health-care industry.  Net income increased to 284 million euros ($420.6 million)
from 198 million euros a year earlier, the Munich-based company
said today in a statement. Sales rose 15 percent to 3.33 billion
euros. Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had estimated net income
of 250 million euros on sales of 3.25 billion euros.  Linde’s Asian and eastern Europe units generated the
fastest growth, mirroring results at larger competitor  Air
Liquide SA (AI) , which was boosted by sales in China, Singapore and
 South Korea . Both companies are sticking to forecasts of
increased earnings this year on demand from the electronics,
steel and health-care industries.  “We are well-positioned and will take full advantage of
the opportunities available, especially in the environmental and
energy sectors, the growth markets of  Asia  and the medical gases
business,” Chief Executive Officer Wolfgang Reitzle said in the
statement.  Linde has gained 7.7 percent this year in Frankfurt trading
for a market value of 20.8 billion euros. Shares of Paris-based
Air Liquide have risen 5.2 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
