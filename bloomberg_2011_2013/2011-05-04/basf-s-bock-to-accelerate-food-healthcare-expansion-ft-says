BASF SE (BAS) ’s incoming Chief Executive
Officer Kurt Bock intends to accelerate the company’s expansion
into the food and healthcare sectors as these are  “two things
that people will always be in need of,” the Financial Times
reported Bock as saying.  Bock, who takes over as CEO on May 6, said food and
healthcare are areas that “can grow” and “should grow” and
it would be “desirable if they would make up a higher
proportion of our future business,” the FT said, citing an
interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
