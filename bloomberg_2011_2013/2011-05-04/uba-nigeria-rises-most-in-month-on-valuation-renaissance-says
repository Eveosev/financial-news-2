United Bank for Africa Plc (UBA) , a Nigerian
lender, rose the most in more than a month as its current
valuation made it attractive to investors,  Renaissance Capital 
said.  The stock gained 29 kobo, or the maximum daily limit of 5
percent, to 6.14 naira by the 2:30 p.m. close in Lagos, the
biggest advance since April 1.  UBA, as the lender is known, is currently trading at a
price-to-book value of 0.98, according to Bloomberg data,
“which is cheaper than all the other tier-one banks,” Adesoji
Solanke, a Lagos-based banking analyst with Renaissance, said by
phone today. “It is not unusual to see investors who view it as
offering attractive valuations,” Solanke said.  Other so-called first-tier lenders are Zenith Bank Plc, the
country’s biggest by market value, which has a price-to-book
value of 1.38 and Guaranty Trust Bank Plc, the second-largest,
which trades at 2.36 times its book value, while First Bank of
Nigeria Plc, the third-biggest, is at 1.28.  UBA has fallen 16 percent this year, compared with a 2.6
percent gain in the Nigerian Stock Exchange All-Share Index over
the same period.  To contact the reporter on this story:
