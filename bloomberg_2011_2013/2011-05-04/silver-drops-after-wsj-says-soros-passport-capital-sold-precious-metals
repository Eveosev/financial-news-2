Silver futures fell, heading for the
biggest three-day drop since 2008, and gold also retreated amid
a report  Soros Fund Management  LLC sold precious-metal assets.  Soros Fund Management sold some holdings because of a
reduced risk of deflation, according to the Wall Street Journal,
which cited unidentified people close to the matter.  Michael Vachon , a spokesman for Soros, declined to comment. The fund
held shares in the SPDR Gold Trust, the biggest exchange-traded
product backed by gold, and the  iShares Gold Trust (IAU)  at the end of
2010, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings show.  Silver futures fell as much as 5 percent to $40.465 an
ounce on the Comex exchange in  New York . The contract was at
$41.72 as of 6 a.m. local time, for a three-day decline of 14
percent. Margin requirements were raised 38 percent in since
April 26. Gold futures retreated 0.2 percent to $1,537 an ounce.  “Some small, speculative players had to trim their silver
positions as they couldn’t afford to pay for such margins,”
said Jerome Berset, a portfolio manager at Palaedino Asset
Management SA in Geneva, which has 1 billion euros ($1.49
billion) in assets and has maintained holdings in gold and
silver. “For long-term players with fundamental views, this may
be a good time to get in for both silver and gold.”  The decade-long  bull market  in gold and silver attracted
fund managers from Soros to  John Paulson  and spurred central
banks to add to their reserves for the first time in a
generation. Investors in exchange-traded products backed by gold
accumulated more metal than all but four central banks, while
silver holdings are equal to more than eight months of global
mine supply, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Gold Reaches Record  Gold reached a record $1,577.57 an ounce on May 2, a
sixfold gain since prices bottomed in August 1999. Spot silver
rose to an all-time high of $49.79 an ounce on April 25, a 12-
fold advance from the low of $4.04 reached in 2001.  The Soros fund held 4.72 million SPDR Gold Trust shares as
of Dec. 31, equal to about 460,000 ounces, an  SEC filing  on Feb.
14 showed. It also owned 5 million shares in the iShares Gold
Trust, equal to about 48,800 ounces. The firm had 19,900 shares
in Pan American Silver Corp., a Vancouver-based company mining
the metal in  Mexico ,  Peru , Argentina and Bolivia. There were
also stakes in  Barrick Gold Corp. (ABX) ,  Kinross Gold Corp. (K)  and
 Novagold Resources Inc. (NG) , the filing shows.  Soros described gold at the World Economic Forum’s meeting
in Davos, Switzerland, in January last year as “the ultimate
asset bubble.” In a Nov. 15 speech in Toronto the 80-year-old
said conditions for the metal to keep rising were “pretty
ideal” and at this year’s Davos forum he said the boom in
commodities may last “a couple of years” longer.  Paulson Holding  Paulson & Co.’s holding was 31.5 million shares in SPDR
Gold at the end of December, an SEC filing shows.  Passport Capital Management LLC also sold some gold
holdings to lock in profit, the Wall Street Journal reported,
citing a person close to the fund. Passport Capital held 3
million put options on  SPDR Gold shares (GLD)  and 28,100 shares in
Barrick Gold as of Dec. 31, according an SEC filing. Two phone
calls outside of normal office hours to John Burbank, founder of
Passport Capital, weren’t answered.  CME Group Ltd., the owner of the Comex exchange, said this
week the minimum amount of cash that must be deposited when
borrowing from brokers to trade silver futures will rise to
$16,200 per contract at the close of business yesterday from
$14,513. A year ago, the margin was $4,250.  “Silver is often the lead indicator for changes in trends,
or at least for corrections,”  David Wilson , an analyst at
Societe Generale SA, wrote in a note. After futures rallied to a
record $50.35 an ounce in January 1980, prices dropped 78
percent in four months.  From the start of this year to the end of April, silver
futures rallied 57 percent and were the best performer among the
24 raw materials tracked by the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index.  Silver assets held in exchange traded products fell 1.1
percent to 15,169.80 metric tons yesterday, while gold holdings
stood little changed at 2,069.78 tons, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.
