SK Telecom Co., South Korea’s largest
mobile-phone operator, reported a 57 percent jump in first-
quarter profit, helped by sales of smartphones including  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  Net income rose to 537.3 billion won ($500 million) from
343.3 billion won a year earlier, the Seoul-based company said
in a regulatory filing today, based on International Financial
Reporting Standards adopted this year.  SK, which began selling the iPhone in March, expects to
surpass its target of 10 million smartphone subscribers by the
end of the year, the carrier said. The company plans to boost
capital spending to a record this year to upgrade networks and
manage a surge in data traffic from Web-connected handsets.  “Earnings will be good at least until the second
quarter,” said Kim Hue Jae, a Seoul-based analyst at Daishin
Securities Co. “Smartphones are behind their growth story.”  SK rose 0.6 percent to 166,000 won at the 3 p.m. close in
 Seoul  trading, while the benchmark Kospi index fell 0.9 percent.  Operating profit rose 29 percent to 614.3 billion won while
sales gained 3.8 percent to 3.91 trillion won. The sale of a
stake in SK C&C Co. helped boost earnings, the carrier said.  Smartphones  Under the new reporting standard, SK’s 2010 operating
profit increased by about 300 billion won and net income rose by
about 500 billion won, the company said. SK in January reported
an operating profit of 2 trillion won and net profit of 1.4
trillion won for 2010.  SK will offer about 30 new smartphones and tablet computers
this year as it seeks to tap demand for such devices, SK said in
January. Smartphone sales in South Korea surpassed 10 million
units as of the end of March, surging from 800,000 units at the
end of 2009, Ahn Jae Min, an analyst at Kiwoom Securities Co. in
Seoul, wrote in an April 20 report. SK currently has about 6
million smartphone subscribers, according to the company.  SK spent 785.4 billion won on marketing in the first
quarter and aims to increase  capital spending  this year to 2.3
trillion won, 15 percent more than a previous forecast, the
company said.  In the second quarter, SK may be able to spend less on
marketing to avoid losing customers to  KT Corp. (030200) , which had been
the exclusive provider of the iPhone, said Choi Nam Kon, a
Seoul-based analyst at Tong Yang Securities Inc.  Government Pressure  Earnings growth may be capped by the government’s push to
reduce phone bills for consumers as part of efforts to curb
inflation, according to Kiwoom Securities’ Ahn, who wrote in the
April 20 report that such a move is negative for carriers.  The communications commission is considering making mobile-
phone text messages free of charge, Choi See Joong, chairman of
 South Korea ’s telecommunications regulator, said April 13.  The regulator’s plan won’t likely materialize, as revenue
from text messages accounts for as much as 4 percent of phone
carriers’ sales, Ahn said. A more realistic option for the
government is to order phone companies to lower subscription
fees and offer more free calls, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
