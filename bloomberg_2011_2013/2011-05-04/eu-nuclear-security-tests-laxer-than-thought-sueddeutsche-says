The European Union’s planned safety
checks on nuclear power plants will be less strict than
initially announced,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing
people familiar with the matter.  The tests will only cover threats from earthquakes, floods
and extreme temperature variations, according to the report. The
effects of terror attacks, operating errors and unexpected
emergency situations on the reactors’ cooling systems and power
supply won’t be tested EU-wide, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
