South Africa  will probably leave its
forecast for the country’s winter-wheat harvest unchanged, a
Bloomberg survey showed.  Farmers will collect 1.46 million metric tons of the grain,
the same as projected last month, according to the median
estimate of nine traders surveyed by Bloomberg News. Forecasts
ranged from 1.36 million tons to 1.46 million tons.  The government’s  Crop Estimates Committee  is scheduled to
release its final 2010 winter-wheat crop tomorrow at 3:30
p.m. Johannesburg time.  Wheat for July delivery, the most active contract on the
South African Futures Exchange, fell 4 rand, or 0.1 percent, to
3,060 rand ($462) a ton by 11:52 a.m. in Johannesburg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
