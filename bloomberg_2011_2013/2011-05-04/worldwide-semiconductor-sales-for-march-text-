Following is the text of the worldwide
semiconductor sales report.  The  Semiconductor Industry Association , representing U.S.
leadership in semiconductor manufacturing and design, today
announced that worldwide sales of semiconductors were $25.3
billion for the month of March 2011, a 2.5 percent increase from
the prior month when sales were $24.7 billion, and an increase
of 8.6 percent from March 2010 when sales were $23.2 billion.
Sales in the first quarter of 2011 reached $75.8 billion, an
increase of 8.6 percent over last year’s first quarter sales of
$69.8 billion and a sequential increase of 0.4 percent over the
prior quarter. All monthly sales numbers represent a three-month
moving average.  “At the close of the first quarter of this year we are very
encouraged by the performance of the global and domestic
semiconductor industry,” said Brian Toohey, president,
Semiconductor Industry Association. “Now more than ever, it’s
clear that the semiconductor industry is a force driving the  U.S.
economy  forward and out of the recent recession.”  Currently the industry is on track to outpace the growth
forecasts of the U.S. economy due to increased consumer and
business demand for high-quality electronics products and the
pervasive application of integrated circuits throughout most
industries. Additionally, stabilization of infrastructure and
ongoing recovery efforts in  Japan  have mitigated some of the
impact that the mid-March natural disaster could have had on the
semiconductor markets.  SOURCE: Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA)  To contact the reporter on this story:
