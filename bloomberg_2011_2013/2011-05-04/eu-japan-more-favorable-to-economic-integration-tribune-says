The European Union and  Japan  should
authorize planning for an Economic Integration Agreement at a
bilateral meeting at the end of the month,  La Tribune  said
today, citing an interview with Sumitomo Chemical Co. Ltd.
Chairman  Hiromasa Yonekura .  The automotive industry’s opposition to the proposal, which
blocked integration talks last year, has changed as European
auto companies are increasing their cooperation with Japanese
carmakers, the newspaper said, citing Yonekura, who is also
chairman of the Keidanren, Japan’s largest business lobby.  The group recommended raising the value-added tax
“gradually” to 10 percent from the current 5 percent level to
help fund rising costs linked to the earthquake, the newspaper
said, quoting Yonekura.  To contact the reporter on this story:
