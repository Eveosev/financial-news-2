An Azeri youth who called on his
Facebook friends in February to stage a “day of rage” protest
against the government of President  Ilham Aliyev  was sentenced
to 2 1/2 years in jail on drug charges.  The allegations against Jabbar Savalanli, 19, were
“groundless,” defense lawyer Asabali Mustafayev said by phone.
The defense team will appeal today’s verdict, he said.  Several dozen Savalanli supporters protested the conviction
outside the court in Sumqayit, Azerbaijan’s third-largest city,
chanting “Freedom,” according to a video on the website of the
Azeri-language service of Radio Free  Europe /Radio Liberty.
Police briefly detained seven protesters, Orkhan Mansurzade, an
Interior Ministry spokesman, told the radio station.  Azerbaijan’s political opposition is seeking to replicate
the uprisings that ousted rulers in Egypt and  Tunisia . Young
people, including Savalanli, started a campaign on the Facebook
Inc. social-networking website to hold nationwide protests.  Aliyev took over from his father in 2003 in the first
dynastic succession in a former Soviet republic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
