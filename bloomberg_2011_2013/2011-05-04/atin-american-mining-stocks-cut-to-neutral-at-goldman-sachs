(Corrects date of report to May 3 in second paragraph.)  Latin American metals and mining
stocks were cut to “neutral” at  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) ,
which cited high valuation and a weak outlook for steel prices.  “We are positive on  iron ore  but cautious on steel,”
Goldman Sachs analysts including Marcelo Aguiar wrote in a
research report dated May 3.  The bank cut its 12-month price estimate for  Gerdau SA (GGBR4) ’s
preferred shares to 22 reais from 27 reais, and Cia. Siderurgica
Nacional SA to 23 reais from 29 reais. Goldman Sachs has a
“neutral” recommendation on Gerdau and “sell” on CSN, as the
Brazilian steelmaker is known.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
