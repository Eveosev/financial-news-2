Portugal led a decline in the cost of
insuring European sovereign debt after the government reached an
agreement on a 78 billion-euro ($116 billion) bailout that will
allow more time for the country to reduce its  budget deficit .  Credit-default swaps on Portugal dropped 29 basis points to
620, according to CMA at 10:10 a.m. in London. An index insuring
high-yield corporate bonds fell to the lowest in more than three
years.  Portugal has until 2013 to cut its budget gap to 3 percent
from 9.1 percent of gross domestic product last year. The nation
has raised taxes and is already implementing the deepest
spending cuts in more than 30 years to counter a debt load that
its statistics institute estimated March 31 will reach 97.3
percent of GDP this year.  “Portugal appears to have been given more time which is
promising, but it still has a tough task ahead,” said  Gary Jenkins , head of fixed income at Evolution Securities Ltd. in
London.  Credit swaps on Ireland tumbled 26 basis points to 634,
according to CMA. Contracts on  Greece  declined 12.5 basis points
to 1,285.5,  Spain  fell 7 to 227 and  Italy  was 3 lower at 142.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40 companies with
mostly high-yield credit ratings fell 3 basis points to 349, the
lowest versus closing prices since Dec. 31, 2007, according to
JPMorgan Chase & Co. A decline signals improvement in
perceptions of  credit quality .  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings fell 1 basis point to 95, the lowest in
almost a month. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index of 25 banks
and insurers declined 5 to 125.5 and the subordinated index was
6 lower at 216.5.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.8 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
