Krung Thai Bank Pcl (KTB) ,  Thailand â€™s
second-biggest lender, hired Australia & New Zealand Banking
Group Ltd. and Standard Chartered Plc to help arrange a $100
million loan, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The three-year unsecured term facility will pay a margin of
90 basis points more than the London interbank offered rate, the
person said, asking not to be identified as details are private.
Banks committing $15 million or more will receive interest and
fees, for the so-called all-in payment, of 115 basis points more
than the benchmark rate, said the person.  Bangkok-based Krung Thai reported a 79 percent increase in
first-quarter profit last month as income from loans surged.
Companies in Thailand are borrowing more to expand in an economy
the government expects will grow 4.2 percent this year.  Krung Thai will use loan proceeds for working capital and
the bullet facility may be increased to $200 million, the person
said. The loan was marketed to lenders in Taipei on April 26 and
responses are due by May 24, the person said.  In a bullet loan money must be repaid in a lump-sum when
the facility matures.  To contact the reporter on this story:
