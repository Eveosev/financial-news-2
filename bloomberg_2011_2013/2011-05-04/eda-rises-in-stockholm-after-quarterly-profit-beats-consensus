Meda AB (MEDAA) ,  Sweden ’s second-largest
health-care company, rose the most in 11 weeks in Stockholm
trading after first-quarter profit beat analyst forecasts.  The stock advanced as much as 9.9 percent, its biggest
intraday gain since Feb. 14. Meda traded at 68 kronor, up 9.4
percent, at 2:20 p.m., giving the company a market value of 20.6
billion kronor ($3.4 billion).  Meda said today that net income rose to 375 million kronor
from 362 million kronor a year earlier, beating the 357 million-
kronor estimate in a Bloomberg survey of six analysts. Growth
was strong in emerging markets and over-the-counter, or OTC
products, Stockholm-based Meda said. To grow in the OTC area the
company completed the acquisition of Antula Holding AB in April
and also agreed to acquire global rights to Elidel skin cream
from Novartis AB.  “There is underlying growth in our product range, and we
have ensured access to several important growth opportunities,”
Chief Executive Officer Anders Loenner said in a statement.
