South African stocks fell to a three-
week low as concern mounted  China  may step up efforts to tame
inflation and after a report showed U.S. companies added fewer
jobs than economists forecast.   Anglo American Plc (AAL)  led the drop.  The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index retreated for a second
day, losing 1.5 percent to 31,856.64 at the 5 p.m. close in
Johannesburg. Anglo American, which makes up 11 percent of the
gauge and digs copper in  South America , slipped 1.9 percent to
331.50 rand, the lowest close since Dec. 15. BHP Billiton Plc ,
the world’s largest mining company, weakened 1.4 percent to
266.96 rand, the lowest since March 29.  Copper in  London  tumbled to a seven-week low on concern
that demand growth in China may be slowing amid high inventories
and the possibility that there may be further monetary
tightening in the world’s largest user.  The People’s Bank of China said stabilizing prices and
managing inflation expectations are “critical” after policy
makers from India and Brazil yesterday signaled further
tightening is possible. The U.S.’s ADP Employer Services tally
of jobs growth in April was 179,000, trailing the 198,000 median
forecast of economists in a survey.  Naspers Ltd. (NPN) , Africa’s largest media company, lost 3
percent to 375.09 rand, the biggest drop since April 12. Naspers
holds about 35 percent of Tencent Holdings Ltd., China’s biggest
Internet company.  To contact the reporter on this story:
