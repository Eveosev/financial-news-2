Shareholders of T-Hrvatski Telekom
d.d.,  Croatia ’s main phone company, approved a dividend payout
of 1.863 billion kuna ($374 million), or 22.76 kuna per share,
from last year’s profit.  The dividends will be paid out on May 23, shareholders
decided in a meeting in Zagreb today.  The company, which is 51 percent-owned by  Deutsche Telekom
AG (DTE) , posted 2010 net income of 1.864 billion kuna, or 9.5 percent
down from a year before. First-quarter profit fell 8.5 percent
to 351 million kuna as last year’s recession and special taxes
continue to erode revenue, the company said on April 28.  The company kept its leading position in the three main
markets for mobile, fixed-line and Internet services, Chief
Executive Officer Ivica Mudrinic said last week in a statement
to the  Zagreb stock exchange . A 7.9 percent growth in
residential mobile and 4.5 percent growth in business mobile
services partly compensated for an overall decline in the amount
of voice calls placed, he said.  The company’s application in September to take part in the
planned sale of  Kosovo ’s state-run telecommunications business
was put on hold after the change of government in the former
Yugoslav province, he said.  The shares opened at 258 kuna in Zagreb today, less than a
percent up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
