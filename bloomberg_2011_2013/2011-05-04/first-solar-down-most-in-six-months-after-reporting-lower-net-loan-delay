First Solar Inc. (FSLR) , the world’s largest
maker of thin-film solar modules, sank the most in six months
after reporting first-quarter profit fell 33 percent and
approval for a federal loan guarantee has taken longer than
expected.  First Solar was down $9.85, or 7.3 percent, to $124.81 as
of 10:49 a.m. on the Nasdaq Stock Market. Earlier, the shares
dropped as much as 7.7 percent, the biggest intra-day decline
since Oct. 29.  The 290-megawatt Agua Caliente plant that First Solar is
building for  NRG Energy Inc. (NRG)  in  Arizona  is awaiting final
approval for a U.S. Energy Department loan guarantee that may be
as high as $967 million. First Solar had expected the project to
receive financing during the second quarter, said Chief
Executive Officer Rob Gillette.  “The Agua Caliente DOE loan guarantee is progressing and
we expect the financing to close in late Q2 or early Q3,” he
said yesterday on a conference call with investors.  First-quarter profit dropped 33 percent, less than analysts
expected, as higher production offset a decline in prices, the
Tempe, Arizona-based company said in a statement. Slower-than-
expected sales during the quarter led to an increase in First
Solar’s inventory.  To contact the reporter on this story:
