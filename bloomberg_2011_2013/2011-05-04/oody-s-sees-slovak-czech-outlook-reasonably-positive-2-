The outlook for the Slovak and Czech
economies remains “reasonably positive” while  Hungary ’s growth
targets will probably be hard to reach this year, said  Anthony Thomas , a senior sovereign risk analyst at Moody’s Investors
Service.  The Czech economy should be “sufficiently” resilient to
cuts in government spending and an increase in the value-added
tax, Thomas said today in Prague at a conference. Hungary’s
growth targets will be “very” difficult to reach and the
country will probably need more fiscal measures.  “It’s very difficult to see the economy reaching the
forecasts which the government has based its fiscal-
consolidation program on,” Thomas said. “The government will
probably have to take more measures in order to get the
deficit down.”  Bulgaria’s budget deficit for this year “looks to be
heading below” 3 percent of gross domestic product, Thomas
noted.  To contact the reporters on this story:
