Argentina ’s billionaire Eskenazi
family is paying $1.3 billion to boost its stake to about 25
percent in  Repsol YPF SA (REP) ’s Argentine unit, according to YPF
Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Eskenazi.  Eskenazi, the head of the biggest Argentina-based company
by market value, signed the agreement to buy an additional 10
percent in  Madrid  today, he said in an e-mail to Bloomberg News.
The $1.3 billion price was set when Eskenazi’s closely held
Petersen Group bought about 15 percent of YPF in 2008, with the
option to increase its stake to 25 percent by April next year.  The sale will lower Repsol’s stake in YPF to 58.23 percent
as the oil producer seeks to reduce its exposure to mature  oil
fields  in Argentina and focus on crude production at its
developments located offshore  Brazil .  Buenos Aires-based YPF, the country’s largest private
employer, produces and processes about 50 percent of the South
American nation’s oil and controls about the same amount of the
domestic fuel market.  YPF’s American depositary receipts fell 16 cents, or 0.4
percent, to close at $41.09 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The stock earlier climbed 1.5
percent to $41.88 when the stake purchase was announced.  Repsol also sold a 15.77 percent stake in YPF in the past
six months through private placements and share offerings. YPF
accounted for about 35 percent of Repsol’s revenue and more than
60 percent of its oil production until last year.  Brazilian Unit  Repsol is increasingly focusing on its Brazilian unit,
where the company operates the offshore Guara and Carioca
fields, located near Rio de Janeiro-based Petroleo Brasileiro
SA’s Tupi field, one of the largest discoveries in the Western
Hemisphere since  Mexico ’s Cantarell in 1976. Last year, Repsol
sold a 40 percent stake in the Brazilian unit to China Petroleum
& Chemical Corp. for $7.1 billion.  Repsol bought YPF in 1999 and crude output declined every
year since then except in 2003. In December, Sebastian Eskenazi
announced a 100 percent annual reserve-replacement ratio for the
first time in 13 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
