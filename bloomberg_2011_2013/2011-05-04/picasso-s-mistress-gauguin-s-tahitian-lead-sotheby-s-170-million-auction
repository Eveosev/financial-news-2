Sotheby’s (BID)  sold $170.5 million of
Impressionist and modern art last night in an unspectacular
sale led by a Picasso portrait.  The tally, the smallest for a Sotheby’s  New York 
evening Impressionist sale in two years, was at the low end
of the presale range of $159 million to $230 million.  “There is a big price differential between a star
painting and a very good painting,” said Nicholas Maclean,
a private dealer. “There are some very good things
tonight.”  Agent Morton Janklow and investor  Wilbur Ross  were
among those in the Manhattan salesroom. An Asian man
dressed in black jeans and shirt paid $21.4 million for a
1934 Picasso painting “Femmes lisant (Deux personnages)”
of his lover, Marie-Therese Walter, and another woman
reading. The price fell short of the low estimate of $25
million. The buyer declined, through an interpreter, to
comment.  A Paul Gauguin wooden bust of a young Tahitian woman,
“Jeune Tahitienne,” fetched $11.3 million, breaking the
$1.5 million auction record for a Gauguin sculpture.  The work, made during the French artist’s first trip
to Tahiti between 1890 and 1893, received no bids in the
salesroom. It had been guaranteed that price through a
third-party “irrevocable bid.”  Gauguin sculptures rarely come up at auction, which
makes them difficult to price, dealers said. In 1961, this
one fetched 11,500 pounds at Sotheby’s in  London , or about
$330,000 today, adjusting for inflation.  Paul Delvaux  A 6-foot-long canvas by Belgian Surrealist Paul
Delvaux depicting naked and topless classical beauties,
fetched $9 million after an energetic bidding war among
telephone clients represented by Alina Davey from Sotheby’s
Russian department in London and Victoria Gelfand, Belarus-
born director at Gagosian gallery, who works with the art
dealer’s Russian clients.  Gelfand won the battle. The result surpassed the lot’s
presale estimate of $3 million to $5 million and set an
auction record for the artist.  Davey’s Russian clients snapped up two works by Dali
and one by Giacometti, totaling $11 million. A telephone
bidder, working through Mikhail Kamensky, managing director
of Sotheby’s in  Russia , won a small 1901 flower painting by
Picasso for $3.7 million.  The sale kicked off two weeks of art sales in New York
that auctioneers expect to tally as much as $1.4 billion.  Sotheby’s charges buyers 25 percent of the hammer
price up to $50,000, plus 20 percent from $50,000 to $1
million, plus 12 percent above $1 million.  To contact the reporters of this story:
