Gecina SA (GFC) ,  France ’s second-largest
publicly traded property company, said earnings excluding
changes in asset values and other items fell 7.6 percent in the
first quarter as the cost of paying its debt increased.  The profit measure, known as recurrent income, declined to
83.7 million euros ($124 million), or 1.37 euros a share, from
90.6 million euros, or 1.49 euros, a year earlier, the Paris-
based company said in a statement today. Gecina doesn’t revalue
its real estate on a quarterly basis.  The company forecast a 7 percent drop in recurrent income
for 2011 when it released full-year earnings Feb. 24, citing
higher interest-rate payments. Chief Executive Officer
Christophe Clamageran is part way through a 1 billion-euro
disposal program as he focuses Gecina on offices, apartment
buildings and properties related to health care in France.  Higher  interest rates  lifted Gecina’s average cost of
borrowing by 46 basis points to 3.99 percent. The company’s
financial expenses rose by 24 percent to 45 million euros. A
basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  Rental income fell 1.4 percent to 157.9 million euros, hurt
by automatic inflation adjustments on leases for offices and
logistics properties. The average vacancy rate fell to 3.8
percent from 5.7 percent three months earlier.  Gecina sold or agreed to sell 295 million euros of property
during the first three months of 2011, reducing net rental
income by 7.1 million euros. The company made acquisitions worth
44 million euros in the quarter and plans to purchase an
additional 230 million euros of health care-related properties
by the end of the second quarter.  Focus on Paris  Clamageran, who joined Gecina in November 2009, aims to
increase Paris region office projects and developments by 80
percent to 9 billion euros by 2014.  Gecina gained more than 11 percent in the three months
through May 3, in line with the gains for an index of French
real estate investment trust stocks compiled by Amsterdam-based
Global Property Research.  To contact the reporter on this story:
