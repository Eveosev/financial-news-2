German two-year notes fell, pushing
the yield spread with 10-year bunds to the narrowest in more
than two years, amid speculation the  European Central Bank  will
signal further interest-rate increases tomorrow.  Losses today pushed the two-year note yield to the highest
in almost three weeks. Portuguese bonds rose, with the two-year
yield falling the most in more than five months, as the nation
announced a European Union-led rescue loan agreement of as much
as 78 billion euros ($116 billion). The ECB is due to announce
its latest rate decision tomorrow after tightening by 0.25
percentage point last month, amid signs that the recovery in the
stronger economies such as  Germany  will be sustained.  “We’ve had robust economic data and inflation pushing
higher, so the prospect for the ECB to be more hawkish at the
next meeting is higher,” said  Patrick Jacq , a senior fixed-
income strategist at BNP Paribas SA in Paris. “When you have
the ECB starting a tightening cycle, you have more pressure at
the front end than the long end. The bias for the month ahead
remains for more flattening.”  The yield on the two-year note gained five basis points to
1.93 percent at 3:30 p.m. in London, after reaching 1.94
percent, the most since April 11. The 1.5 percent security due
March 2013 fell 0.09, or 90 euro cents per 1,000-euro ($1,481)
face amount, to 99.225. The 10-year bund yield rose for a third
day, climbing one basis point to 3.29 percent.  Yield Spread  The moves left the extra yield investors demand to hold the
longer-dated securities at 137 basis points, the least since
January 2009, according to closing prices. The 10-year bund
yielded five basis points more than similar-maturity U.S.
Treasuries. The yield rose above the U.S. equivalent yesterday
for the first time since June 2009.  A composite index based on a survey of euro-area purchasing
managers in services and manufacturing industries was at 57.8
last month, above the 50 level that marks expansion, London-
based  Markit Economics  said today, matching the median
prediction of 14 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News and an
initial estimate on April 19. A report yesterday showed European
producer-price inflation unexpectedly accelerated to the fastest
pace in 2 1/2 years in March.  Euribor futures dropped, sending the implied yield on
contracts expiring in December seven basis points higher to 2.18
percent, as investors added to wagers on higher rates from the
Frankfurt-based ECB.  Portuguese Agreement, Sale  German  government bonds  have handed investors a loss of 1.8
percent this year through yesterday, according to indexes
compiled by the European Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies and Bloomberg, while Treasuries have returned 1.4
percent. Spanish bonds made 2.7 percent while Portuguese debt
lost 15 percent.  The yield on the Portuguese two-year note dropped as much
as 69 basis points, the most since Dec. 2, to 11.13 percent.
Ten-year bonds rose for a fourth day, pushing the yield down 11
basis points to 9.46 percent. The securities yielded 616 basis
points more than bunds, from 630 basis points yesterday. The
spread reached a euro-era record of 640 basis points on May 29.  Portugal  also led a decline in the cost of insuring
European sovereign debt. Credit-default swaps on Portugal
dropped 29 basis points to 620, according to CMA. An index
insuring high-yield corporate bonds fell to the lowest in more
than three years.  “The spreads are tightening a bit, so in that sense it’s
seen as a slight relief that there’s some agreement,” said
 Karsten Linowsky , a fixed-income strategist at Credit Suisse
Group AG in Zurich. “They still have a lot of challenges.”  Credible Plan  Portugal needs a “credible plan” to bring its deficit
under control if it is to regain access to financial markets,
 Anthony Thomas , a senior sovereign risk analyst at Moody’s
Investors Service, said today in an interview in Prague.  Borrowing costs rose at a Portuguese sale of 1.12 billion
euros of three-month bills. The securities due in August were
issued at an average yield of 4.652 percent, the Treasury said
today. That compares with a yield of 4.046 percent at the
previous auction of three-month bills on April 20. The auction
attracted bids for 1.9 times the amount offered, compared with a
bid-to-cover ratio of two last month.  Portugal in April became the third euro-region country to
request EU aid after Greece and Ireland. The three-year plan set
goals for a budget deficit of 5.9 percent of gross domestic
product this year, 4.5 percent in 2012 and 3 percent in 2013,
Prime Minister Jose Socrates said in Lisbon.  Spanish 10-year bonds advanced, sending the yield one basis
point lower to 5.25 percent, and Irish 10-year yields slid 20
basis points to 10.18 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
