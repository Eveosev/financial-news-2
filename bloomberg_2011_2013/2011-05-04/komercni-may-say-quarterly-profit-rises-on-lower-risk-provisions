Komercni Banka AS (KOMB) , the Czech unit of
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, may say its first quarter profit rose as
provisions for bad loans declined.  Net income for three months ended March 31 probably was
3.45 billion koruna ($211.5 million) compared with 3.21 billion
koruna a year earlier according to a Bloomberg survey of five
analysts.  Czech banks benefited from a decline of bad corporate loans
and first-quarter economic growth, estimated by the Czech
national Bank at 2.5 percent. Rival lender Erste’s Ceska
Sporitelna AS’ reported a profit gain of 21 percent last week.  Komercni said on February 16 cost growth may outstrip
revenue expansion this year. The economic recovery started to
generate business opportunities in late 2010, the Prague-based
lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story: Lenka Ponikelska in
