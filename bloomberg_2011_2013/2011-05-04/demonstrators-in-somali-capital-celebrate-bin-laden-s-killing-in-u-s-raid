Demonstrators gathered in the streets
of Mogadishu, Somalia, to celebrate the death of  Osama bin Laden , whose al-Qaeda terror group is accused of funding a local
militia.  The 54-year-old’s death after a U.S. raid on his compound
in  Pakistan  on May 1 is a “great success to the world and Islam
because he brought dishonor to Muslims,” said Abdulkadir Nor
Arale, a lawmaker who spoke to the crowd that gathered in the
government-controlled area of the city today.  Somalia’s government, led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, is
fighting insurgents including the al-Shabaab movement, which the
U.S. accuses of having links to al-Qaeda. Somalia has been
without a functioning central administration since 1991, when
ruler Mohamed Siad Barre was ousted.  Bin Laden’s death may weaken al-Shabaab, which receives
“financial and technical assistance” from al-Qaeda, the Walta
Information Center, based in neighboring  Ethiopia , reported
today, citing Prime Minister  Meles Zenawi ’s adviser Tsegay
Berhe.  The demonstration was organized by local government
officials and civil society groups to “express our moral support
for the killing of Osama bin Laden,” Muhudiin Hassan Afrah,
chairman of an umbrella group of civil society organizations,
told the Mogadishu crowd.  Sheikh Fuad Mohamed Qalaf, an al-Shabaab leader that the
Somali government claimed was killed, spoke to reporters in
Mogadishu today to deny the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
