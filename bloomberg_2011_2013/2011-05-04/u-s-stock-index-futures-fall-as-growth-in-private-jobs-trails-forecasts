U.S. stock-index futures were little
changed as takeovers in the packaged-food and computer-chip
industries bolstered optimism, tempering concern from smaller-
than-forecast growth in jobs.  Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates Inc. surged 52
percent after Applied Materials Inc. offered to buy the company
for $4.9 billion, while Ralcorp Holdings Inc. rallied 6.3
percent as ConAgra Foods Inc. bid a similar amount for the maker
of Post cereals.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in June
were little changed at 1,352 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York . Dow Jones
Industrial Average futures were unchanged at 12,749.  Futures fell earlier after figures from ADP Employer
Services showed employment at U.S. companies increased by
179,000 in April, trailing the median estimate in the Bloomberg
News survey for a 198,000 advance.  The  S&P 500  has rallied 7.9 percent this year as higher-
than-estimated profit and economic reports bolstered investors’
confidence. The gains pushed the gauge’s valuation last week to
about 15.5 times the reported operating earnings of its
companies, near the 2011 high of 15.8 reached in February.  Service industries  in the U.S. probably accelerated in
April, a sign the biggest part of the economy is weathering
increases in fuel prices, economists said before an Institute of
Supply Management report due at 10 a.m. New York time.  The Tempe, Arizona-based ISM’s index of non-manufacturing
companies rose to 57.5 from 57.3 in March, according to the
median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
