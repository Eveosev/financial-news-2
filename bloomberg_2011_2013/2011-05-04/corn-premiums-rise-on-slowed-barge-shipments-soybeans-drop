Cash premiums for corn shipped in May
to terminals near  New Orleans  rose relative to Chicago futures
as high river waters slowed or postponed barge shipments. The
soybeans basis dropped.  The spot-basis bid, or premium, for corn delivered this
month was 57 cents a bushel above July futures, up from 55 cents
to 57 cents yesterday, U.S. Department of Agriculture  data  show.
The soybean basis fell to 58 cents to 67 cents a bushel from 64
cents to 67 cents.  “The river shipping schedule is a mess, and that will
cause some problems,” said Bryce Stremming, a commodity risk
consultant for Mid-Co Commodities Inc. in Bloomington, Illinois.
“Soybean demand is slow,” with overseas buyers purchasing
cheaper supplies from record crops in  South America , he said.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to $7.295 a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade.  Soybean futures for July delivery dropped 11.75 cents, or
0.9 percent, to $13.52 a bushel, the third straight decline.  Farmer selling of corn and soybeans is very slow, further
reducing cash-grain trading, Stremming said. Farmers west and
north of Peoria,  Illinois , are planting corn actively with most
soils south and to the east too wet for farm machinery, he said.  “Cash markets will be quiet until farmers finish
planting,” which has been delayed by adverse weather the past
three weeks, Stremming said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
