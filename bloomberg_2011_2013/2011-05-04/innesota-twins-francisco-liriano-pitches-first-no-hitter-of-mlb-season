Francisco Liriano pitched the first
no-hitter of the Major League Baseball season as the  Minnesota 
Twins beat the Chicago White Sox 1-0.  Liriano threw the  first no-hitter for Minnesota since Eric
Milton on Sept. 11, 1999.  There were five no-hitters in last year’s regular season,
with  Roy Halladay  of the  Philadelphia Phillies  and  Dallas Braden 
of the  Oakland Athletics  throwing perfect games. Halladay also
had the second no-hitter in postseason history.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
