Honda Motor Co.’s exports from
 Thailand  grew 5 percent in the first quarter, the company said
today in a statement.  Honda’s exports from the Southeast Asian nation rose to 26
billion baht in the first three months. Motorcycle shipments
grew 45 percent in value from a year earlier, and auto exports
fell 15 percent because of “weakness in several key export
markets,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
