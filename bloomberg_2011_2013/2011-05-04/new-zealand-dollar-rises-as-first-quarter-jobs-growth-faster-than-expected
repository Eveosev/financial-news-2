The  New Zealand dollar  rose after a
government report showed employers added jobs in the first
quarter at more than twice the pace economists had estimated.  The so-called kiwi climbed to 79.41 U.S. cents as of 10:48
a.m. in Wellington from 79.07 cents before the data. Jobs grew
1.4 percent in the three months ended March 31, from the
previous quarter, compared with the median estimate for 0.6
percent from economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.  To contact the reporter on this story:
