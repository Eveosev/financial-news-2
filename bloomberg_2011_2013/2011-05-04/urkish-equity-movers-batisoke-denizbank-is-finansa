Turkey’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  fell for the first day in five, dropping 634.48, or 0.9
percent, to 69,437.55 at the 5:30 p.m. close in Istanbul.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Batisoke Soke Cimento Sanayii TAS (BSOKE)  , a cement
maker, gained 2 kurus, or 1 percent, to 1.99 liras, rising for
the fifth day. Turkey’s asset sales agency invited its energy
unit Baticim Enerji to buy two power plants by a July 4
deadline, the company said in a filing with the exchange today.
The winner of the auction, Akfen Holding, failed to pay by a May
2 deadline, leaving Baticim eligible to buy as the second-
highest bidder.  Denizbank AS (DENIZ)  , the Turkish unit of  Dexia SA (DEXB) , rose
as much as 4.8 percent, the most since March 23, and climbed 0.9
percent to 11.65 liras at the close of trade. Denizbank expects
“good” profits at Turkish banks in the first quarter because
central bank measures to curb loan growth have yet to have an
impact, chief executive Hakan Ates said at a news conference in
Istanbul today.  Is Finansal Kiralama AS (ISFIN)  , a leasing company,
climbed 2 kurus, or 1.2 percent, to 1.71 liras. The government
will cut the  sales tax  on leasing of machinery to 1 percent,
Haberturk newspaper reported today citing Industry Minister
Nihat Ergun.  To contact the reporter on this story:
