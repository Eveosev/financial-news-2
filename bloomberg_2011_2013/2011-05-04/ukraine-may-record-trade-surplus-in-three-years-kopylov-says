Ukraine may post a  trade surplus  in
three years as the government will boost exports and cut
imports, Deputy Economy Minister Vadym Kopylov said.  The former Soviet republic may have a trade surplus of
between  $400 million to $500 million in 2015, Kopylov said
today in a statement on the Economy Ministry’s  website .  Kopylov said Ukraine’s $1.6 billion trade deficit in the
first quarter of this year was caused by natural gas imports
from  Russia , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
