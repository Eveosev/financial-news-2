CEZ AS (CEZ) , the  Czech Republic ’s largest
electricity producer, plans this year to invest as much as 11.3
billion koruna ($694 million) into its domestic distribution
network to improve the reliability of the grid.  The budget for the network will exceed last year’s
investments by 35 million koruna, the Prague-based utility said
today in an e-mailed statement.  CEZ, which is 70-percent owned by the Czech state, has
invested 613 million koruna since the beginning of 2010 to
accommodate the growing number of solar power plants, Richard
Vidlicka, the distribution unit’s director, said in the
statement. The company continues to invest into so-called smart
grids, it said.  CEZ shares rose 0.5 percent to 940.6 koruna at 11:26 a.m.
in Prague. The stock has gained 20 percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
