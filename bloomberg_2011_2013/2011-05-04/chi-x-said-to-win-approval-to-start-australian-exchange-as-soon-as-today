Chi-X Global Inc. may win approval as
soon as today to become the first foreign-owned stock-exchange
operator, a person familiar with the matter said, as the country 
seeks to become a trading hub for  Asia .  Financial Services Minister Bill Shorten, who is in Hanoi
attending the Asian Development Bank’s annual gathering, will
announce the decision as soon as later today, said the person,
who declined to be named because the decision isn’t yet public.
Chi-X Global has previously said it plans for the new market
operator, Chi-X Australia Pty, to begin trading in the fourth
quarter.  The  Australian Securities & Investments Commission  in March
announced a timetable for the licensing of competitors for the
dominant bourse operator  ASX Ltd. (ASX) , part of a plan by the
Labor Government, led by Prime Minister  Julia Gillard , to help
turn the country into a global financial hub.  Australian Treasurer Wayne Swan on April 8 rejected
 Singapore Exchange Ltd. (SGX) ’s A$8.3 billion ($9 billion) takeover
bid for ASX, saying the deal wasn't in his nation’s interest
and would have left the local bourse operator as a junior
partner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
