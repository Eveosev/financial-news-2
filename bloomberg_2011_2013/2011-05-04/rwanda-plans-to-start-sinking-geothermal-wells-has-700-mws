Rwanda  plans to start drilling
exploratory geothermal wells in an area that may have at least
700 megawatts of steam power, following in the footsteps of
neighboring Kenya, Energy Minister Coletha Ruhamya said.  Rwanda lies within the same Great Rift Valley fault system
as Kenya, where shifting tectonic plates provide sizeable
reserves of geothermal energy. Kenya,  Africa ’s biggest
geothermal power producer, estimates the extent of its untapped
power resources at as much as 10,000 megawatts, enough to meet
its own electricity needs and export the surplus.  “Geothermal is the area that the government of Rwanda
wants to prioritize,” Ruhamya said, according to a statement e-
mailed from the Nairobi-based  Geothermal Development Co.  today.
“Since  Kenya  has progressed far in the area, we are looking for
collaboration and partnership in capacity building, drilling and
putting plants in place.”  Ruhamya made the comments in a meeting yesterday with her
Kenyan counterpart Kiraitu Murungi, according to the statement.
She didn’t say when drilling may start. The New Times newspaper
reported on March 10 that the country would start digging wells
in August, citing Ruhamya.  Experts from Kenya’s state-run Geothermal Development Co.
are currently training 12 Rwandese students on how geothermal
technology works, today’s statement said.  Investigations into Rwanda’s geothermal potential began in
1982 with the north-western Volcanoes National Park and areas
around Lake Kivu identified as possible sites, according to the
energy ministry’s website.  To contact the reporters on this story:
