About 90 South African clothing
factories plan a two-day work stoppage this week to show
sympathy with rivals closed by the government for paying wages
below the required minimum rate,  Business Report  said.  Two factories were shut yesterday and four more will be
closed this week, the Johannesburg-based newspaper said, citing
Ahmed Paruk, chairman of the United Clothing and Textile
Association. The six factories employ about 2,000 people,
 Business Report  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
