Argentine refinery and natural-gas
plant workers will meet with employers including Repsol  YPF SA (YPF) 
and Royal Dutch Shell Plc to demand a 36 percent salary
increase, according to a union official.  “We are asking for 36 percent more and the companies are
offering 24 percent,” Juan Ayala, an official with the
Argentine Oil, Gas and Biofuel Federationn, said in a telephone
interview from Buenos Aires. “There are about 6,000 gas workers
and 8,000 refinery workers in the union,” he said.  A 15-day compulsory talk period, during which workers are
not allowed to strike, set by the Labor Ministry comes to an end
today, Ayala said. The ministry can set an additional five-day
period, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
