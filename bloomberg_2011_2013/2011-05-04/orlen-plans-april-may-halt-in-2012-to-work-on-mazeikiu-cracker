PKN Orlen SA plans a shutdown at its
Mazeikiu refinery in  Lithuania  in April and May of 2012 to
replace parts of the fluid catalytic cracking unit.  The refinery didn’t specify the length of the shutdown,
according to a letter inviting companies to bid in a tender for
the construction work. It was posted on the website of Orlen
Lietuva, the  Lithuanian unit  of  Poland ’s largest oil company.  The cracker, originally designed to process 2 million metric
tons of oil products a year, now handles about 2.6 million tons
annually, Orlen Lietuva said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
