Coffee growers in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, are accelerating the harvest of arabica beans
to take advantage of the current high prices, according to
Cepea, a University of Sao Paulo research group.  Arabica coffee for July delivery touched $3.089 a pound
yesterday on ICE Futures U.S. in  New York , the highest since May
1997. The price fell 0.2 percent to $3.056 a pound in New York
by 10:18 a.m. London time. Arabica coffee is grown mainly in
 Latin America  and brewed by specialty companies including
Starbucks Corp.  “Some small volumes of the 2011-12 season have been placed
to trade,” Margarete Boteon, an analyst at Cepea, wrote in a
report yesterday. “Growers are advancing the harvest aiming to
take advantage of current prices.”  Harvesting of robusta beans, the typed used in instant
coffee, continued to be delayed by rains in the state of
Espirito Santo, the country’s main producing region of the
variety. “Rains have not allowed advances in harvesting
activities of the new season,” Boteon wrote in the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
