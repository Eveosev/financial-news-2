Safaricom Ltd. (SAFCOM) , Kenya’s biggest
mobile-phone operator, erased an earlier loss prompted by its
plans to take legal action against the administrators of a new
mobile number portability system.  The stock dropped as much as 5 cents, or 1.3 percent, to
3.95 shillings and closed unchanged at 4 shillings as of 3 p.m.
in Nairobi today.  Safaricom instructed lawyers to start legal action against
Porting Access, the local unit of Netherlands-based Porting XS
BV that is managing Kenya’s mobile number portability system
that began operating last month, over accusations of defamation
and economic sabotage, it said in an e-mailed statement dated
yesterday.  “What normally happens when you start legal action against
third parties is that investors become jittery because it
highlights negative issues in the company and industry,”
Francis Mwangi, an analyst with African Alliance Securities
 Kenya  Ltd. in Nairobi, the capital, said by phone today.  No one was available to comment when Bloomberg News called
Porting XS’s head office in the Netherlands today, according to
a receptionist who declined to be identified in line with
company policy. The request for a comment would be forwarded to
the local office, she said, declining to provide their contact
details.  To contact the reporter on this story:
