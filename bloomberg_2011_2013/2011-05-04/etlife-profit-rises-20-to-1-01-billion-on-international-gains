MetLife Inc. (MET) , the largest U.S. life
insurer, said first-quarter profit climbed 20 percent on higher
international revenue and investment income after buying a unit
from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)   Net income rose to $1.01 billion, or 78 cents a share, from
$835 million, or 97 cents, a year earlier when there were fewer
shares outstanding, the New York-based company said today in a
statement. Operating profit, which excludes some investment
results, was $1.33 a share, beating the $1.26 average estimate
of 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Steven Kandarian, 59, took over as chief executive officer
this month after six years heading the company’s investment
portfolio. MetLife selected Steven J. Goulart, 52, to replace
him as chief investment officer, after Goulart helped secure the
purchase of American Life Insurance Co. from New York-based AIG
for about $16 billion.  “The Alico acquisition is completely altering their
business mix,” John Nadel, an analyst at Sterne Agee & Leach
Inc., said before the earnings were released. Nadel has a buy
rating on the stock.  MetLife has climbed about 3.9 percent this year on the  New
York  Stock Exchange, compared with the 4.3 percent climb of the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Insurance Index. Results were released
after the close of regular trading.  Premiums, fees and other revenue rose 27 percent to a
record $11 billion, from $8.66 billion. International revenue
more than tripled to $3.8 billion.  Earthquake Costs  MetLife said the March 11 Japanese earthquake will reduce
second-quarter after-tax operating earnings by $45 million to
$65 million, on additional claims and higher expenses.  Book value per share, a measure of assets minus
liabilities, rose 2.4 percent to $45.24 in the first three
months of 2011. MetLife had $254 million in derivatives losses
in the first quarter as  interest rates  rose and the  U.S. dollar 
weakened. In the same period of 2010, the company reported $19
million of losses on the contracts.  Net investment income rose 14 percent to $4.9 billion from
$4.34 billion a year earlier. MetLife said variable investment
income, a category that includes buyout and hedge funds, jumped
38 percent to $434 million on gains from private-equity funds.  Premiums, fees and other revenue in the U.S. slipped to
$7.0 billion from $7.4 billion on a decline of sales at the
operation selling life policies to groups and individuals.  MetLife added 20 million customers in the fourth quarter
with the purchase of Alico, which boosted the company’s presence
in insurance markets from  Chile  to  Japan .  MetLife sold 68.6 million shares for $2.97 billion in March
to raise funds to repurchase and cancel convertible preferred
shares owned by New York-based AIG. AIG sold 78.2 million shares
and 40 million common equity units of MetLife for $6.7 billion,
liquidating the securities it received in the Alico deal.  Robert Henrikson, 63, MetLife’s previous CEO, will remain
chairman this year. He reaches mandatory  retirement age  in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
