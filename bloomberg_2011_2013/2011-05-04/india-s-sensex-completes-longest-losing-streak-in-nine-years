India ’s benchmark stock index, the
worst-performer this year in Asia, dropped for an eighth day,
its longest losing streak in nine years, amid concern inflation
will hurt economic growth and corporate earnings.  Hero Honda Motors Ltd. (HH) , the nation’s biggest motorcycle
maker, dropped after its fourth quarter profit missed analyst
estimates. India’s central bank may need to increase  interest
rates  more than previously expected given excess demand and the
rise in global commodity prices, Nomura Holdings Inc. said
today. The  Reserve Bank  of India increased the benchmark
repurchase rate by half a percentage point to 7.25 percent
yesterday, the biggest move since July 2008, and Governor
Duvvuri Subbarao forecast the economy may grow about 8 percent
in the year through March from 8.6 percent in the previous year.
 Housing Development Finance Corp. (HDFC) , the biggest mortgage lender,
fell to a six-week low.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
74.07, or 0.4 percent, to 18,460.62, according to preliminary
closing prices at 3:30 p.m. in Mumbai. The gauge completed its
biggest stretch of losses since May 2002 and is at its lowest
level since March 24. The S&P CNX Nifty Index on the National
Stock Exchange dropped 0.5 percent to 5,537.30 and its May
futures settled at 5,536. The BSE 200 Index retreated 0.5
percent to 2,280.10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
