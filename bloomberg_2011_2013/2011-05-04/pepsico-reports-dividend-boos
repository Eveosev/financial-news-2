PepsiCo Inc., the world’s largest
snack-food maker, increased its annual dividend for the 39th
consecutive year, by 7.3 percent, after reporting a 27 percent
jump in first-quarter sales last week.  The Purchase, New York-based company will give holders of
common stock $2.06 a share, up from a payout of $1.92 last year,
according to a statement today.  PepsiCo, led by Chief Executive Officer  Indra Nooyi , on
April 28 said sales rose to $11.9 billion in the first quarter.
The company has developed new flavors to appeal to markets
internationally, and volume in the Latin American foods business
climbed 2 percent.  “The board’s decision to once again raise the annual
dividend reflects our confidence in both the near- and long-term
growth of our business as well as our ongoing commitment to
delivering strong cash returns to shareholders,” Nooyi said in
the statement.  The quarterly dividend of $0.515 a share is payable on June
30 to investors holding stock as of June 3. Bloomberg analysts
had projected a dividend of 52 cents a share.  PepsiCo climbed 24 cents, or 0.3 percent, to $69.83 at 4:01
p.m. in  New York  Stock Exchange composite trading. The stock has
gained 6.7 percent in the past year, compared with a 27 percent
jump for  Coca-Cola Co. (KO)   To contact the reporter on this story:
