Companies in the U.S. added workers in
April, signaling the labor market is strengthening, data from a
private report based on payrolls showed today.  Employment increased by 179,000 in April from a revised
207,000 the prior month, according to figures from ADP Employer
Services. The median estimate in the Bloomberg News survey
called for a 198,000 advance this month.  The gain in employment projected by ADP may be insufficient
to help the economy accelerate after a surge in food and fuel
costs caused growth to slow to a 1.8 percent annual rate in the
first three months of the year. Businesses added 200,000 jobs in
April and the jobless rate held at 8.8 percent, economists project
a Labor Department report to show in two days.  “This pace keeps things moving forward but not at a strong
enough growth rate to really, really improve labor market
conditions and improve the economy,” said Steven Ricchiuto,
chief economist at Mizuho Securities USA Inc. in  New York  who
forecast a gain of 175,000. “The labor market is still
underperforming the expectations where growth will be and should
be at this point.”  Estimates for the ADP data ranged from increases of 164,000
to 240,000, according to the Bloomberg survey of 34 economists.  Over the previous six reports, ADP’s initial figure was
closest to the Labor Department’s first estimate of private
payrolls in February, when it understated the gain in jobs by
5,000. The estimate was least accurate in December, when it
overestimated the increase in employment by 184,000.  Fewer Firings  Another report today showed U.S. employers announced fewer
job cuts in April than the same month last year, a sign that the
labor market is firming. Planned firings decreased 4.8 percent
to 36,490 last month from April 2010, according to Chicago-based
Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. Government agencies accounted
for the biggest cutbacks by industry.  Stock-index futures were little changed after the report.
The contract on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index maturing in June
was at 1,352.1 at 8:58 a.m. in New York, matching yesterday’s
close.  Today’s ADP report showed an increase of 41,000 workers in
goods-producing industries, which includes manufacturers and
construction companies. Employment at factories rose by 25,000.  Service providers added 138,000 workers, ADP said.  Companies employing more than 499 workers expanded their
workforces by 11,000 jobs. Medium-sized businesses, with 50 to
499 employees, created 84,000 jobs and small companies also
increased payrolls by 84,000, ADP said.  Economy Recovering  “Employment has begun to show signs of improvement,”
Scott Davis, chief executive officer of  United Parcel Service
Inc. (UPS) , said during an April 26 call with analysts. “In the U.S.,
unemployment dipped below 9 percent for the first time in almost
two years, further evidence that the recovery continues.”  While payrolls have grown each month since October, Federal
Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  said on April 27 that central
bankers would like to see more strength in the U.S. labor
market, noting that a recovery has been “quite slow.”  “The labor market is improving gradually,” Bernanke said
to reporters during the first-ever press conference following a
Federal Open Market Committee meeting. “We would like to make
sure that that is sustainable. The longer it goes on, the more
confident we are.”  ‘Anemic’ Recovery  Federal  Reserve Bank  of  Boston  President Eric Rosengren
today said record stimulus is necessary to spur the “anemic”
economy and that raising  interest rates  to combat increasing
food and fuel prices would impede growth.  “With significant slack in labor markets, stable inflation
expectations, and  core inflation  well below our longer run
target, there is currently no reason to slow the economy down
with tighter monetary policy,” Rosengren said in prepared
remarks for a speech in Boston.  Overall payrolls, which include government workers,
probably rose by 185,000 in April, according to the median
forecast of economists surveyed before the Labor Department’s
May 6 report.  The ADP report is based on data from about 340,000
businesses employing more than 21 million workers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
