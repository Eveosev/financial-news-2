Ted Forstmann , the dealmaker who
helped create the leveraged-buyout business, is undergoing
treatment for  brain cancer , according to a person familiar with
the matter.  Forstmann, chairman and chief executive officer of  IMG
Worldwide Inc. , the sports agency that represents athletes
including Tiger Woods and  Roger Federer , found out about the
cancer recently and has had surgery, said the person, who
declined to be identified because the matter is private.  Forstmann, 71, co-founded his buyout firm, Forstmann Little
& Co., in 1978, two years after rival  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &
Co.  was created. KKR later established its reputation by winning
the $30.1 billion buyout of RJR Nabisco Inc. in 1989, a deal
that Forstmann lost.  “Ted Forstmann, IMG’s chairman and chief executive, is
currently dealing with some serious personal health issues,”
Jim Gallagher, spokesman for New York-Based IMG, said today in a
telephone interview. “The details of those health issues are a
private matter. Ted is coming to the office every day, and it is
business as usual at IMG.”  Forstmann Little’s average annual return in its first two
decades was 50 percent, and was among the first to raise money
for acquisitions directly from pension funds. Forstmann’s
purchases include 24 Hour Fitness Worldwide Inc., which his firm
bought in 2005 for $1.6 billion, and a $1.5 billion cash
investment in  XO Communications , which later filed for
bankruptcy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
