Deutsche Boerse AG (DB1) ’s proposed merger
with  NYSE Euronext (NYX)  offers better long-term value and is more
feasible than an offer by  Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. (NDAQ)  and
 IntercontinentalExchange Inc. (ICE) ,  Le Figaro  said today, citing an
interview with Dominique Cerutti, deputy chief executive officer
at NYSE Euronext.  The  Deutsche Boerse  offer to form the world’s largest
exchange owner would better serve French companies and would be
less of a threat to French jobs at the exchange, Cerutti said,
according to the newspaper. The Nasdaq and ICE bid focuses
“strictly on the creation of very short term value” and the
plan to finance it with debt could put its rating at risk,
Figaro quoted Cerutti as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
