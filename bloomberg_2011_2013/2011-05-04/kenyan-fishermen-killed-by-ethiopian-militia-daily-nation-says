At least 18 people died in
northwestern  Kenya  when bandits from neighboring  Ethiopia 
attacked a group of fishermen, the  Daily Nation  reported, citing
a relief agency.  Suspected members of the Merille militia carried out the
raid while the men were resting after fishing at Todonyang, an
area rich in fish and a source of conflict between the Turkana
ethnic group and the Merille, the Nairobi-based newspaper said,
citing Peter Moru of the Lokichoggio Catholic Justice and Peace
Commission.  Turkana Central lawmaker Ekwee Ethuro said 35 people were
killed in the attack, which he blamed on cattle rustlers, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
