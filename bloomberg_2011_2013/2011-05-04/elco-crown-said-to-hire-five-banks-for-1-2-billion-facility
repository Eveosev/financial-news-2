     May 4 (Bloomberg) --  Melco Crown Entertainment Ltd. (MPEL) , the
operator of casinos in Macau, hired five banks to help it borrow
$1.2 billion, according to a person familiar with the matter.  The five-year  term loan  will pay a top level all-in fee of
about 250 basis points to 275 basis points more than the London
interbank offered rate, the person said, asking not to be
identified as details are private.  The facility will be marketed to other lenders and is
expected to be signed in June, the person said. The five banks
are Australia & New Zealand Banking Group Ltd., Bank of America
Corp., Bank of China Ltd., Commerzbank AG and Deutsche Bank AG,
the person said.  Melco Crown tapped the so-called Dim Sum market for the
first time last month, selling 2.3 billion yuan ($354 million)
of two-year, 3.75 percent bonds, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Proceeds from that sale will be used in part to fund
acquisitions as well as to repay debt, the Hong Kong-based
company said in an April 26 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
