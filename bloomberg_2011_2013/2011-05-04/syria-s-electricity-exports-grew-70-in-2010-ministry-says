Syria  boosted power exports by 70
percent last year as domestic output increased, the Ministry of
Electricity said.  The country exported 1.05 billion kilowatt-hours, up from
615 million kilowatt-hours in 2009, according to a report from
the ministry. Electricity output rose by 7.2 percent last year
to 46.4 billion kilowatt-hours, it said.  Power demand in Syria rose 6.1 percent to 47.2 billion
kilowatt-hours in 2010, while imports grew 19 percent to 647
million kilowatt-hours, the ministry said in the May 2 report.
It didn’t explain why imports grew along with exports.  Syria bought and sold electricity with countries linked by
a regional  power grid , including Lebanon, Jordan,  Egypt ,  Libya ,
Iraq and  Turkey , as well as the Palestinian territories.  In the first three months of this year, Syria produced 12.9
billion kilowatt-hours and consumed 13.1 billion. It imported
118 million kilowatt-hours in the quarter, all of it from Egypt,
and exported 279 million hours. The ministry didn’t provide
comparable data for the same three-month period last year.  The report did not mention whether political turmoil in the
country since March 15 has affected electricity supplies. The
regime of President Bashar al-Assad has responded to
demonstrations by cracking down with increasing violence.  Syria passed an energy law on Nov. 14 allowing foreign and
private local investors to generate and distribute electricity.
The law has yet to come into effect, the state-run Baath
newspaper said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
