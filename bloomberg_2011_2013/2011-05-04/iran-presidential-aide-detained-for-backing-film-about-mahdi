An Iranian cleric and presidential
aide has been detained for backing a film about a key figure in
the Shiite Muslim faith, state media reported.  Abbas Amirifar, who heads President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s
cultural council, was summoned by a special clerical court and
arrested, the state-run  Fars  news agency reported May 2 without
giving details. Tehran Prosecutor-General Abbas Jafari-
Dolatabadi declined to elaborate when asked today about
accusations against Amirifar,  Fars  said.  Amirifar was arrested due to his cooperation in the making
and distribution of a film entitled “The Coming Is Near,” the
state-run  Iranian Students News Agency  reported, citing Jafari-
Dolatabadi. The film suggests that the Mahdi, the Messiah-figure
of Shiite Islam, is to appear soon.  The detention comes after reports of a rift between
Ahmadinejad and Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei -- the
country’s highest authority -- over the resignation of the
intelligence minister. Ahmadinejad, who had been absent from
official meetings for a week, denied the reports when he
returned to work on May 2, without explaining his absence.  Amirifar remains in detention and is under investigation,
 Rajanews.com , a pro-Ahmadinejad website, said yesterday citing
an unidentified judiciary official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
