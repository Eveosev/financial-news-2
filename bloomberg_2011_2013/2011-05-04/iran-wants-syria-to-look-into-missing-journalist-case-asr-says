Iran ’s foreign ministry wants 
Syria to look into the case of an Al Jazeera journalist who went
missing in Syria on April 29,  Asr-e-Iran  reported.  “I hope that it is not true, but if that is the case, then
we demand the government of Syria to look into this,” Iranian
foreign minister  Ali Akbar Salehi  said, while on a visit in
Qatar’s capital earlier this week, according to the Tehran-based
newspaper. Salehi’s comments came after he was asked what Iran
would undertake for Dorothy Parvaz to be freed, it said.  There has been no contact with Parvaz, 39, since she landed
six days ago in Damascus, the report said. Parvaz, an American,
Canadian and Iranian citizen, was on assignment to cover  Syria ’s
political upheavals, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
