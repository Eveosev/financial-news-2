Kuzbass Fuel Co., a Russian producer
of coal for power plants, said first-quarter sales fell 12
percent from the previous three months to 2.43 million metric
tons.  Year-on-year, volumes rose 26 percent because of increased
export sales, the Kemerovo, Siberia-based company said today in
an e-mailed statement.  Sales prices advanced 11 percent from the previous three
months to 1,155 rubles ($42.20) a ton, Kuzbass said. Prices grew
32 percent from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
