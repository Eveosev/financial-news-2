Norway ’s  Financial Supervisory
Authority  rejected a proposal by the country’s financial crisis
committee to introduce a levy on financial activities.  “The introduction of a tax on activities is undesirable,”
the Oslo-based regulator said today in a  statement  on its
website. “For Norwegian banks it will in the coming years be
more important to strengthen capital and liquidity than to
increase taxation,” the watchdog said in the report.  The financial crisis commission, set up in 2009 to examine
Norway’s markets after the financial crisis, in January
recommended a review of a tax on financial companies’ profits
and wage payments as well as a financial stability fee to be
levied on liabilities. Norway’s Finance Minister Sigbjoern Johnsen called the proposals “interesting” and said that he
would follow up.  The FSA also said that it supports the committee’s view
that a potential early introduction of international
requirements for liquidity and capital should be coordinated
between Nordic countries.  Norway coped with the financial crisis better than most
nations because of its oil and gas wealth. In 2009, the world’s
second-largest gas exporter and seventh-largest oil exporter set
up two funds with a total capital of 100 billion kroner ($19
billion) to support the banking and bond markets.  Norway’s mainland economy, which excludes oil, gas and
shipping, expanded 2.2 percent late year and is expected to grow
3.25 percent this year, according to the central bank.  To contact the reporters on this story:
