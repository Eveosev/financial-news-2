Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s Android operating system
extended its lead in the smartphone market to 35 percent of
global shipments in the first quarter, researcher Canalys said.  Android’s sales got a boost from popular phones made by
partners  HTC Corp. (2498) , including handsets for faster, fourth-
generation networks; Samsung Electronics Co.; Motorola Mobility
Holdings Inc.;  LG Electronics Inc. (066570) ; and  Sony Ericsson , according
to the Canalys report released today.  The Android system can be adopted by any device maker,
helping it pull ahead of more exclusive operating systems such
as  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s, which is only available on the iPhone. Android
accounted for 49 percent of the smartphone market in the U.S.,
the largest country for sales of the devices.  Apple shipped more than twice as many phones in the U.S.
this year than last after  Verizon Wireless  began selling the
iPhone 4 in February.  The Asia-Pacific region, which includes  China ,  South Korea 
and India, became the largest market for smartphones, almost
doubling the units sold there to 37.3 million. Worldwide
shipments grew 83 percent from a year earlier to 101 million.  To contact the reporters for this story:
