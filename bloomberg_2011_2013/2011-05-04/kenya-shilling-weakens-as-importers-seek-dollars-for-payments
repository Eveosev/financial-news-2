Kenya ’s shilling weakened for the
second day against the dollar as importers sought to buy more of
the U.S. currency to make payments.  The currency of East Africa’s biggest economy depreciated
as much as 0.2 percent to 83.67 per dollar and traded 0.1
percent down at 83.55 by 1:38 p.m. in the capital, Nairobi, from
a close of 83.50 yesterday.  “The shilling has slightly weakened as demand by importers
picks up and is expected to receive a boost from tea inflows to
trade within the 83.50 to 83.80 range in the coming days,”
Wilson Mutai, a dealer at Nairobi-based African Banking Corp.,
said in a phone interview today.  African tea prices were unchanged at an average of $2.61 a
kilogram at a weekly sale in  Mombasa , Kenya, compared with a
week earlier, Tea Brokers East Africa Ltd. said in an e-mailed
statement today. About 5.6 million kilogram of tea was sold at
the auction, it said. Kenya is the world’s biggest exporter of
black tea.  To contact the reporter on this story:
