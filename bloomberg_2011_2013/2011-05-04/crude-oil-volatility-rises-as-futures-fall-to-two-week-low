Oil options volatility increased as
the underlying futures fell to the lowest level in two weeks
following a U.S. Energy Department report that supplies surged,
and on signals that American economic growth is slowing.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
June, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a gauge
of options prices, was 28.3 percent as of 2 p.m. in  New York ,
down from 28.9 percent yesterday.  Crude for June delivery fell $1.81, or 1.6 percent, to
$109.24 a barrel, the lowest settlement price since April 19, on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange . Prices have advanced 32
percent in the past year.  The most active contracts in electronic trading were June
2011 $105 puts with 3,359 lots changing hands. They gained 23
cents to 82 cents a barrel. June $115 calls, the next-most
active option, fell 61 cents to 44 cents a barrel with 3,069
contracts trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of oil.  Nymex distributes real-time data for electronic trading and
releases information on floor trading, where the bulk of options
trading occurs, the next business day.  June $105 puts were the most active options traded in the
previous session, with 6,352 lots changing hands. They increased
29 cents to 59 cents a barrel. The next-most active option, June
