Russian President  Dmitry Medvedev 
approved a state policy to improve the rule of law and fight the
“legal nihilism” he says is slowing the country’s development.  “An insufficient level of legal culture and consciousness
and legal nihilism among Russian citizens pose a serious problem
in implementing the rule of law,” according to a  document 
posted on the Kremlin website today. This threatens property
rights and helps promote alcoholism, drug addiction,
prostitution and domestic violence, according to the policy.  Russia was ranked 154th among 178 countries in Berlin-based
Transparency International’s 2010 Corruption Perceptions Index,
tied with Tajikistan and  Kenya . Medvedev, a former lawyer, has
made fighting “legal nihilism” a main goal of his presidency,
advocating stronger legal institutions and greater respect for
the law. He has revamped legislation governing the police and
forced state officials to declare their incomes.  The new policy will focus on improving the application of
the law, stemming corruption and fighting nationalist and
religious extremism by providing training to state and law
enforcement officials and delivering awareness campaigns to
citizens through media and Internet.  The policy also aims to ensure that legal services are
transparent and accessible for citizens. The state will work
with civil society groups to improve legal literacy, according
to the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
