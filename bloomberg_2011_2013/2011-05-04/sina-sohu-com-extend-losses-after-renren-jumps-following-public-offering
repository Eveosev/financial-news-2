Sina Corp. and  Sohu.com Inc. (SOHU)  fell in
 New York  today, following the biggest drops in at least 19
months yesterday, on speculation that gains in the Chinese
Internet companies will slow and as investors added shares of
Renren Inc. to their portfolios.  Renren, China’s biggest social-networking website by page
views, jumped as much as 71 percent to $24 a share on its first
day of trading after selling 53.1 million American depositary
receipts yesterday at $14 each, the high end of the proposed
range. The shares climbed 36 percent to $19.05 at 3:24 p.m.  Sina, owner of the Twitter-like Weibo service in China,
slid 1.2 percent to $120.72 after losing 9.5 percent yesterday,
the most in more than two years. Sohu.com, the owner of  China ’s
fourth-most visited website, sank 0.6 percent to $94.30 after
declining 8.6 percent, the most in 19 months, a day earlier.  “These stocks have come so far so fast and there’s
willingness to frame it as a bubble, so you have people taking
profit,” said  Mike Hickey , an equity analyst at Janco Partners
Inc. in  Greenwood Village ,  Colorado . “Also Renren is out there,
so maybe there is some share shift into that position.”  Sina had advanced 78 percent this year through yesterday,
while Sohu.com had climbed 49 percent.  Baidu Inc., which owns the country’s most popular online
search engine, rose 0.4 percent today to $140.44 after a 5.8
percent losses in the prior two days. Baidu had gained 45
percent this year through yesterday, having reached a record
$152.37 last week.  NetEase.com (NTES)  Inc., the country’s third-biggest online games
Provider, increased 3.4 percent to $47.05 after sliding 8.5
percent yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
