General Motors Co. (GM)  may reduce
production of pickups after inventories of its trucks rose last
month,  Mark Reuss , president for  North America , said today.  “We’re going to do something about it, but we haven’t made
those calls yet,” Reuss said in a telephone interview. Buyers
shifted away from trucks last month, “but no one month makes a
trend, so we’ve got to see where this one holds.”  GM’s truck inventory rose to more than 275,000 at the end
of April, or about 111 days of supply,  Don Johnson , GM’s vice
president of U.S. sales, said yesterday on a conference call.
The Detroit-based automaker had about 264,000 trucks on dealer
lots a month earlier.  “With truck inventory up over 100 days, at some point they
probably will have to cut production,” Peter Nesvold, a New
York-based analyst for Jefferies & Co., said today in a
telephone interview.  GM rose 5 cents to $33.04 at 4:15 p.m. in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading. The shares last closed above $33,
GM’s initial public offering price, on Feb. 28. The IPO was in
November.  GM’s U.S. sales climbed 26 percent to 232,538 vehicles in
April from 183,997 a year earlier, the automaker said yesterday
in a statement. The results helped push the industrywide U.S.
auto sales rate in April to 13.2 million on a seasonally
adjusted annualized basis, the third straight month higher than
13 million.  Corvette Investment  Reuss spoke after GM announced it will add about 250 jobs
and invest $131 million to update an assembly plant in  Bowling
Green ,  Kentucky , that builds the Chevrolet Corvette. Bowling
Green will make the current version of the car for at least the
next two model years, including the 2012 version of the sports
car that begins sales this summer in the U.S. The investment
will be used to prepare the factory for the next-generation
Corvette, GM said.  GM said it has invested $3.4 billion and created or kept
more than 9,000 jobs in the U.S. since July 2009, when it
emerged from bankruptcy. The state of Kentucky offered $7.5
million in incentives as part of GM’s move, Reuss said.  GM said yesterday the Chevrolet Cruze compact car set a
record for sales since its introduction last year with 25,160
deliveries in April. The average U.S. price of regular unleaded
gasoline rose 37 percent in the past year to $3.98 a gallon
yesterday, according to AAA. The price peaked at $4.11 in July
2008.  GM reduced spending on incentives for U.S. customers in
April by 8.1 percent to an estimated $3,068 per vehicle,
according to Autodata Corp. The automaker is offering rebates of
as much as $4,505 for Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra
pickups, while offering no rebates on small cars like the
Chevrolet Cruze and Aveo, according to AIS Rebates, an  Ann
Arbor , Michigan-based provider of incentive data to dealers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
