Egypt  plans to sell 6 billion Egyptian
pounds ($1 billion) in treasury bills tomorrow after missing its
target in the previous three sales as yields rose on investor
concern about the country’s widening  budget deficit .  The Ministry of Finance aims to raise 3.5 billion pounds in
one-year notes and 2.5 billion pounds in 182-day securities,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg. At the last auction
on April 28, the government sold 4.37 billion pounds of the 6
billion pounds it sought as yields on the one-year notes climbed
to 12.82 percent, the highest since November 2008.  Yields on government treasury bills have been rising since
the start of a revolt that toppled President  Hosni Mubarak  in
February. The country’s worst political crisis in three decades
has slowed economic growth and may widen the budget deficit to 9
percent of gross domestic product in the fiscal year that ends
next month, compared with 8.1 percent in the previous year,
according to Finance Minister Samir Radwan.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 10-year dollar bond maturing in
April 2020 declined 1 basis point, or 0.01 percentage point, to
6.29 percent, the lowest level since April 15 at 4:28 p.m. in
Cairo, according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The pound fell
0.1 percent to 5.9508 per dollar.  The overnight  interbank rate  on the currency dropped to
8.77 percent on May 2, the lowest level since April 18,
according to data released by the central bank today. The
regulator’s overnight deposit rate is 8.25 percent, while the
overnight lending rate is 9.75 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
