Caribe Media Inc., which through units
publishes telephone directories in  Puerto Rico  and the Dominican
Republic, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.  The company listed assets and liabilities of as much as
$500 million in a filing today in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Wilmington, Delaware.  Caribe Media is indirectly owned by Local Insight Media
Holdings Inc., based in Englewood, Colorado, which filed for
Chapter 11 protection in November. Pat Nichols, a spokeswoman
for Local Insight Media, didn’t immediately return a call
seeking comment after regular business hours.  Standard & Poor’s  said in a March 1 report that San Juan,
Puerto Rico-based Caribe Media was facing declining demand for
its directories because of competition from online media for
small and midsize business advertisers and that the company’s
“weak” operating performance could make its debt structure
unsustainable.  The case is In re Caribe Media, 11-11387,  U.S. Bankruptcy
Court , Delaware (Wilmington).  To contact the reporter on this story:
