Fortescue Metals Group Ltd. (FMG) ,
 Australia ’s third-largest iron ore exporter, lost potential
access to Rio Tinto Group’s Robe River railroad after the
Federal Court overturned an order in its favor.  The court also rejected Fortescue’s appeal to get access to
Rio’s Hamersley line in the Pilbara, upholding the Australian
Competition Tribunal ruling that it wouldn’t be economically
feasible, according to an e-mailed Federal Court judgment.  “The decision isn’t unexpected,” Paul Downie, of FD, an
outside spokesman for Fortescue said by phone from Perth.
“Fortescue in the meantime has been building its own
infrastructure.”  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  and Rio have been fighting Fortescue’s
campaign to open their railroads to other producers, saying
sales and investments may be curbed.  Fortescue rose 0.8 percent to A$6.05 at 1:01 p.m. in Sydney
trading.  To contact the reporter on this story:
