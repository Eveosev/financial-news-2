A Turkish prosecutor will question
Kenan Evren, former president and the leader of the 1980
military coup, over his role in the deaths and torture of
suspected reactionaries and political prisoners, Star reported.  Prosecutor Murat Demir, placed in charge of a legal probe
into the army’s intervention, will visit Evren at his home
because he’s too old to travel to court for questioning. Demir
received thousands of requests from the general public to put
Evren on trial, the Istanbul-based newspaper said.  Constitutional changes approved last year in a nationwide
referendum allow for the prosecution of those responsible for
planning and executing the coup. Evren, who was chief of the
armed forces, became president in 1982 and served for seven
years.      Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
