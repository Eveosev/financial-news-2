Tokyo  Electric Power Co. said it aims
to lower radiation levels inside the No. 1 reactor building at
its crippled Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear station to 1
millisievert per hour or less from 10 millisieverts now.  The utility hopes that the levels will drop as soon as
tomorrow so that workers can install equipment to measure water
levels and pressure, Junichi Matsumoto, general manager at the
utility, told reporters in Tokyo today. They will also work on
installing a replacement cooling system, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
