Sub-Saharan  Africa ’s economy will
probably expand 5.1 percent this year, with the outlook for
growth “quite positive” as bumper harvests help to offset
rising food prices and investment recovers, a senior World Bank
official said.  “Africa has rebounded quite quickly after the global
economic crisis,” Shantayanan Devarajan, chief economist for
Africa at the World Bank, said in an interview in Cape Town
while attending the  World Economic Forum  on Africa.  While food and fuel price increases are “serious risks”
to the outlook, improved harvests in many countries are
providing a “cushion” and African governments have better
economic policies in place to mitigate the impact, Devarajan
said. Africa is also being partly sheltered by surging wheat
prices because of its reliance on rice, millet and other cereals
as staples, he said.  “The policies that African countries put in place at the
last crisis are beginning to pay off, so now farmers are getting
more of the increase in prices into their pockets thanks to
better infrastructure and better marketing,” Devarajan said.  The  World Bank ’s growth outlook for the region is lower
than the  International Monetary Fund , which estimated in last
month’s World Economic Outlook that sub-Saharan Africa will
probably expand 5.5 percent this year and 5.9 percent in 2012.  “Africa is indeed moving from vision to action,” South
African Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  said in an interview in
Cape Town today. “We see the current period as a new chapter
that is opening up, which is characterized by greater interest
in the African continent.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
