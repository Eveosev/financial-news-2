Stan Kroenke increased his stake in
Arsenal soccer club to 46.1 percent by exercising an option to
buy 10,025 shares.  The move was announced today in a Regulatory News Service
statement. He paid 11,750 pounds ($19,410) a share.  The American billionaire had an agreement to buy the 10,025
shares of the late board member Danny Fiszman, as well as
another holding controlled by Nina Bracewell-Smith. The two
purchases will eventually increase his stake to 63 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
