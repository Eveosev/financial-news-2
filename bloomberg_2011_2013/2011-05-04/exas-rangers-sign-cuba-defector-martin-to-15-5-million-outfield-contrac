The  Texas Rangers  signed outfielder
Leonys Martin to a five-year Major League Baseball contract that
may be the second-richest for a Cuban defector.  Martin’s deal is worth $15.5 million and includes a $5
million signing bonus, the Associated Press and  MLB.com  reported
without saying where they got the information. The Rangers
didn’t disclose financial terms in a news release.  Pitcher Aroldis Chapman received the richest major-league
contract for a Cuban defector, signing a six-year, $30.25
million deal with the  Cincinnati Reds  last year, AP said.  Martin, 23, defected to the U.S. after playing for Cuba’s
national team at the FISU World University Championships in
Tokyo. He’s working out at the Rangers’ complex in
Surprise,  Arizona , and will probably begin his season with the
franchise’s Double-A minor-league team.  Martin, a left-handed hitting center fielder, had a .314
batting average over five seasons in the Cuban league.  To contact the reporter on this story:
