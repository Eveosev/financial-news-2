The tornado outbreak that killed at
least 327 people in the Southeast last week may have been the
largest in U.S. history, with an estimated 305 twisters, the
 National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  said.  More than 600 tornadoes formed in all of April, compared
with the previous record of 267 set in 1974, the agency said in
a statement today. That makes April 2011 the most active month
ever, breaking the record of 542 tornadoes in May 2003.  “So far, there have been an estimated 881 tornadoes in
2011,” NOAA said. “The annual tornado record is 1,817, set in
2004. May is historically the most active month for tornadoes.”  Insured losses from the outbreak that lasted from April 25
to April 27 may be as much as $5 billion, according to
catastrophic risk modeler  Eqecat Inc.  in Oakland,  California . It
was the third-deadliest single outbreak, behind March 1925 with
747 deaths and March 1932 with 332, NOAA said.  The deadliest year in the U.S. was 1925 when 794 people
were killed, according to NOAA.  The  National Weather Service  has sent teams from 21 offices
in 14 states to survey the damage from last week’s outbreak. So
far, destruction from 178 storms has been surveyed and officials
have determined at least two of the storms were EF-5 twisters,
the strongest on the six-step Enhanced Fujita Scale.  EF-5 storms produce wind gusts of more than 200 miles per
hour (322 kilometers per hour), according to the  U.S. Storm
Prediction Center  in Norman,  Oklahoma .  Alabama  was hardest-hit, with at least 250 dead, according
to the state’s Emergency Management Agency.  To contact the reporters on this story:
