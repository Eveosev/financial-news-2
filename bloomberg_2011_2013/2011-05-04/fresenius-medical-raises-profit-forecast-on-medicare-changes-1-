Fresenius Medical Care AG, the world’s
biggest provider of  kidney dialysis , said it expects to be more
profitable this year as the U.S. Medicare program eliminates
fees for blood-cleansing facilities in connection with
reimbursement changes.  Fresenius Medical forecasts that net income in 2011 will
rise to a range of $1.07 billion and $1.09 billion from a former
estimate range of $1.04 billion to $1.06 billion, the company
said in a statement today. The company now expects revenue to
grow to more than $13 billion this year, compared with a
previous forecast of $12.8 billion to $13 billion.  The new Medicare reimbursement system, called the bundled
rate, was introduced last July. The rate is a fixed compensation
amount and is designed to reduce overuse of drugs that were
previously separately billable.  “FMC’s business will pick up particularly in the second
half of the year,” Olav Zilian, an analyst at Helvea SA in
Zurich, said in a report to clients dated April 27. Zilian has a
“neutral” recommendation on the shares.  The Bad Homburg, Germany-based company also said today net
income rose to $221 million from $211.1 million a year earlier.
That missed the $223.4 million average estimate of six analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg News. Sales increased 5 percent to $3
billion.  Separately,  Fresenius SE (FRE) , which owns 36 percent of
Fresenius Medical, reported that first-quarter net income
adjusted for the acquisition of APP Pharmaceuticals rose 43
percent to 170 million euros ($252 million).  Fresenius SE expects adjusted net income to rise 12 percent
to 16 percent this year excluding currency shifts, up from a
previous forecast of 8 percent to 12 percent, with revenue
rising 7 percent to 8 percent, compared with a previous forecast
of “over 7 percent.”  Fresenius SE, also based in Bad Homburg, runs private-
hospital operator Helios, the Vamed health-care services unit
and Fresenius Kabi, which sells infusion therapies and clinical
nutrition.  To contact the reporter on this story:
