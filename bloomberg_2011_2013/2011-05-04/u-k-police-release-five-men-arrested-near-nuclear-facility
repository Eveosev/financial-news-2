U.K. police released five men arrested
earlier this week near the Sellafield nuclear facility in
northwest  England .  They were released without charges being filed, Greater
Manchester Police said in a statement today. The men, all in
their twenties and from London, were arrested May 2 near the
Sellafield nuclear-processing plant in Cumbria.  They were transported to Manchester yesterday and were
questioned by anti-terrorism police today.  London police were
also involved in the investigation, with officers yesterday
searching four homes in east London linked to the arrests, the
Metropolitan Police said in an e-mailed statement.  The Sellafield nuclear site, formerly known as Windscale,
produced electricity for almost 50 years until shutting down in
2003, according to its  website . Activities at the site now
include decommissioning of the old power station, as well as
recycling fuel and processing nuclear waste, the site said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
