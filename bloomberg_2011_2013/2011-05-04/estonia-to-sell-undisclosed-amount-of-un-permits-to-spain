The Estonian government is scheduled
to approve the sale of United Nations-overseen carbon permits to
 Spain  in a deal valued at 45 million euros ($66.9 million).  The Estonian Cabinet will authorize Environment Minister
Keit Pentus to sign the agreement at its weekly session
tomorrow, government press officials said today in an e-mailed
statement. Keit Kasemets, strategy director at the state
chancellery in Tallinn, confirmed the value of the deal in an e-
mailed response to Bloomberg questions. The number of permits
sold to Spain is confidential, he said.  Estonia  has sold more than 60 percent of a surplus
amounting to 85 million metric tons of Assigned Amount Units,
known as AAUs, since raising more than 300 million euros ($446
million), Kasemets said in March after the country approved
three deals with Japan’s  Mitsubishi Corp. (8058)  and Sumitomo Mitsui
Banking Corp.  Sales of emission permits last year helped Estonia to
achieve a budget surplus of 0.1 percent of gross domestic
product, against the government’s forecast of a deficit of 1.3
percent.  Estonia was involved in 11 of 21 AAU transactions globally
last year, Point Carbon reported on Jan. 12. The  Czech Republic 
has been the biggest seller of credits since 2008, Point Carbon
said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
