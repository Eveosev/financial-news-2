The  Tampa Bay  Lightning pushed the
top-seeded  Washington Capitals  to the brink of elimination and
the  Vancouver Canucks  beat the  Nashville Predators  in overtime
to go up 2-1 in their National Hockey League playoff series.  The Lightning beat the Capitals 4-3 last night to lead
their best-of-seven series by three games to none, while the
Canucks won 3-2.  Steven Stamkos and Ryan Malone scored 24 seconds apart in
the third period to give the Lightning the win over the Capitals
at St. Pete Times Forum in Tampa.  Sean Bergenheim put Tampa ahead in the first period. Mike Knuble tied it 59 seconds into the second period and John Carlson made it 2-1 to the Capitals seven minutes later. Vincent Lecavalier tied it at 2-2 before  Alex Ovechkin  put the Capitals
ahead again.  Tampa Bay can eliminate the Capitals with a home win in
Game 4 tonight. Also tonight, the Boston Bruins and San Jose
Sharks can take 3-0 series leads against the Philadelphia Flyers
and Detroit Red Wings, respectively.  At Bridgestone Arena in Nashville, Ryan Kesler scored his
second goal of the game on a power play 10:45 into overtime to
secure the win for the Canucks.  David Legwand gave the Predators a 1-0 lead in the first
period and Kesler tied it in the second period. Christopher Higgins put the Canucks 2-1 ahead in the third and Joel Ward
tied it at 2-2 to force overtime.  Nashville hosts Game 4 tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
