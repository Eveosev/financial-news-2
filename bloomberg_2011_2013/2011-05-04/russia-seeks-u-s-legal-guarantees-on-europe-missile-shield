Russia told NATO at a meeting today
that it wants “legal guarantees” the U.S. and its allies won’t
use their planned missile shield in  Europe  to guard against the
Russian nuclear arsenal, RIA-Novosti reported.  Russia’s strategic nuclear forces should be off-limits for
the system, the state-run news service cited Russian Chief of
Staff General Nikolai Makarov as saying in Brussels.  Russia’s Foreign Ministry yesterday expressed concern about
a May 3 agreement between the U.S. and  Romania  to station
interceptor missiles at a former Romanian air force base. It
said the Obama administration was pursuing plans to set up its
anti-missile system in Europe without accepting an offer of
Russian participation.  Russian leaders complain that the shield, which the U.S.
says is needed to guard against so-called rogue states such as
 Iran , will blunt their country’s nuclear capability. They have
warned of a new arms race within the next decade unless they can
cooperate with the U.S. and its allies on missile defense.  To contact the reporter on this story:
