Peter Solmssen,  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s main
board director with responsibility for the Americas, said the
U.S. is “a market with lots of opportunity because of the
technologies that are developed here,” the Financial Times
reported, citing an interview.  The German company may today report a recovery in U.S.
sales and new orders as a result of gains in the U.S.
manufacturing industry, the FT reported.  Siemens is currently seeking a site in the U.S. for a new
‘sustainability centre’ to serve as an office and showcase for
its planned new division offering products and services for
cities, the FT also reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
