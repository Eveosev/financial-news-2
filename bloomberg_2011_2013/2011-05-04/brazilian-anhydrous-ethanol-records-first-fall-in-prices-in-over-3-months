Prices for Brazilian anhydrous ethanol
that’s mixed 25 percent with gasoline have fallen for the first
time in over three months as recently activated mills cash in on
its high price.  Average prices at mills in  Sao Paulo  state fell by 12.6
percent to 2.38 reais ($1.50) a liter last week, Piracicaba-
based research institute  Centro de Estudos Avancados em Economia
Aplicada , known as Cepea, said in an e-mailed statement today.
They climbed 122 percent over the previous 13 weeks, according
to the statement.  Ethanol prices usually rise at the beginning of the year as
mills in the south shut down for the rainy season, according to
Arnaldo Luiz Correa, an analyst at Archer Consulting in Sao
Paulo.  At the end of last month, about 200 of the 335 mills in
 Brazil ’s Center-South had started crushing sugar cane, Sao
Paulo-based cane industry association Uniao da Industria de
Cana-de-Acucar said in a  statement .  Companies have been prioritizing the production of
anhydrous ethanol which was remunerating 24 percent more than
sugar in April, Cepea said.  Many Brazilian cane mills can either produce sugar or
ethanol.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
