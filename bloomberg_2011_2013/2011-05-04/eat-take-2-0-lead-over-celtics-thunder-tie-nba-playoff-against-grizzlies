LeBron James, Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh combined to score 80 points as the  Miami Heat  beat the
 Boston Celtics  for the second straight game, while the Oklahoma
City Thunder tied their National Basketball Association series
against the Memphis Grizzlies.  James scored 35 points, Wade added 28 and Bosh contributed
17 as the Heat beat the Celtics 102-91 to take a 2-0 lead in
games in their Eastern Conference second-round series.  “Feel good about it,” James told reporters at
AmericanAirlines Arena in Miami. “Series is far, far, far, far
away from over. It’s really just beginning for us.”  The Heat went on a 14-0 fourth-quarter scoring run to pull
away from the Celtics after Paul Pierce tied the game at 80-80.
The home team out-scored  Boston  22-11 over the last seven
minutes.  The best-of-seven series moves to Boston for the next two
games, on May 7 and 9.  At Oklahoma City Arena, Kevin Durant had 26 points, Russell Westbrook scored 24 and James Harden added 21 as the Thunder
beat the Grizzlies 111-102 to avenge a Game 1 home loss and tie
the series at 1-1.  Mike Conley was the high scorer with 24 points for the
Grizzlies, who host Game 3 on May 7.  The top-seeded  Chicago Bulls  go into tonight’s game against
the Atlanta Hawks looking to tie the series at a game apiece,
while the two-time defending NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers
will seek to avoid losing the opening two games of their series
at home against the  Dallas Mavericks .  To contact the reporter on this story:
