little changed after yesterday falling the most in a week.  Baseload power for 2012 fell 4 cents, or 0.1 percent, to
59.30 euros ($88.11), according to broker data compiled by
Bloomberg as of 9:34 p.m. Berlin time. It yesterday slid 0.9
percent, the most since April 26. Baseload is delivered around
the clock.  The benchmark contract in Europe’s biggest market last
month climbed to its highest price since June 2009 after  Germany 
shut reactors for a safety review after the nuclear disaster in
 Japan . The contract closed as high as 60.55 euros on April 4.  Bloomberg tracks power prices from brokers including  GFI
