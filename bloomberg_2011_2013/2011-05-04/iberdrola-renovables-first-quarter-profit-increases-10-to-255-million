Iberdrola Renovables SA (IBR) , the biggest
producer of clean energy, said first-quarter profit rose to
171.9 million euros ($255 million), surpassing analysts’
expectations, as generating capacity increased.  Net income gained 10 percent from a year earlier as the
Valencia, Spain-based company trimmed the cost of operating its
wind energy plants by 1.5 percent. Revenue climbed 2.1 percent
to 648.8 million euros, Renovables said today in a regulatory
filing. Nine analysts surveyed by Bloomberg estimated a median
profit of 161 million euros.  Renovables’s parent  Iberdrola SA (IBE) , which owns 80 percent of
the company, offered in March to buy out minority investors in
the wind-energy producer for 2.5 billion euros. Renovable’s
shares have dropped almost 42 percent since its 2007 initial
public offering.  Clean-power generators have lost value after Spain rewrote
subsidy laws for existing plants and U.S. plants that burn
fossil fuels were boosted by increased supplies of natural gas
from shale.  Renovables in March slashed its planned investments in new
capacity globally by more than one-third through 2012 to
preserve its profit margins.  Renovables power production rose 12 percent from the year
earlier period to 7,636 gigawatt hours as the company’s
generating capacity increased by 250 megawatts to 12.8
gigawatts. The company has a further 1 gigawatt of generators
under construction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
