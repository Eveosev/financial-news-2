Ethanol futures were little changed in
 Chicago  as corn advanced while crude oil and gasoline declined
after a report showed lower demand.  The biofuel was steady as corn, its primary feedstock in
the U.S., gained on concern wet weather in the grain-abundant
Midwest will postpone planting and as fuels dipped after a
government report showed gasoline demand slid 2.2 percent last
week to 8.94 million barrels a day.  “Corn bounced around early in the session before climbing
for some moderate gains on the day, sending ethanol prices up a
few cents as well,” SCB & Associates Inc. wrote in an e-mail
today.  Denatured ethanol for May delivery rose 0.1 cent to $2.621
a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. The price ranged from
$2.595 to $2.628. Prices are 64 percent higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading ethanol was unchanged in  New York  at
$2.73 a gallon, in Chicago at $2.62 and in the U.S. Gulf and
West Coast at $2.755 a gallon, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Corn futures for July delivery rose 5.75 cents, or 0.8
percent, to close at $7.295 a bushel in Chicago.  Crude oil for June delivery fell $1.81, or 1.6 percent, to
$109.24 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the lowest
settlement since April 19. Gasoline for June delivery decreased
0.69 cent to settle at $3.3225 a gallon.  Average ethanol mills in Iowa are losing 2 cents on every
gallon produced, while plants in  Illinois  are losing 3 cents on
a spot basis, according to Ag Trader Talk, an online grains
information service in Clive,  Iowa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
