The  International Atomic Energy Agency 
should have increased oversight on civil nuclear facilities and
the Group of Eight nations will make proposals to ramp up the
agencyâ€™s power, French Environment Minister Nathalie Kosciusko-
Morizet said today.  G-8 countries may make proposals to the IAEA in June after
their Energy and Environment ministers meet in Paris, Kosciusko-
Morizet told lawmakers at a parliamentary hearing in Paris
today. She said ministers as well as nuclear safety watchdogs of
the countries will gather and make proposals subsequently.  The  Wien-based United Nations nuclear watchdog  holds a
meeting in June to evaluate the consequences of the Fukushima,
 Japan , nuclear plant incident and measures to increase nuclear
installations safety.  To contact the reporter on this story:
