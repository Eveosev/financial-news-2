U.K. bonds fell after demand for
government debt waned at an auction and  Standard & Poor’s  said
surging inflation will mean the Bank of England is “almost
certain” to tighten monetary policy in the next three months.  The drop lifted 10-year yields from near a four-month low.
Investors bid for 1.25 times the amount of 5 percent 2025 bonds
offered today, compared with 1.57 at the previous sale of the
securities on March 17, 2009, Debt Management Office data shows.
The ratio is also down from 1.72 at a sale of bonds due 2021 on
April 5. The pound was little changed against the euro after
earlier reaching the lowest level in more than a year.  “It’s the auction that’s leading gilts lower,” said Adam McCormack, head of gilt sales at Barclays Plc in London. “The
cover was a lot lower than you’d expect. The market has had a
good rally, and investor appetite at these lower yields was only
sufficient to just take up the auction.”  U.K. 10-year yields rose one basis point to 3.43 percent as
of 1:42 p.m. in London. They earlier dropped to 3.415 percent,
less than half a basis point from yesterday’s low of 3.411
percent, which was the least since Jan. 4. The yield on the two-
year note due March 2013 was one basis point higher at 1.03
percent.  Gilts have rallied this year, lowering 10-year yields by
about eight basis points, on speculation the  Bank of England 
will keep its benchmark interest rate at a record low to help
boost economic growth. Policy makers are expected to keep the
key rate at 0.5 percent when they announce their next decision
tomorrow, according to a Bloomberg survey of economists.  Inflation Outlook  S&P dissented from that view today, saying it expects rates
to rise within three months as inflation resumes its surge. U.K.
inflation unexpectedly eased to 4 percent in March after five
months of acceleration brought the rate to 4.4 percent in
February. That level was the highest in more than two years and
more than twice the central bank’s 2 percent limit.  “A first rate hike seems almost certain in the coming
three months,” S&P’s chief economist for  Europe , Jean-Michel Six, said in today’s report. “After the March blip, we think
inflation is likely to take off once again, to peak around 5
percent in the third quarter.”  Short-sterling futures fell, lifting the implied yield on
the contract expiring March 2012 by four basis points to 1.29
percent, as investors added to bets for interest-rate increases
next year.  House Prices Fall  The pound depreciated 0.3 percent to 89.77 pence per euro,
its weakest level since March 29, 2010. After S&P’s statement,
it recovered to trade at 90.19 pence. Sterling climbed 0.4
percent to $1.6547.  The pound is still near the weakest since at least 1975
against a basket of currencies. A measure of sterling against
its nine most traded peers earlier fell to 60.70 as measured by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes. That’s near the
60.63 level reached yesterday, which was the lowest since
records began in 1975.  Economic data released today showed U.K. house prices fell
in April for the first month in three, while construction growth
slowed and mortgage approvals were stagnant.  The average cost of a British home dropped 0.2 percent from
March to 165,609 pounds ($273,000),  Nationwide Building Society 
said, compared with a gain of 0.1 percent forecast in a
Bloomberg survey of 14 economists. That’s the first decrease
since January.  A gauge of building activity based on a survey of
purchasing managers fell to 53.3 in April, from 56.4 the
previous month, Markit Economics Ltd. and the  Chartered
Institute of Purchasing and Supply  said. That was below the 55.9
estimate in a Bloomberg survey and the lowest since December.  U.K. mortgage approvals were little changed in March as a
squeeze on incomes weighed on the housing market. Lenders
granted 47,557 home loans, up from a revised 46,708 in February,
the Bank of England said. The median forecast of 11 economists
in a Bloomberg survey was for an increase to 48,000 from an
initially reported 47,000. Net mortgage lending rose 400 million
pounds in March, half the average over the previous six months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
