Tanzania’s state-run  National Social
Security Fund  expects its assets to grow 11.8 percent in the
financial year through June 2012, on increased contributions
from members.  The fund will expand to 807.5 billion shillings ($534.7
million), according to its corporate plan handed to Bloomberg
today in  Dar es Salaam . The plan will be presented to the
 finance ministry  before July.  The company may diversify its investment portfolio into
energy generation starting in the next financial year, John
Msemo, projects manager at the fund, said on March 24. The fund
is the biggest in the country with about 450,000 contributors.
Other state-run investors include the Public Service Pension
Fund with 198,000 contributors and the Parastatal Pension Fund
with 78,000.  “It is proposed to seek alternative sources of financing
to facilitate investment in the energy and infrastructure
sectors or investing by joint venture,” the corporate plan
says. “Given the current financial position, it’s worth noting
that the huge resources required to finance these type of
projects cannot be raised from within the Fund’s own sources.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
