Terex Corp. (TEX) ’s offer for  Demag Cranes
AG (D9C)  that values the German maker of harbor cranes at about at
883.9 million euros ($1.27 billion) is “completely inadequate”
and doesn’t reflect Demag’s value, its largest shareholder said.  Terex proposed on May 2 to pay 41.75 euros for each share
of Dusseldorf-based Demag. That offer is “in no way reflects
the value potential of the company,” Lars Foerberg, a founding
partner of Cevian Capital, said by e-mail today. Stockholm-based
Cevian owns about 10 percent of Demag Cranes.  Cevian, an activist fund that seeks to push for change at
companies where it owns a stake, is putting pressure on Terex to
increase its offer, with Demag’s stock trading above the bid
since it was announced. Terex is the second suitor to pursue
Demag, which rebuffed an approach in February by  Konecranes Oyj. (KCR1V)   Demag fell as much as 30 cents, or 0.7 percent, to 46
euros, and traded at 46.15 euros at 12:02 p.m.  A takeover would be the material-handling industry’s
largest in at least a decade. Konecranes still targets growth
through purchases of manufacturers and service companies,
spokesman Mikael Wegmuller said on May 4, declining to comment
on Demag.  Cevian bought the stake in Demag last year. Jens Tischendorf, a partner at Cevian, joined Demag’s supervisory
board Oct. 22. Cevian and U.K. hedge funds control at least 30
percent of Demag’s shares, according to an estimate of WestLB
analyst Achim Henke.  To contact the reporter on this story:
