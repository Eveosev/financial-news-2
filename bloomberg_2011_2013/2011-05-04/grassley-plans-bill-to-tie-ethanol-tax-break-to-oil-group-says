U.S. Senator  Charles Grassley , an Iowa
Republican, plans to introduce legislation that would tie an
ethanol tax break to the price of oil, said Matt Hartwig, a
spokesman for the  Renewable Fuels Association  in Washington.  The measure, which Grassley may offer today, would convert
the 45-cent credit into a “variable tax credit that would
adjust based on the price of oil,” Hartwig said in an e-mail.  A group of Democratic and Republican senators yesterday
introduced legislation to repeal the credit, which is estimated
to cost $6 billion a year, and a tariff on ethanol imports.  The credit, which helps the corn ethanol industry, is set
to expire this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
