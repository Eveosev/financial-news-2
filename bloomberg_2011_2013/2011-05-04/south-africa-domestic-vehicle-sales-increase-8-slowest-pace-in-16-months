South African domestic vehicle sales
rose the least in 16 months in April, increasing 8 percent from
the same month last year, an industry group said.  Sales gained to 38,566, the National Association of
Automobile Manufacturers of  South Africa  said in an e-mailed
statement today. Average growth in the first quarter was 19
percent, it said.  Carmakers have benefited from interest-rate cuts that
brought the benchmark to a 30-year low of 5.5 percent as the
 Reserve Bank  sought to boost  consumer spending  in Africa’s
biggest economy. Lower rates have spurred sales for 16 months as
they “improved the financial position of consumers and
businesses and reduced the debt servicing costs of households
and companies,” the association said.  Passenger car sales gained 12 percent from a year ago to
26,347 in April, while purchases of light commercial vehicles,
such as pick-up trucks and minivans, decreased 2.5 percent to
10,294, the association said.  “The industry’s sales performance had been affected by the
high number and configuration of public holidays during April,
2011,” the association said.  Exports surged an annual 13 percent to 19,826 in April. The
association forecasts exports will reach 300,000 this year.  The central bank may raise  interest rates  in the second
half of the year as rising oil and food prices push up
inflation. A rate increase would moderate vehicle sales, even as
they are buoyed by the prospects of higher economic growth in
the global economy, the association said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
