Australian Prime Minister  Julia Gillard ’s plan to put a price on carbon by introducing laws
aimed at curbing emissions is opposed by most voters, according
to a Newspoll opinion survey.  The  survey  shows that about 60 percent of voters are
against the proposal, while 30 percent are in favor, according
to the poll of 1,201 people conducted between April 29 and May 1
for the Australian newspaper. Emissions should be priced at
between A$20 and A$30 a metric ton, rising at 4 percent a year,
climate change adviser,  Ross Garnaut , said last month.  Gillard wants to set a carbon price for  Australia , the
world’s biggest coal exporter, starting in July 2012 before a
trading system that may begin as early as 2015. The nation has
set a target of generating 20 percent of its power from
renewable sources including wind and solar by 2020.  To contact the reporter on this story:
