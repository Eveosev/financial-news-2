AOL Inc. (AOL) , the Web company that bought
the Huffington Post in March, said first-quarter profit fell 86
percent as declining subscription sales overshadowed the first
gain in display advertising in more than three years.  Net income dropped to $4.7 million, or 4 cents a share,
from $34.7 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. Sales slid 17
percent to $551.4 million, New York-based AOL said today in a
statement, topping the $533.4 million average of estimates
compiled by Bloomberg.  Chief Executive Officer  Tim Armstrong  is building a Web-
content business based on advertising revenue as customers
abandon AOL’s dial-up Internet-access service for broadband
rivals. Armstrong said that the growth in display ads was an
“important milestone,” marking the first gain since the fourth
quarter of 2007.  “To show display growth and meaningful growth is a
significant change for us as a business,” Armstrong said in an
interview.  The company bought the  Huffington Post  in March for $315
million and said it would eliminate as many as 900 jobs as it
integrates the news website and restructures its operations.
AOL plans to “take a pause from acquisitions,” Armstrong said.
“We’ll be back in the M&A market but for now we are basically
focused on integration,” he said.  Reorganization Costs  AOL, spun off from  Time Warner Inc. (TWX)  in 2009, fell 27 cents,
or 1.3 percent, to $20.13 at 4 p.m. in New York Stock Exchange
trading. The shares have lost 15 percent this year.  Global display advertising grew 4 percent to $130.5
million, as U.S. display ads increased 11 percent to $122
million.  Total ad revenue fell 11 percent to $313.7 million.
Internet-subscription sales declined 24 percent to $215.4
million.  The net income included $27.8 million in costs related to
the Huffington Post acquisition and operations in  India .
Excluding those costs and other items, earnings were 22 cents
per share.  Analysts had predicted adjusted earnings of 26 cents, the
average of 10 estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  (The company held a conference call at 8 a.m. New York time
