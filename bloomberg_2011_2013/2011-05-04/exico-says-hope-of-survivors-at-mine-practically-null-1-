Mexican rescuers are seeking to
recover the bodies of workers still trapped in a  coal mine  after
an explosion yesterday, as the hope of finding anyone alive
dwindles, Labor Minister Javier Lozano said.  Five bodies have been recovered from the mine in the
northern state of Coahuila, while nine other workers are still
missing, Lozano said in an interview with Mexico City-based
Radio Formula today. One survivor was pulled out and taken to a
hospital yesterday, he said.  "The hope of finding survivors is practically null," Lozano
said.  The blast in a mining complex operated by Compania Minera
Binsa in the municipality of Sabinas was triggered by methane
gas. The section of the mine where the explosion occurred
started operating three weeks ago without government licenses
and proper registration for its entire workforce, Lozano said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
