percent today, while Ireland’s ISEQ Index slipped 1.1 percent.  Investors “had their fingers firmly on the selling

energy stocks were sold off.”  The FTSE 100 advanced 2.7 percent in April, its biggest

earnings that topped analyst estimates and the U.S. Federal
Reserve maintained its pledge to keep interest rates low to
safeguard the recovery for the world’s largest economy.  Stocks extended losses today after an April gauge of

after the U.K. bank that makes three-quarters of its profit in
Asia cut jobs to control costs in the first quarter as
competition raised pressure on profitability.  Next rallied 4.4 percent to 2,319 pence after the U.K.’s
