Los Angeles Clippers  forward Blake Griffin will be named the  National Basketball Association ’s
Rookie of the Year, the  Associated Press  reported, citing a
person familiar with today’s decision.  Griffin, the No. 1 draft pick out of the University of
 Oklahoma  in 2009, led the Clippers with an average 22.5 points
and 12.1 rebounds while playing in all 82 games this season. He
missed the previous season with a broken kneecap.  The 22-year-old forward became the first rookie All-Star in
eight years when he was named to the West team. He was the
league’s fourth-leading rebounder and 12th-leading scorer.  The Clippers (32-50) missed this year’s playoffs for the
13th time in 14 seasons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
