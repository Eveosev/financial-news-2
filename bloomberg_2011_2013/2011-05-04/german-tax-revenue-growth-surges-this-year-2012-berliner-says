Germany  can look forward to a higher
growth in tax revenue than expected this year and in 2012, the
 Berliner Zeitung  reported, citing estimates by an economic
institute that tally with the government’s own expectations.  This year, total tax receipts may increase by 14 billion
euros ($21 billion) more than the 537 billion euros pegged by
the government’s own tax panel in November, the newspaper cited
the IMK economic institute as saying, in a preview of an article
to be published today. In 2012, revenue will grow 17 billion
euros more than expected, it said.  The government’s independent tax panel will present new tax
revenue forecasts on May 12.  To contact the reporter on this story:
