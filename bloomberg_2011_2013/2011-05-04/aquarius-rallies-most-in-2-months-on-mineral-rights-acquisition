Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP) , the world’s
fourth-largest producer of the metal, rallied the most in more
than two months after saying it acquired the mining rights on
farms adjacent to its Everest Mine in  South Africa .  The stock jumped 3.28 rand, or 8.9 percent, to 40 rand, the
most since Feb. 24.  Aquarius will expand its resources by almost a quarter with
the 1.2 billion-rand ($180.9 million) purchase from  Northam
Platinum Ltd. (NHM)  of rights to platinum group metal and associated
base-metal minerals at Booysendal South, the London-based
company said today in a statement. The deposits are located in
the Bushveld complex in the north of the country, which contains
the world’s richest platinum reserves.  To contact the reporter on this story:
