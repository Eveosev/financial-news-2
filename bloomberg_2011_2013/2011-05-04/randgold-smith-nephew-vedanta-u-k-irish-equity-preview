U.K. stocks declined for a second day
as  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY)  posted a loss and earnings from
 Schroders Plc (SDR)  disappointed investors, overshadowing better-than-
estimated revenue at  Diageo Plc. (DGE)   Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, tumbled 8
percent. Schroders sank 9.2 percent as profit before tax missed
some analysts’ estimates. Diageo, the world’s largest distiller,

more than two weeks. The FTSE All-Share Index and Ireland’s ISEQ
Index dropped 1 percent and 0.6 percent, respectively.  “The quality of underlying profits at Lloyds Banking Group
leaves much to be desired,” said  Howard Wheeldon , a London-
based strategist at BGC Partners LP. The bank is “far more
dependent than its peers on the specific U.K. banking arena,
meaning that it does not have large-scale activities overseas or
a massive investment-banking scenario to hold things up.”  The FTSE 100 advanced 2.7 percent in April, its biggest
monthly rally this year, as companies across  Europe  posted
earnings that topped analyst estimates and the U.S. Federal

record low as signs the recovery is losing momentum kept a
majority of policy makers focused on stimulating growth during
the government’s fiscal squeeze.  The nine-member Monetary Policy Committee, led by Governor
 Mervyn King , held the key rate at 0.5 percent, as forecast by
all 43 economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The bank also left
its bond-purchase program at 200 billion pounds ($330 billion),
as forecast by 29 economists in a separate poll.  Lloyds tumbled 8 percent to 53.38 pence, a 10-month low.
The bank swung into loss in the first quarter after setting
aside 3.2 billion pounds to cover potential claims of mis-
selling payment protection insurance.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  dropped 2.9 percent to
40.48 pence.  Schroders Slips  Schroders declined 9.2 percent to 1,700 pence after profit
before tax missed some analysts’ estimates. Barclays Plc

today. That outpaced the median estimate of eight analysts for
growth of 3.3 percent and the 4 percent growth reported in the
first half.  Smith & Nephew Plc (SN/)  gained 3 percent to 680 pence. The
