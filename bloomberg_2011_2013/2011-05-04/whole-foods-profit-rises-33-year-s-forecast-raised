Whole Foods Market Inc. (WFMI) , the largest
U.S. natural-goods grocer, boosted its full-year earnings
projection after reporting a 33 percent gain in second-quarter
profit. The shares advanced.  Whole Foods will earn as much as $1.90 a share in 2011, the
Austin, Texas-based company said today in a statement.
Previously, the grocer forecast profit of as much as $1.80.  Sales in the three months ended April 10 climbed 12 percent
to $2.35 billion. Whole Foods has sought to lure nutrition-
conscious customers away from more traditional supermarkets in
the U.S. with its “Health Starts Here” program.  “We think that health and wellness is a very big idea,”
Co-Chief Executive Officer Walter Robb said in a telephone
interview. Whole Foods has been “gaining share” from other
grocery stores and retailers, he said.  Whole Foods rose as much as $5.03, or 8.4 percent, to
$64.77 in extended trading. The shares fell 3 cents to $59.74 at
4 p.m.  New York  time in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, for an 18
percent gain this year.  “A lot of the revenue growth has been coming primarily
from increased traffic,” said Ajay Jain, an analyst at Hapoalim
Securities USA Inc. in New York with a “neutral” rating on the
shares. “They did make an effort to increase their value
offerings and that’s resonating with consumers.”  Net income climbed to $89.9 million, or 51 cents a share,
from $67.5 million, or 39 cents, a year earlier, the company
said. Excluding some items, analysts had predicted 46 cents a
share, the average of 21 estimates in a Bloomberg survey.  Whole Foods, founded more than 30 years ago, operates more
than 300 stores in the U.S., Canada and the U.K.  To contact the reporter on this story:
