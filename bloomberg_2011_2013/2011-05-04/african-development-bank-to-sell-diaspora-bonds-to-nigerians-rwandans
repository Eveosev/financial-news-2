The  African Development Bank  may sell
international bonds on behalf of Nigeria and Rwanda and market
them to people born in those nations that live overseas, said
Mthuli Ncube, the bank’s chief economist and vice president.  The so-called diaspora bonds will be partly guaranteed by
the Tunis-based lender, Ncube said in an interview in  Cape Town 
today. Nigeria has the potential to sell as much as $2 billion
of the bonds, according to the ADB’s research, he added.  “We are at the early phases of investigating a diaspora
bond for these countries,” Ncube said. “These will be used as
pilots.”  The ADB hopes to sell the bonds within 12 months, and will
guarantee part of the debt, using its investment-grade credit
ratings to add “credibility,” Ncube said. The lender is rated
Aaa by Moody’s Investor Service, AAA by Standard & Poor’s and
AAA by Fitch, the highest investment grade in each case.  Companies and governments in sub-Saharan  Africa  could raise
as much as $10 billion a year by issuing diaspora bonds backed
by remittance flows, the  World Bank  and ADB said in a  report  on
its website on March 30.  Remittances to Africa grew fourfold between 1990 and 2010,
to $40 billion last year, according to World Bank and ADB data.
India and  Israel  are among countries that have already issued
such bonds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
