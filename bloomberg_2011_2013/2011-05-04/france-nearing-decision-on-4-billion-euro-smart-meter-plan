France  will decide by the end of
September whether to proceed with a 4 billion-euro ($6 billion)
plan to install “smart” power meters in 35 million homes
across the country, Industry Minister Eric Besson said today.  A pilot project called “Linky” in which 250,000 devices
were tested in homes near the French cities of Lyon and Tours
was successful, Besson said at a press conference in Paris. The
meters can be monitored remotely and provide real-time
information about power use to promote more efficiency, he said.  Besson declined to say how the meters would be paid for,
adding that the government will limit as much as possible any
increases in energy costs to consumers.  “Financing is being studied and will be decided in the
coming weeks,” said Michelle Bellon, president of Electricite
de France SA’s ERDF distribution unit. Half of the total cost of
the national plan is for equipment and the rest is needed for
installation, she said.  France is aiming to meet European Union requirements for
the installation of smart meters in homes by 2020, Besson said.
The country would publish tenders for the meters, which could be
installed in homes at a rate of about 6 million a year, she
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
