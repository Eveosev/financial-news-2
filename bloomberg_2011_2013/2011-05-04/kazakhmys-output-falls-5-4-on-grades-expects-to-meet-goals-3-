Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) ,  Kazakhstan ’s biggest
copper company, reported a 5.4 percent decline in first-quarter
output on lower ore grades while retaining full-year estimates.  The company, based in London, produced 74,200 metric tons
of copper cathode, a finished form of the metal, compared with
78,400 tons a year earlier, Kazakhmys said in a statement today.
Output of copper in concentrate slid 13 percent to 72,000 tons
as average grades fell to 0.99 percent from 1.15 percent.  Kazakhmys reported “solid first-quarter production,” Amos Fletcher, an analyst at JPMorgan Cazenove, wrote in a note. The
company fell 2 percent to 1,305 pence by the 4:30 p.m. close in
London, valuing it at 6.98 billion pounds ($11.5 billion).  Kazakhmys, which expects to produce 300,000 tons of copper
this year, is developing the Bozshakol and Aktogay mines to lift
annual output by two-thirds in 2015 and benefit from increasing
demand and prices for the metal. The company sold its copper at
an average price of $9,823 a ton in the first quarter, compared
with $7,037 a year earlier, according to the statement.  “We have had a solid start to the year with copper cathode
production on track to meet our full-year target,” Chief
Executive Officer Oleg Novachuk said in the statement.  Production of zinc in concentrate, an intermediate product
shipped to refineries, fell 8.4 percent to 36,200 tons on weaker
grades and ore production, according to the statement.  Share Re-rating  Net debt shrank to $295 million by the end of March from
$350 million at the end of December on rising copper prices.  Kazakhmys plans to sell a stake of about 2 percent through
a Hong Kong listing and is studying options for its 26 percent
holding in Eurasian Natural Resources Corp. including swapping
the shares for other assets, Novachuk said on March 3.  “We see the potential sale of the ENRC stake and the Hong
Kong listing over the course of 2011 as likely to assist in
delivering a re-rating” of Kazakhmys shares, Fletcher wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
