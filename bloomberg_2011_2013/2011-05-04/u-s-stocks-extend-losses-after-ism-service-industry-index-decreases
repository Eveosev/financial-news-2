U.S. stocks extended losses after a
gauge of  service industries  unexpectedly decreased, damping
optimism about the health of the economy.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent to
1,347.87 at 10:02 a.m. in  New York . The  Dow Jones Industrial
Average  lost 76.82 points, or 0.6 percent, to 12,730.69.  The  Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non-
manufacturing companies slumped to 52.8 in April, the lowest
since August, from 57.3 a month earlier. The median forecast of
73 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was 57.5. Readings
greater than 50 signal growth for about 90 percent of the
economy. Estimates ranged from 54.5 to 59.       The S&P 500 rose 7.9 percent this year through yesterday
amid takeovers and higher-than-estimated corporate profits and
economic reports. Earnings-per-share beat estimates at 73
percent of the 357 companies in the  S&P 500  that reported
results since April 11, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
The S&P 500 is trading for about 15.34 times its companies’
reported operating earnings, compared with a five-year average
multiple of about 16.2.        Stock-index futures fell earlier as a report showed that
employment at U.S. companies increased by 179,000 in April,
according to figures from ADP Employer Services. The median
estimate in the Bloomberg News survey called for a 198,000
increase this month. Estimates ranged from a gain of 164,000 to
240,000, according to the Bloomberg survey of 34 economists.  Employment probably increased for a seventh straight month
in April, economists surveyed by Bloomberg News said ahead of
Labor Department data on May 6.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
