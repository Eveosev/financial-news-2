Public Power Corp SA (PPC) ,  Greece ’s biggest
electricity producer, may cancel plans to acquire wind parks
from Saudi Arabia-based BCI Group of Companies,  euro2day.gr 
reported.  No binding deal has been reached and negotiations for the
plan, under which  Public Power ’s PPC Renewables unit would
acquire the wind farms, are frozen, the Athens-based news site
