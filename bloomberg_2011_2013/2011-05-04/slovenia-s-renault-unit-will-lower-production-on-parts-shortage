The Slovenian unit of  Renault SA (RNO)  will
lower output because of a lack of electronic parts that were
produced in a tsunami-hit area of  Japan .  Revoz, as Slovenia’s largest exporter is known, will stop
producing cars on its night shift from May 23, the company,
based in the city of Novo Mesto, said in an e-mailed statement
today. The move means 520 job cuts, Revoz said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
