Ireland’s budget deficit widened by 41
percent in the four months through April from a year-earlier
period on bank-recapitalization costs.  The deficit of 9.9 billion euros ($14.7 billion) compared
with a shortfall of 7 billion euros a year earlier, the  Finance
Ministry  in Dublin said in a  statement  on its website today. Tax
revenue increased 6.7 percent on the year.  The increase in the deficit was primarily due to 3.1
billion euros in payments to Anglo Irish Bank Corp. and Irish
Nationwide Building Society, the ministry said.  Ireland’s government last week raised its estimate for the
general government deficit this year to 10 percent of gross
domestic product from 9.4 percent. The ministry said today it
will publish forecasts for the full-year exchequer returns in
July, once it has data for the first half of 2011.  Tax revenue was 108 million euros, or 1.1 percent, above
the ministry’s expectations, as levies on income and company
profits beat the government’s forecast for the January-April
period. Spending was 1.8 percent below forecast.  To contact the reporter on this story:
