Mauritian Finance Minister Pravind
Jugnauth said the government views rising inflation as a major
concern, Le Matinal reported.  Imported oil and food are driving up prices, Jugnauth told
the newspaper, commenting on an International Monetary Fund
country report released yesterday.  The IMF revised its forecast for 2011 inflation to 5.8
percent from an estimate of 5.25 percent in February. Inflation
rose for a sixth consecutive month to 7.2 percent in March,
