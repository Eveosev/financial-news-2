About 17 percent of global banks
clawed back compensation in 2011 as European and North American
regulators pressured firms to impose penalties on employee risk-
taking, according to consulting firm Mercer.  The survey found 44 percent of banks had clawback
provisions in place before 2011, with them more common in  North
America  than  Europe , the  Middle East  and  Africa  before that
year. However, a further 18 percent of banks have introduced
them since then in both regions, it said.  “Clawbacks are relatively new phenomena in compensation
programs so it will take some time for them to bed down,” Vicki
Elliott, global financial-services human capital leader at
Mercer, said in the statement. “A small number of clawbacks
doesn’t signify that the sector is ignoring lessons from the
financial crisis, but does raise legitimate questions about
whether companies will actually seek pay-back of compensation
paid.”  The introduction of clawbacks, or taking back compensation,
was spurred by the financial crisis of 2008 as governments and
regulators came under public pressure to curb bankers’ pay after
top executives whose banks collapsed or required government
bailouts walked away with hundreds of millions of dollars of
severance payments or accumulated pay packages.  In the U.K.,  Lloyds Banking Group Plc’s (LLOY)  former chief
executive officer,  Eric Daniels , will lose 25 percent of his
final bonus as he and four other current and former executives
are penalized for improperly sold insurance products, a person
with knowledge of the matter said in February.  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA) 
said in the same month it has clawed back bonuses for employees
because of the mis-selling of payment protection insurance.  The Mercer survey was completed by 63 financial-services
firms including banks and insurance firms, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
