Spanish Industry Minister Jose
Manuel Soria is preparing a plan to reduce the subsidies for
renewable energy producers after the Budget Ministry blocked his
proposal to claw back aid through taxes, El Mundo reported.  Soria will draw on a ruling by  Spain â€™s  Supreme Court  in
June to fight possible legal challenges from producers after
judges decided that lowering subsidies was justified should the
broader economic situation change, the newspaper said, citing
people at the ministry without naming them.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
