India ’s benchmark stock index ended
little changed as opposition from the government’s key ally to
economic reforms outweighed optimism that global central banks
may ease monetary policy to boost growth.  The BSE India  Sensitive Index (SENSEX) , or Sensex, gained less than
0.1 percent to 17,850.22 at the close. The measure earlier rose
its highest in six months.  Tata Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the
top software maker, increased to a record.  Reliance Industries
Ltd. (RIL) , owner of the world’s largest refining complex, fell for a
fourth day.  Pantaloon Retail India Ltd. (PF)  slid the most in two
weeks after  Mamata Banerjee , a key partner of Prime Minister
 Manmohan Singh ’s ruling alliance, said her party is not in favor
of allowing foreign direct investment in multi-brand retail and
airline industries.  The Sensex has increased 16 percent this year, helped by
surging overseas  investor  purchases amid optimism Singh will
revive reforms to boost an economy expanding at the slowest pace
in almost a decade. India’s budget and current-account deficits
in June prompted Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings to say they
may strip the nation of its investment-grade rating.  To contact the reporter on this story:
