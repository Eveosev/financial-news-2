U.K. stocks were little changed,
paring earlier gains, after a report showed the number of
Americans filing applications for  unemployment benefits  climbed
last week to a one-month high.  Petropavlovsk Plc plunged 18 percent, its biggest slump in
more than three years, as interest payments and depreciation
costs dragged down first-half profit.  The benchmark FTSE 100 Index rose 7.7, or 0.1 percent, to
5,778.8 at 1:49 p.m. in  London , after earlier rising as much as
0.6 percent. The broader FTSE All-Share Index also gained 0.1
percent, while Irelandâ€™s ISEQ Index declined 0.2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
