Treasuries rose, with 10-year notes
gaining for a fifth day in their longest winning streak since
April, as a jump in initial claims for jobless benefits boosted
speculation the  Federal Reserve  will add to monetary stimulus.  Thirty-year yields approached their low of the day after
Republican presidential challenger  Mitt Romney  said he doesn’t
back a third round of debt purchases under quantitative easing
by the Fed. The central bank, in minutes released yesterday of
its last meeting, signaled readiness to boost stimulus unless
it’s convinced the economy is poised to rebound. A sale of U.S.
five-year inflation-linked notes drew a record low yield.  “The minutes were incredibly dovish,” said  Brian Edmonds ,
head of interest rates at Cantor Fitzgerald LP in New York, one
of 21 primary dealers that trade with the Fed. “The minutes set
the tone. The market is taking it as if QE3 is in the bag.”  The 10-year Treasury note  yield  fell one basis point, or
0.01 percentage point, to 1.68 percent at 5:04 p.m.  New York 
time, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. It touched 1.66
percent, the lowest level since Aug. 14. The price of the 1.625
percent security due in August 2022 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 1/2.  Thirty-year yields fell one basis point to 2.79 percent.
They rose to 2.82 percent before the jobless claims data.  The long bond yields  fell  to 2.78 percent after Romney told
Fox Business the second round of quantitative easing didn’t work
and further action would hurt the dollar. He said he wants a
“new person” to replace  Ben S. Bernanke  as Fed chairman. The
yields touched 2.77 percent earlier before paring their decline.  “Marginally, it adds another level of uncertainty,” said
 Ian Lyngen , a government-bond strategist at CRT Capital Group
LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Volume Declines  Treasury trading  volume  reported by ICAP Plc, the largest
inter-dealer broker of  U.S. government debt , decreased to about
$250 billion, from $285 billion yesterday. Daily volume has
averaged $239 billion this year.  Volatility dropped to 65.5 basis points today in New York,
the lowest level since July 26, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index. The 2012 average is 74.6 basis
points. Volatility dropped to a five-year low of 56.7 basis
points on May 7 and touched a 2012 high of 95.4 basis points on
June 15. The index measures price swings based on options.  More Expensive  The term premium, a model created by economists at the Fed
that includes expectations for  interest rates , growth and
inflation, showed Treasuries were almost the most expensive
since Aug. 6. The gauge was negative 0.85 percent today, about
the same as yesterday, after reaching negative 0.70 percent on
Aug. 16, the least costly since May. It reached a record
negative 1.02 percent, the most expensive level ever, on July
24. A negative reading indicates investors are willing to accept
yields below what’s considered fair value.  The minutes of the Fed’s July 31-Aug. 1 meeting showed many
policy makers said additional stimulus would probably be needed
soon unless the economy shows signs of a durable pickup. Many
participants said a new large-scale asset-purchase program
“could provide additional support for the economic recovery,”
the record showed.  The Fed is increasingly likely to ease further in late 2012
or next year, and there’s a 50 percent chance it will announce a
form of quantitative easing at its September meeting, according
to Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of fundamental fixed-
income at New York-based BlackRock Inc., the world’s largest
money manager. He spoke in an interview with Deirdre Bolton on
Bloomberg Television’s “In The Loop.”  ‘Long Time’  “Employment is going to take a very long time to get to
the Fed’s mandate of full employment, which means they’re going
to be on hold for a long time,” Rieder said. “I thought their
comments yesterday were more aggressive than I think people
would have thought.”  Jobless claims increased by 4,000 for a second week to
reach 372,000 in the period ended Aug. 18, Labor Department data
showed today in  Washington . The median forecast of 41 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg called for 365,000. The four-week moving
average, a less volatile measure, increased to 368,000.  The U.S. sold $14 billion of five-year Treasury Inflation
Protected Securities, or TIPS, today at a record low  auction
yield  of negative 1.286 percent. The notes are due in April
2017. The size of the sale tied an April 2011 offering for the
second-largest auction ever of five-year TIPS. The $16 billion
offering this April was the biggest.  Increased Appetite  “It was strong any way you slice it,” Michael Pond, co-
head of interest-rate strategy in New York at the primary dealer
Barclays Plc, said in an e-mail. “Clearly, yesterday’s Fed
minutes have increased investors’ appetite for TIPS,
particularly at the short end of the curve.”  Investors bid for 3.11 times the amount offered, the
highest bid-to-cover ratio since April 2010, versus an average
of 2.64 at the past 10 auctions of the debt.  Indirect bidders , a category that includes foreign central
banks, bought 34.4 percent of the securities, compared with an
average of 36.5 percent at the past 10 offerings. Direct
bidders, non-primary-dealer investors that place their bids
directly with the Treasury, bought 15.2 percent, versus an
average 6.4 percent at the past 10 sales.  TIPS have returned 4.7 percent this year, compared with a
1.8 percent gain in the broader Treasuries market, according to
Bank of America Merrill Lynch indexes.  Note Sales  The Treasury said it will sell $35 billion of two-year debt
on Aug. 28, the same amount of five-year notes the following day
and $29 billion of seven-year securities on Aug. 30. The amounts
were unchanged from last month’s sales of the securities.  The Fed bought $1.8 billion today of Treasuries due from
November 2022 to February 2031. The purchase was part of the
central bank’s efforts to exchange shorter-term Treasuries in
its holdings for those due in six to 30 years to support the
economy by putting downward pressure on long-term borrowing
costs.  Treasuries gained earlier as  China ’s  purchasing managers’
index  fell to 47.8 in August from a final reading of 49.3 for
July, according to  HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  and Markit Economics.  To contact the reporter on this story:
