Borders & Southern Petroleum Plc (BOR) , a
U.K. explorer operating in the Falkland Islands, soared in
London trading after saying its Darwin field may yield about 190
million barrels of gas condensate.  Shares rose 59 percent, the most since it first sold shares
in May 2005, to close at 32.5 pence. Samples from the reservoir
indicated volumes of between 130 million and 250 million barrels
of condensate, a light crude oil produced in association with
gas, it said in a statement.  Borders & Southern rose as high as 131 pence earlier this
year on optimism about its Darwin and Stebbing prospects off the
South Atlantic islands that  Margaret Thatcher  went to war to
keep British in 1982. The company said last month that Stebbing
is unlikely to be commercial.  Based on the Darwin test results, Borders will now start a
new drilling program with both exploration and appraisal wells,
though the drilling is unlikely to start before 2014, it said
today. The company is exploring options for funding, including
bringing in partners, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
