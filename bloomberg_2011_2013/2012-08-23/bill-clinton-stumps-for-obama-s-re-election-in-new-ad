President  Barack Obama  is turning to
a familiar spokesman to make a direct appeal for his re-election
in November: former President  Bill Clinton .  The Obama campaign is releasing a new advertisement today
that features Clinton looking squarely into the camera, saying
that “this election to me is about which candidate is more
likely to return us to full employment.”  “This is a clear choice,”  Clinton says  in the 30-second
ad. “The Republican plan is to cut more taxes on upper income
people and go back to deregulation.”  The ad is meant to blunt a frequent charge from Republican
challenger  Mitt Romney  that Obama and Clinton differ
significantly on policy. Romney often cites Clinton as a
centrist Democrat who helped lower the deficit and grow the
economy, contrasting that record with the trillion-dollar
deficits that Obama has presided over in each of his three years
in office.  While Obama has enlisted Clinton’s help at two high-dollar
fundraising events this year, the commercial marks the first
direct advertising appeal that Clinton has made on behalf of the
man who defeated his wife, now-Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton , in the Democratic primary in 2008.  The Obama campaign said that the ad will air in New
Hampshire, Virginia,  North Carolina , Florida, Ohio, Iowa,
Colorado and Nevada, without specifying how much money it would
spend on airtime for the ad.  -- Editor: Michael Shepard  To contact the reporter on this story:
