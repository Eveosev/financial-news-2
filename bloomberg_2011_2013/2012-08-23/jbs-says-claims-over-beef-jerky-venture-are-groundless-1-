JBS SA (JBSS3) , the world’s largest beef
producer, said claims against its chief executive officer in a
lawsuit filed in the Netherlands by a former venture partner are
“groundless” and denied any wrongdoing.  A dispute between JBS and Link International Meat Products
Ltd. was settled in March 2011 by the  International Chamber of
Commerce , Sao Paulo-based JBS said in a statement today. Jay
Link, Link International’s controlling shareholder, “has lost
every one of the lawsuits filed against JBS as the original
decision by the arbitration chamber prevails.”  Link International and Jay Link filed a lawsuit in the
Netherlands against JBS CEO Wesley Batista “for intentional
corporate governance violations and other unlawful acts,” Link
International said in a statement distributed by  Business Wire 
yesterday.  JBS and Link International teamed up to form the Beef
Snacks International venture in 2007, a beef jerky producer
based in the Netherlands.  JBS climbed 1.2 percent to 6.04 reais at 2:24 p.m. in  Sao
Paulo . Earlier the stock rose to the highest intraday since July
5. Brazil’s Bovespa stock index dropped 1.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
