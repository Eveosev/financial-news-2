Euro-area  consumer confidence 
declined to the lowest since June 2009, adding to signs that the
single-currency bloc’s economy is sliding into a recession.  An index of household sentiment in the 17-nation euro area
dropped to minus 24.6 from minus 21.5 in July, the European
Commission in Brussels said in an initial estimate today.
Economists had forecast a drop to minus 22, the median of 27
estimates in a  Bloomberg survey  showed.  Europe’s economy is edging toward its second recession in
three years after budget cuts from Spain to Ireland prompted
companies to eliminate jobs and eroded  consumer spending . Euro-
area services and manufacturing industries contracted for a
seventh straight month in August, London-based Markit Economics
said today in an initial estimate.  The commission is scheduled to publish the wider indicator
of euro-area economic confidence on Aug. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
