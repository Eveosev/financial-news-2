World corn production will be
smaller than estimated a month ago after dry weather damaged
crops in the U.S., the International Grains Council forecast.  Farmers across the world will harvest 838 million metric
tons of corn in the 2012-13 crop year, down 3 percent from 864
million tons forecast on July 26 and below last year’s output of
875 million tons, the London-based council wrote in an e-mailed
report today. Corn prices surged 64 percent since mid-June on
the Chicago Board of Trade, touching a record $8.49 a bushel on
Aug. 10, as the worst U.S. drought in a half century cut yields.  “Drought has further stressed crops across the Northern
Hemisphere,” the IGC said. “Exportable supplies in the U.S.
and Ukraine have tightened and while the next crops in  Brazil ,
 Argentina  and  South Africa  may be large, harvests are still
several months away.”  Higher corn prices have boosted costs for ethanol makers
including Archer Daniels Midland Co. and meat producers
including  Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN)  and  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD) , which use
grains and soybean meal in  animal feed . The  United Nations 
estimated that global  food  costs surged 6.2 percent in July, the
most since November 2009, because of rising grain prices.  Corn production in the U.S., the world’s biggest grower and
exporter, may total 275 million tons, down from 300 million
estimated last month, the IGC said. The  U.S. Department of
Agriculture  has predicted a U.S. harvest of 273.8 million tons,
the smallest in six years, and global production of 849 million
tons.  Ukraine’s Corn  Ukraine, the world’s third-largest exporter in the previous
season after Argentina, may produce 20 million tons of corn, 4.8
percent less than forecast a month ago, the IGC said.  World wheat output was estimated at 662 million tons, down
from 665 million forecast last month, as dry weather eroded
crops in the  Black Sea region , the IGC said. The previous
season, the world’s farmers harvested a record 696 million tons.
The USDA expects global wheat output in the 2012-13 season to
total 662.8 million tons.  Russia ’s wheat crop may total 41 million tons, down from 45
million estimated in July, the IGC said. Milling-wheat futures
in Paris have surged 31 percent since mid-June on NYSE Liffe on
speculation that dry weather would spur Russia to restrict
exports. Paris wheat prices almost doubled in 2010, when severe
drought prompted Russia to ban grain shipments for 10 months.  Black Sea Outlook  Wheat prices have been “supported by a worsening outlook
for Black Sea and Australian wheat,” the IGC said. “ Black Sea 
exporters captured a high proportion of recent demand, but
availabilities were soon expected to become short.”  The IGC cut its forecast for Australia’s wheat crop to 23
million tons, from 24 million estimated last month. The European
Union may produce 133.1 million tons of the grain, more than
last month’s forecast of 132 million, the IGC said.  Global production of soybeans may be 255 million tons in
the 2012-13 season, up 7 percent from a year earlier, as South
American output rebounds, the IGC said. The USDA has estimated
the world harvest at 260.46 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
