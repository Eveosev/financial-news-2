U.K. 10-year government bonds stayed
higher even as a report showed mortgage approvals increased last
month.  The 10-year gilt yield was five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, lower at 1.59 percent as of 9:38 a.m. London
time.  Mortgage approvals rose 9.6 percent in July from the
previous month to 28,441, the British Bankers Association said
in an e-mailed statement today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
