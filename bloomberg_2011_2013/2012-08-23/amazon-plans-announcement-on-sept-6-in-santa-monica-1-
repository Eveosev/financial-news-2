Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , the world’s biggest
online retailer, will hold a press conference on Sept. 6 in
 Santa Monica , California.  The Seattle-based company may be preparing to announce
upgrades to its Kindle e-reader devices or the Kindle Fire, a
tablet that shows movies and other content, said Kerry Rice, an
analyst at Needham & Co. Inc.  “I’d assume it’s some more Kindle Fire models,” including
at least one with a 10-inch screen, said Rice, who has a hold
rating on Amazon. “They’ll be priced very competitively, at
lower price points than most, if not all their competitors.”  Amazon sent out invitations today to the event, which will
be held at the Barker Hangar. The online retailer gave no
details on what the meeting would be about. On Sept. 28 of last
year, Chief Executive Office  Jeff Bezos  unveiled the Kindle Fire
and other new devices.  Following  six quarters  of declining profit, Amazon
investors are looking for the company to refresh its product
line heading into the year-end holiday shopping season. The
company sold fewer Kindle Fires in the second quarter than in
the previous three months as customers held off on buying in
anticipation of a newer version, Mark Harding, an analyst at JMP
Securities LLC, said last month.  To contact the reporters on this story:
