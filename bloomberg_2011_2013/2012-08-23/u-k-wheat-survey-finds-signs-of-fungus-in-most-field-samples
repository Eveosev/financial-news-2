U.K. winter wheat testing found
crops showing signs of fungal disease in most field samples,
CropMonitor reported.  About 97 percent of wheat samples taken showed symptoms of
fusarium head blight, a fungal disease encouraged by wet weather
that can reduce yields, the crop-quality service reported on its
 website  today. Non-toxin producing species were responsible for
the majority of symptoms, according to the report.  About 45 percent of crops were infected with fusarium
graminearum, a fungus that can produce so-called mycotoxins, or
chemicals that can be harmful to humans and animals. Four
percent of those crops were infected with fusarium graminearum
in the ears, or the grain-bearing part of the  plant .  “The level of F. graminearum present in crops in 2012 is
far greater than the previous high seen in 2008,” CropMonitor
wrote. “Crops grown in the East Midlands are at the highest
risk of mycotoxin contamination, with F. graminearum infection
detected in 84 percent of crops and 8 percent of ears within an
infected crop.”  Fields in the West Midlands, Yorkshire and Humberside, as
well as in southern and eastern parts of the country, also face
a “high risk” of contamination, while fields in the north are
at a “low risk,” CropMonitor wrote.  CropMonitor is a service run by the Food & Environment
Research Agency, and partners include the Home-Grown Cereals
Authority, the Association of Independent Crop Consultants and
 Bayer AG (BAYN) ’s crop-chemical and seeds unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
