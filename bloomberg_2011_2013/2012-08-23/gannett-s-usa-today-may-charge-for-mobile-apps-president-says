(Corrects to clarify that  USA Today  has no plans to charge
for mobile applications in story that ran yesterday.)  Lawrence Kramer, president and
publisher of Gannett Co.’s USA Today, said the newspaper has no
plans to charge for online content or mobile applications.  “We have not even formally considered that possibility,”
he said.  Gannett has transferred about half of its 82 newspapers to
a pay model, contributing to a 13 percent gain in digital
revenue last quarter, though USA Today’s ad-supported website
hasn’t been part of that shift.  USA Today’s mobile traffic was “up strongly in June,”
with page views more than doubling from a year ago, Gracia Martore, Gannett’s chief executive officer, said during last
month’s earnings conference call. Digital revenue at USA Today
rose 37 percent last quarter from a year earlier.  Gannett’s newspapers reach 11.6 million weekday readers.
USA Today has more than 14.5 million downloads of its apps for
smartphones and tablets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
