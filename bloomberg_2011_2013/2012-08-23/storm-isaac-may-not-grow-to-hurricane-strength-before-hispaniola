Tropical Storm Isaac may not
strengthen into a hurricane before reaching Hispanola and Cuba
in the next two days, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said in
an advisory at 5 p.m. East Coast time.  Isaac is still expected to become a hurricane when it
reaches the Gulf of Mexico, the centerâ€™s tracking maps show.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
