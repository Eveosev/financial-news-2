U.S. stocks fell, as the Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index posted its biggest decline in a month, amid
investor concern that European leaders aren’t making progress in
solving the region’s debt crisis.  Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  dropped 8.2 percent after  forecasting 
full-year earnings that missed analysts’ estimates as demand
slumped.  Big Lots Inc. (BIG)  tumbled 21 percent after lowering its
annual earnings projection. Boeing Co. retreated 3.4 percent
after losing 35 orders for 787-9 planes, the biggest Dreamliner
cancellation.  Alcoa Inc. (AA)  erased 2.7 percent, pacing declines
among raw-material stocks.  The  S&P 500 (SPX)  slumped 0.8 percent to 1,402.08 at 4 p.m. in
New York. The benchmark index for American equities is heading
for its first weekly decline in almost two months, with a four-
day drop of 1.1 percent. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  lost
115.3 points, or 0.9 percent, to 13,057.46 today. Volume for
exchange-listed stocks in the U.S. was 5.3 billion shares, 16
percent below the three-month average.  “We’re tipping over into a corrective phase in stocks,”
 Barry James , who helps oversee $3.3 billion as president of
James Investment Research in Xenia, Ohio, said in a telephone
interview. “Europe is the key driver in the world right now.
European leaders aren’t really addressing the root problems.”  German Chancellor  Angela Merkel  said Europe is in one of
its deepest crises, and while the path to a solution is
“arduous,” the euro region will emerge stronger. She hosted
French President Francois Hollande today as the leaders of
Europe’s two biggest economies seek common ground on Greece and
the wider debt crisis. Greece’s prime minister, Antonis Samaras,
will follow Hollande to Berlin tomorrow and travel on to Paris
on Aug. 25.  Aid Program  Stocks extended declines after the European Union said it
is focused on its aid program for Spain’s banks and hasn’t
received a request for a full bailout from the euro-area nation.
Earlier, German Finance Minister  Wolfgang Schaeuble  said that
allowing Greece more time to meet its debt obligations would not
solve the country’s problems and would increase costs for
creditors.  “People aren’t willing to invest,” Stephen Hammers, the
chief investment officer at Brentwood, Tennessee-based Compass
EMP Funds, which manages about $1 billion in assets, said in a
telephone interview. “If Europe gets worse, U.S. investors will
see that as a warning sign.”  Investors also watched for signs of future monetary policy.
The  S&P 500  has rallied 9.7 percent since June 1 on speculation
global central banks will take action to stimulate growth. U.S.
stocks erased losses yesterday as minutes from the Federal Open
Market Committee’s last meeting showed many members judged that
more stimulus “would likely be warranted fairly soon.”  Stimulus Debate  James Bullard , the Fed Bank of St. Louis President, said
today on CNBC the minutes of this month’s meeting were no longer
as relevant because the  U.S. economy  has picked up in the past
month. Earlier, Fed Bank of Chicago President Charles Evans said
in Beijing that easing policies would support economic growth
around the world, including in China, broadening his call for
more stimulus in the U.S.  Purchases of  new U.S. homes  rose more than projected in
July. Sales climbed 3.6 percent to a 372,000 annual pace,
compared with the median estimate of 365,000. A separate report
showed the number of applications for  unemployment benefits 
climbed last week to a one-month high, showing little progress
in the labor market. Jobless claims rose for a second week to
reach 372,000. The median forecast called for 365,000.  China Manufacturing  A Chinese report today indicated that manufacturing will
contract at a faster pace in August, signaling the country’s
economy needs more stimulus to secure a rebound in growth. The
preliminary reading for a  purchasing managers’ index  for China
was 47.8. If confirmed, it would be the weakest level since
November and the 10th month that the reading has stayed below
50, the longest run in the index’s eight-year history.  Companies most tied to economic growth posted declines. The
Morgan Stanley  Cyclical Index (CYC)  fell for the fourth straight day,
losing 1.2 percent for the biggest drop in a month. The Dow
Jones Transportation Average, a gauge of 20 shipping companies
from  FedEx Corp. (FDX)  to  Southwest Airlines Co. (LUV) , tumbled 1 percent
for the biggest retreat since Aug. 1. The  KBW Bank Index (BKX) , made
up of 24  lenders , slid 1.1 percent.  Hewlett-Packard, the biggest maker of personal computers,
dropped 8.2 percent to $17.64 for the  biggest decline  in a year.
Profit excluding some costs will be $4.05 to $4.07 a share in
the year that ends in October, Palo Alto, California-based
Hewlett-Packard said yesterday in a statement. That’s at the low
end of a forecast for $4.05 to $4.10 issued in May and below the
average $4.08 analyst estimate compiled by Bloomberg.  Slumping Demand  The company suffered another quarter of slumping demand for
personal computers and services aimed at businesses,
underscoring the turnaround challenge facing Chief Executive
Officer  Meg Whitman .  Other technology stocks also declined.  Intel Corp. (INTC) , the
world’s largest chipmaker, slid 2.7 percent to $25.04, while
 Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) , the biggest software maker, slumped 0.9 percent
to $30.26.  Big Lots, the Columbus, Ohio-based discount retailer,
plunged 21 percent to $30.76 for the  biggest drop  in the S&P
500. Profit excluding some items will decline to $2.80 to $2.95
a share this year, reduced from a previous projection of $3.25
to $3.40 a share. Analysts anticipated $3.30, the average of 16
estimates compiled by Bloomberg.  Boeing slumped 3.4 percent to $70.36, after losing 35
orders for 787-9 planes, the biggest Dreamliner cancellation, as
Qantas Airways Ltd. scrapped a contract after delivery delays
and losses on international routes. Qantas’s pullback on jets
worth about $8.5 billion at current list prices reduced Chicago-
based  Boeing (BA) ’s backlog for the 787-9 by about 10 percent.  Alcoa, DuPont  Raw-material stocks fell 1.7 percent for the biggest drop
out of  10 groups  in the S&P 500. Alcoa, the largest aluminum
producer in the U.S., erased 2.7 percent to $8.63, while DuPont
Co., the most valuable U.S. chemicals producer, lost 1.1 percent
to $50.24.  Patterson Cos. tumbled 4.9 percent to $34.15. The  St. Paul ,
Minnesota-based maker of medical devices for dental and
veterinary clinics reported first-quarter earnings of 45 cents a
share, missing the average analyst estimate by 4 cents.  Guess? Inc. (GES) , an apparel maker that operates 511 stores in
the U.S. and Canada, sank 23 percent to $25.95 after cutting its
annual profit and revenue forecasts amid a drop in North
American store sales. Comparable-store sales, a measure of a
retailer’s growth that excludes new stores, fell 8.5 percent in
the quarter ended July 28.  To contact the reporter on this story:
