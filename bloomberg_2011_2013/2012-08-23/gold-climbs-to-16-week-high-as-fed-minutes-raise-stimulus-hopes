Gold advanced to the highest in more
than four months amid speculation that the U.S. will take
additional steps to spur economic growth, boosting the appeal of
bullion as an inflation hedge. Platinum extended a rally.  Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 31-
Aug. 1 meeting showed that “many members” believed more
monetary accommodation would be needed unless the recovery picks
up. Holdings in exchange-traded products backed by gold rose to
a record, Bloomberg data shows. The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot
Index of 24 commodities rose to the highest since May 2.  “Gold is exploding today as inflation concerns are back,”
 Adam Klopfenstein , the senior market strategist at Archer
Financial Services Inc. in  Chicago , said in a telephone
interview. “A combination of rising commodity prices and the
chances of more easing coming in the U.S. is stoking inflation
worries.”  Gold futures for December delivery climbed 2 percent to
settle at $1,672.80 an ounce at 1:38 p.m. on the Comex in  New
York  after earlier jumping to $1,677.50, the highest for a most-
active contract since April 13.  The metal rose above the 200-day moving average yesterday
for the first time since March. Some investors look at the
signal as an important technical level, and that may have
spurred more buying, Commerzbank AG said today.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 3 percent to
$30.542 an ounce in New York, after reaching $30.87, the highest
since May 2.  Longest Stretch  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery gained 1.9 percent to $1,554.90 an ounce after
reaching $1,563.60, the highest for a most active contract since
May 3. Prices increased for a sixth session, the longest stretch
since Oct. 28.  About a fifth of global platinum production capacity was
idled in  South Africa  today as the nation held a day of mourning
for 44 miners and policemen killed in the deadliest police
violence since apartheid ended.  Palladium futures for September delivery advanced 4.4
percent to $656.60 an ounce on the Nymex, the biggest gain this
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
