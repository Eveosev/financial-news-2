Kenya ’s shilling weakened the most
in more than a week as oil importers sought dollars.  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy depreciated
0.2 percent to 84 a dollar as of 12:32 p.m. in Nairobi, the
biggest decline since Aug. 14.  “The shilling is trading within a tight range although we
have seen some demand from the oil sector,” Sameer Lagadia,
head of trading at Nairobi-based  Diamond Trust Bank Kenya Ltd. (DTKL) ,
said in a phone interview today.  Oil rose for a third day in New York after stockpiles
declined more than analysts projected and speculation mounted
that central banks in the U.S. and China will boost economic
stimulus. Kenya imports all the oil it consumes.  The Tanzanian shilling retreated 0.3 percent to 1,575 a
dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling dropped 0.8 percent to 2,520.50
versus the U.S. currency, the weakest since June 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
