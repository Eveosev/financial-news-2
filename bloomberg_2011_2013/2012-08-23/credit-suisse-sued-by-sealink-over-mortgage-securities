Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  was sued in
 New York  state court by Sealink Funding Ltd. over its investment
in $180 million worth of residential mortgage-backed securities.  Sealink accuses Zurich-based Credit Suisse of making
material misrepresentations and omissions regarding the
characteristics of  mortgage loans  that were pooled together into
the securities, according to documents filed in New York state
Supreme Court in Manhattan today.  Credit Suisse, Switzerland’s second-biggest bank, didn’t
immediately respond to a phone message left on its media hotline
in New York seeking comment on the lawsuit.  Sealink was created to manage Landesbank Sachsen AG’s
riskiest assets after the German lender almost collapsed. It has
filed lawsuits over investments in mortgage bonds against banks
including Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Deutsche Bank AG, Bank of
America Corp. and JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Pools of home loans securitized into bonds were a central
part of the housing bubble that helped send the U.S. into the
biggest recession since the 1930s. The housing market collapsed,
and the crisis swept up lenders and investment banks as the
market for the securities evaporated.  The case is Sealink Funding Ltd. v. Credit Suisse Holdings
(USA) Inc., 652962/2012, New York State  Supreme Court , New York
County (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
