Nigeria , Africa’s largest oil
producer, will export one cargo of Pennington crude for October,
unchanged from September, according to a loading plan obtained
by  Bloomberg News .  The loading program of Amenam for October was revised
higher, to two shipments, after one consignment for the end of
September was deferred into October, a separate plan showed. All
cargoes are for 950,000 barrels.  The shipping schedule of Erha isn’t available yet. Loading
programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by
field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply
and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
