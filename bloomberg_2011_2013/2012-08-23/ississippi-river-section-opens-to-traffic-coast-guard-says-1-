The  U.S. Coast Guard  opened a
section of the  Mississippi River  to traffic following an
inspection after vessel groundings because of shallow water.  Southbound traffic was allowed on the 11-mile stretch of
the river between mile markers 524 and 535 near Greenville,
 Mississippi , Petty Officer 3rd Class Ryan Tippets, a New
Orleans-based public affairs officer for the Coast Guard, said
in a telephone interview.  About 40 vessels moved overnight, leaving 29 southbound and
36 northbound awaiting passage, he said. Northbound ships will
be allowed after southbound traffic clears and inspections of
the river are finished, Tippets said.  Drought across the Midwest has left the Mississippi River
system, which includes the Ohio and Missouri rivers, with low
water levels that have impeded and delayed barge traffic.  At least two groundings occurred this week in the area that
was closed, Tippets said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
