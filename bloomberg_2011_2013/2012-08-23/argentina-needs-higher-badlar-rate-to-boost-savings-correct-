(Corrects currency conversion in second paragraph.)  Argentina ’s benchmark  30-day deposit
rate  may need to rise to a range of 14 percent to 16 percent in
order to help boost savings, said Claudio Cesario, president of
the country’s Banks Association.  The rate paid for deposits of at least 1 million pesos
($217,000), known as badlar, fell to 13 percent on Aug. 21 from
14.1 percent on Aug. 17 as peso-deposits rose 20 percent in the
year to 329.8 billion pesos on Aug. 10, according to the central
bank. The rate was as high as 17.5 percent on Jan. 3, when
deposits totalized 273.8 billion pesos.  “The banks’ main goal is to take care of depositors, so it
wouldn’t make sense to cut rates,” Cesario told reporters today
in  Buenos Aires . “If demand for loans keeps rising, we’ll have
to try to bring in more deposits.”  Loans to the private sector rose 14.9 percent in the year
to 342 billion pesos, according to the central bank figures.
About half of the loans were granted to companies, 35 percent to
consumption and 15 percent in mortgages and leasing, Cesario
said.  Banks have suffered overall deposit withdrawals last year
as Argentines took $21.5 billion out of the country in a bid to
protect their savings from a weaker peso and one of the region’s
highest inflation rates.  Since being reelected by a landslide in October, President
 Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner  has tightened controls on the
exchange market and forced companies to repatriate export
revenue in a bid to stem capital outflows.  To contact the reporter on this story:
