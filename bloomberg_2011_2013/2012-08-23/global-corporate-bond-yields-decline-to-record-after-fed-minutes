Yields on corporate bonds worldwide
fell to a record low yesterday after Federal Reserve policy
makers signaled readiness to boost stimulus options.  Borrowing costs for the most creditworthy to the riskiest
companies fell to an unprecedented 3.76 percent yesterday, from
3.8 percent on Aug. 21, according to Bank of America Merrill
Lynch index data. Yields on global investment-grade debt  dropped 
to a record 2.97 percent.  Rates are falling, with  relative yields  on company bonds
reaching the narrowest level in a year, after many members of
the Fed’s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee said
further action would probably be needed “fairly soon” without
evidence of “substantial and sustainable” improvement in the
country’s economic recovery, according to minutes of the July
31-Aug. 1 meeting.  “Rates markets shifted into full-on rally mode” after the
Fed signaled “an increasing bias toward additional stimulus,”
Guy LeBas, chief fixed-income strategist at Janney Montgomery
Scott LLC in Philadelphia, wrote today in a report.  The extra yield investors demand to own global corporate
bonds of all ratings rather than government debt narrowed to 261
basis points Aug. 21, the lowest level since August 2011, Bank
of America Merrill Lynch index data show. The gauge widened 1
basis point to 2.62 percentage points yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
