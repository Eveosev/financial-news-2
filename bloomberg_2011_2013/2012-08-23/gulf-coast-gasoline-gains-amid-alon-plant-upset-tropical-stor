Gulf Coast gasoline strengthened
after  Alon USA Energy Inc. (ALJ)  reported emissions from a catalytic
cracker at a Texas refinery and a tropical storm moved toward
the U.S. refining center.  Alonâ€™s Big Spring plant had emissions from a boiler and
fluid catalytic cracker after the rupture of a boiler tube,
according to a filing yesterday with the Texas Commission on
Environmental Quality. Tropical Storm Isaac is forecast to
strengthen and cross Haiti and Cuba before arriving on the
southwestern Florida coast Aug. 27, the National Hurricane
Center said.  The premium for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast rose 1.25 cents to 9.5 cents a gallon versus October
futures traded on the  New York Mercantile Exchange  at 12:10
p.m., according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery
rose 3.55 cents to $3.0562 a gallon.  The  premium  for ultra-low-sulfur diesel in the Gulf slipped
0.25 cent to 8.5 cents versus heating oil futures, the lowest
level since Aug. 16.  To contact the reporter on this story:
