Henderson Land Development Co. (12) , the
 Hong Kong  builder controlled by billionaire Lee Shau-kee,
reported first-half profit that beat estimates as higher rental
income and earnings from its energy businesses offset lower
property sales. Shares rose to the highest in a year.  Underlying profit , which excludes revaluation gains,
advanced to HK$3.59 billion ($463 million) in the six months
ended June 30, from HK$3.43 billion a year earlier, the company
said in a stock exchange statement. That compares with the
HK$2.7 billion median estimate of three analysts surveyed by
 Bloomberg News . The shares rose as much as 6.4 percent and
finished trading in Hong Kong 4.7 percent higher at HK$49.05,
the highest since Aug.2, 2011.  “This was above our estimate,” Morgan Stanley analysts,
led by Praveen Choudhary, said in a note to clients today. “The
stock remains attractively valued, especially given the prospect
of much better market share -- or pre-sale -- over the next six
to nine months.”  Henderson Land  and developers including billionaire Li Ka-
shing’s  Cheung Kong  (Holdings) Ltd. are reporting lower
apartment sales in the first half as the city’s government
pledged to increase housing supply to curb prices that have
gained more than 80 percent since early 2009. Hong Kong
developers sold 5,530 homes in the first half, the third-lowest
for a six-month period since the start of 2006.  Revenue from property sales was HK$4.28 billion in the first
half, almost half the HK$8 billion a year ago. The company said
more than 4,000 homes will be available for sale in the second
half of 2012.  Home Sales  “The deepening debt crisis in  Europe  and slowdown in the
global economy had affected the Hong Kong economy,” the company
said. Still, “pay rises, thriving inbound tourism, low  interest
rates  and a rising inflationary environment are expected to lend
support to housing demand.”  The company, founded by Lee in 1973, said rental income
rose to HK$2.19 billion in the first half, from HK$1.87 billion
a year ago. Property rental operating profit jumped 22 percent
to HK$1.5 billion from a year ago, boosted by higher occupancy
at Henderson Metropolitan in  Shanghai  and World Financial Centre
in Beijing.  Profit was also helped by contributions from units.
Henderson’s share of underlying profit from associates in the
six months rose 26 percent to HK$1.67 billion from HK$1.33
billion a year earlier.  Energy Units  Hong Kong & China Gas Co. posted a HK$4.1 billion profit in
the first half, an increase of HK$897.4 million from a year
earlier, boosted by earnings from  China  and a one-time gain,
Henderson said in the statement. The utility’s unit, Towngas
China Co., had an 18 percent jump in profit to HK$357 million,
the developer said.  Hong Kong Ferry (Holdings) Co. also posted a 29 percent gain
in profit to HK $274.9 million in the first half, it said, while
Miramar Hotel and Investment Co.’s net income climbed 4 percent
to HK$665 million.  Hong Kong builders usually begin selling homes while they’re
still being constructed and book profit upon completion.  Transactions in the city have slowed because of curbs
imposed by the government to prevent the formation of an asset
bubble. The number of homes sold in the first seven months of
2012 fell 22 percent to 46,910, from the same period a year
earlier, according to data released by the  Land Registry .  Lee, 84, is 31st on the  Bloomberg Billionaires Index  with a
net worth of $19.2 billion.  The builder, the fifth-biggest developer in the benchmark
Hang Seng Property Index. The stock’s gain today increased its
advance this year to 27 percent, compared with the 19 percent
gain in the seven-member gauge.  Including revaluation net of non-controlling interests and
deferred taxes, profit fell 12 percent to HK$7.7 billion, or
HK$3.26 a share, from HK$8.82 billion, or HK$3.92 a share, a
year earlier, the company said.  Henderson will pay an interim dividend of 32 Hong Kong
cents, compared with 30 cents a year earlier.  To contact the reporters on this story:
