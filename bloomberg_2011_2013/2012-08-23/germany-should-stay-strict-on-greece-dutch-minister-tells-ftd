Germany should stick to its strict
position with  Greece  because delaying measures won’t help
anyone, Financial Times Deutschland reported citing an interview
with Dutch Finance Minister Jan Kees  de Jager .  De Jager said he wasn’t totally opposed to a delay in
reaching fiscal targets, though only if this was because of
further economic weakening, the newspaper reported.  He added that it was becoming increasingly difficult to
explain the aid to a domestic audience, the FTD said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
