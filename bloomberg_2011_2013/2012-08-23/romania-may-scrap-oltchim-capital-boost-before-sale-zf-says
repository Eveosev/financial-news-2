Romania’s Economy Ministry may
abandon a planned capital increase in  Oltchim SA (OLT) , a chemical
company, before selling its majority stake,  Ziarul Financiar 
reported, citing Remus Vulpescu, who heads the ministry’s office
responsible for industrial-asset sales.  The ministry, which had planned to boost Oltchim’s capital
by as much as 2 billion lei ($558 million) by converting a debt
owed to the state into shares, may scrap the plan after failing
to reach agreement with minority  shareholders , ZF said.  The authorities will try to sell Oltchim’s debt together
with the state’s majority stake, Vulpescu told the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
