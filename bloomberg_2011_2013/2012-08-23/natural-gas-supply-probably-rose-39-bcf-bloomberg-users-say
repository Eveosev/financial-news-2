The U.S. Energy Department’s
natural-gas inventory report, scheduled for release at 10:30
a.m. in  Washington , will show that supplies rose 1.2 percent
last week, according to a survey of Bloomberg users.  The government’s report will show that inventories gained
39 billion cubic feet in the week ended Aug. 17 to 3.3 trillion
cubic feet, according to the survey.  Natural gas for September delivery fell 4.6 cents, or 1.6
percent, to $2.78 per million British thermal units on the  New
York  Mercantile Exchange at 10:22 a.m.  Bloomberg compiles the anonymous survey based on estimates
by at least 100 users each week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
