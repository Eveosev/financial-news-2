German tax authorities in North
Rhine-Westphalia paid 3.5 million euros ($4.4 million) for three
sets of data containing information about clients of Coutts, a
wealth management unit of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , a
wealth management unit of Merrill Lynch and  UBS AG (UBSN) , Bilanz
reported, citing unidentified German judiciary sources.  Tax authorities got data on almost 1,000 clients of Coutts,
more than 1,000 clients of UBS and a “smaller” number of Merrill
Lynch clients, the Swiss magazine reported. The authorities are
investigating whether a UBS unit Corpboard Ltd. may have been
used to help clients evade taxes through foundations and trusts,
the magazine also said.  “UBS restructured its foundations business in the summer
of 2009 and no longer offers any new foundations for German
clients,” Zurich-based UBS said in an e-mailed statement today.
“Foundations and trusts are only permitted for selected markets
and subject to the strictest possible regulations on  money
laundering  and tax compliance.”  Olivia Phillips, a spokeswoman for Coutts, said the bank is
“aware of the continued media speculation regarding a potential
breach of client data secrecy. Following thorough investigation,
we have no evidence to suggest any such breach has taken
place.”  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
