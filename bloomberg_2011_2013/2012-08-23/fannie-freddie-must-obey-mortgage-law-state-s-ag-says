Fannie Mae and  Freddie Mac  were
warned by Massachusetts Attorney General  Martha Coakley  to
comply with a new state law aimed at reducing foreclosures by
requiring mortgage loan modifications.  The companies must offer “commercially reasonable”
changes under legislation signed into law Aug. 3 by Governor
 Deval Patrick , Coakley’s office said today in a statement.  “We expect Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, like all creditors,
to comply with these statutory obligations,” Coakley said in a
letter to the Federal Housing Finance Agency. “We expect that
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will pursue common-sense loan
modifications for borrowers when the economic benefits of a
modified loan exceed the significant losses anticipated at
foreclosure.”  Under the law, creditors must modify certain loans when the
value of the modified loan is greater than the anticipated
recovery from a foreclosure. They must also show they are the
legal mortgage-holders when foreclosing on homes.  Coakley also urged the FHFA, which regulates Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, to reduce loan principal balances for struggling
homeowners.  A spokeswoman for the FHFA, Stefanie Johnson, declined to
comment immediately on the attorney general’s letter.  To contact the reporter on this story:
