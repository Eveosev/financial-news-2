Treasuries snapped a four-day rally
before the U.S. sells $14 billion of inflation protected
securities today and announces the sizes of three note auctions
set for next week.  U.S. securities have handed investors a 0.9 percent loss
this month, based on Bank of America Merrill Lynch data,
following a report Aug. 3 that showed better-than-predicted jobs
growth.  New home sales  may have rebounded in July, a Bloomberg
News analyst survey indicated before Commerce Department data
today. Many Federal Reserve policy makers said more stimulus
will probably be needed soon unless the economy shows signs of a
durable pickup, minutes of their last meeting showed yesterday.  Ten-year Treasury  yields  increased one basis point to 1.70
percent as of 11:45 a.m. in  Tokyo , according to Bloomberg Bond
Trader data. The price of the 1.625 percent security due in
August 2022 slid 2/32, or 63 cents per $1,000 face amount, to 99
9/32. The yield yesterday dropped 11 basis points, or 0.11
percentage point, after the Fed report. It was the biggest slide
since May 30.  “It’s no longer nearly as attractive as it was a few days
ago,” said Andy Cossor, a Hong Kong-based market strategist at
DZ Bank AG,  Germany ’s fourth-largest lender.  Japan ’s benchmark 10-year rate fell one basis point to 0.81
percent, dropping for a third day.  Debt Auctions  Five-year Treasury Inflation Protected Securities  yielded 
negative 1.22 percent, compared with negative 1.08 percent at
the last auction of the securities on April 19, which was a
record low.  Investors bid for 2.58 times the amount of debt offered
four months ago, versus the average of 2.64 for the past 10
sales.  Indirect bidders , the investor class that includes foreign
central banks, bought 36 percent of the securities, the least in
two years.  The U.S. will probably sell $35 billion of two-year debt on
Aug. 28, the same amount of five-year notes the following day
and $29 billion of seven-year securities on Aug. 30, according
to Wrightson ICAP LLC, an economic advisory company based in
 Jersey City ,  New Jersey .  Maturing Treasuries available for reinvestment will total
$50.4 billion, and the auctions will raise $48.6 billion of new
cash, according to Wrightson. The government issues the
combination of two-, five- and seven-year notes every month.  The Fed yesterday released records of its July 31-Aug. 1
policy meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee’s next
gathering is scheduled for Sept. 12-13.  To contact the reporter on this story:
