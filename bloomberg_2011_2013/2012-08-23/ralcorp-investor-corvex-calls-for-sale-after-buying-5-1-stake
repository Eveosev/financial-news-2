Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH)  investor
Corvex Management LP said the maker of Raisin Bran cereals
should pursue three alternatives to boost  shareholder value ,
including a merger with another food company.  Corvex acquired a 5.1 percent  stake  in St. Louis-based
Ralcorp and said the company should also consider putting itself
up for sale or embark on a new strategy focusing on takeovers,
according to a regulatory filing today.  Ralcorp, which sells cookies and pasta under retailers’ own
brands, rejected a $5.18 billion takeover bid from  ConAgra Foods
Inc. (CAG)  last year, saying it would spin off its Post Foods unit
instead and focus on private-label goods. In May, Ralcorp said
it would restate results for fiscal 2011 and first quarter of
2012 after understating an impairment charge related to the
spinoff of Post, which occurred in February.  Corvex, based in New York, said the “status quo is
unacceptable” and Ralcorp has had “several serious execution
issues since the Post separation including disappointing
earnings.”  Matt Pudlowski, a Ralcorp spokesman, didn’t immediately
return a phone call seeking comment.  Ralcorp  rose  2.4 percent to $70.02 at 10:22 a.m. in New
York. The shares had dropped 5.7 percent this year through
yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
