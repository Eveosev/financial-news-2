Chad plans to export four cargoes of
Doba crude in October including one lot deferred from September,
according to a loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News .  Shipments in September were revised down to three
consignments from four, the plan showed. All cargoes are for
950,000 barrels each.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  operates the field. Loading programs are
monthly schedules of crude shipments compiled by field operators
to allow buyers and sellers to plan their supply and trading
activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
