Vietnam demanded  Taiwan 
“immediately cancel” a live-fire drill on islands it claims as
its own, according to a statement on the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs website today.  Taiwan plans to stage the exercise on Taiping Island, in
the disputed Spratly island chain in the  South China Sea , next
month, the China Post reported Aug. 21.  The action “severely violates Vietnam’s sovereignty,
threatens peace, stability, security, marine safety, causes
tensions and complicates the situation in the East Sea,”,
Ministry spokesman Luong Thanh Nghi said in the statement, using
the Vietnamese term for the South China Sea.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
