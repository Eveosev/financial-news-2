Denmark’s biggest pension fund ATP
is shifting more of its investment over to longer-term bonds
after short-term yields in Denmark and  Germany  sank below zero.  “We’ve not invested in the very short maturities,” said
Henrik Gade Jepsen, chief investment officer at the Hilleroed,
Denmark-based fund. In ATP’s investment portfolio, which holds
311 billion kroner ($52 billion) in assets, “we’ve move further
out the yield curve,” and the fund almost only owns government
bonds with five- to 10-year maturity now, he said.  Danish two-year yields dropped below zero at the beginning
of July, and traded as low as minus 0.09 percent on July 31.
Germany has charged investors to hold its two-year since the
beginning of last month. ATP only holds government bonds from
the two countries, Jepsen said.  The fund only holds assets deemed “safe havens by
investors,” Jepsen said. “We’d like to have assets in our
portfolio that do well when stocks do badly. So we don’t have
any bonds in our portfolio that have performed badly as a result
of the euro crisis.”  ATP, which last year renegotiated contracts to avoid having
to accept French  government bonds  as collateral, today said net
income in the first six months of the year declined 52 percent
after profit from investments dropped.  Net income fell to 3.93 billion kroner from 8.13 billion
kroner a year earlier, the fund said today. Investment profit
after tax declined to 4.44 billion kroner from 8.41 billion
kroner.  To contact the reporter on this story:
