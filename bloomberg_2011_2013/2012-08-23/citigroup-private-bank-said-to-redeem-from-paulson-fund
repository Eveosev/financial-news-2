Citigroup Inc.’s (C)  private bank is
pulling about $410 million from Paulson & Co., the hedge fund
seeking to reverse record losses in 2011, according to two
people familiar with the matter.  The private bank is redeeming from Paulson’s Advantage Fund
and Advantage Plus Fund, said the people, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private. Citigroup is also
pulling from the Merger and Recovery Funds, the people said.  Armel Leslie , a spokesman for New York-based Paulson, which
manages $19.5 billion, and Natalie Marin, a spokeswoman for
Citigroup, also based in New York, declined to comment.  The hedge fund, run by billionaire  John Paulson , lost 18
percent this year through July in its Advantage Plus strategy,
according to a monthly investor update. That fund, one of the
firm’s largest, posted a loss of 51 percent last year.
Citigroup’s private bank, which told clients this morning of
their plans to withdraw from Paulson funds, in May advised
clients not to add money to them, a person familiar with the
matter said at the time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
