Sugar output in  Brazil ’s Center
South, the world’s biggest-producing region, climbed 14 percent
in the first half of this month as growers accelerated
harvesting amid dry weather, industry association Unica said.  Output rose to 3.02 million metric tons between Aug. 1 and
Aug. 15 from 2.66 million tons a year earlier, Sao Paulo-based
Unica said in an e-mailed statement today.  Sugar-cane growers harvested 44.2 million tons in the
period, up 14 percent from 38.7 million tons a year earlier,
while ethanol output rose 8.1 percent to 1.75 billion liters
(463 million gallons).  Mills in the Center South, which processes about 90 percent
of Brazil’s sugar and ethanol, turned 51.4 percent of the cane
into sugar, up from 50.2 percent a year earlier. The rest was
converted into ethanol.  Crops yielded 139.5 kilograms (307 pounds) of sucrose, the
substance that’s processed into sugar and ethanol, for every ton
of cane in the first half of this month. That compares with
143.5 kilograms per ton a year earlier.  Brazil’s Center South is forecast to produce at least 509
million tons of cane this season, which started April 1, Unica’s
chairman Pedro Parente said yesterday. Output was 493.2 million
tons in the previous season.  To contact the reporter on this story:
