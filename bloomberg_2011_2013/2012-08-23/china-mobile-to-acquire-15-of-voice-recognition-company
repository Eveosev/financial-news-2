China Mobile Ltd., the world’s
biggest phone company by users, agreed to buy a 1.36 billion
 yuan  ($214 million) stake in  Anhui USTC iFlytek Co. , a maker of
voice-recognition software similar to  Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s Siri system.  The phone carrier will subscribe to 70.3 million  Anhui USTC (002230) 
shares, or a 15 percent stake, at 19.40 yuan apiece,  Beijing-
based China Mobile said in a filing to the Hong Kong stock
exchange yesterday. Anhui USTC rose by the 10 percent daily
limit to 26.61 yuan at the close in Shenzhen after trading in
the stock resumed.  China Mobile will collaborate with Anhui USTC on Mandarin
voice technology after the transaction is completed, according
to the filing. China Mobile is boosting spending on networks and
increasing handset subsidies to attract smartphone users to lift
 profit growth  as competition intensifies.  IFlytek was founded in 1999 based on research conducted in
the National Intelligent Computer Research and Development
Center and the Human-Machine Speech Communication Laboratory of
the University of Science and Technology of China, the company
said on its website. The Hefei, Anhui province-based company
