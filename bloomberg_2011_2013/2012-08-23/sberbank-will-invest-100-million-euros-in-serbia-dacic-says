OAO Sberbank plans to invest 100
million euros ($125.76 million) in Serbia by the end of the
year, Serbian Prime Minister  Ivica Dacic ’s office said.  The Russian bank has already invested 100 million euros in
Serbia to date and plans to invest as much by the end of the
year, Dacic said in the statement. Sberbank will help Serbia
find a strategic buyer for its Smederevo steelworks, he said.  OAO Sberbank entered the market through a unit of Austria’s
Volksbank International AG.  Serbia is increasingly looking at Russia for cash to
finance its  budget deficit . Dacic’s Cabinet, sworn in on July
27, is trying to add jobs and bolster the economy, which fell
into recession for the second time in three years. The
government has been trying to find a buyer for  Zelezara
Smederevo d.o.o.  since January, when the former owner, U.S.
Steel Corp. sold it back to the government for $1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
