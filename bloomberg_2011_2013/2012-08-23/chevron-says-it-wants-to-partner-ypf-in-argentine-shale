Chevron Corp. (CVX)  said today it wants to
partner with  YPF SA (YPFD) , Argentina’s biggest oil producer, in
developing the company’s Vaca Muerta shale formation.  “We are open to strategically partnering with YPF,”  Ali Moshiri , president of Chevron’s Africa and Latin America
exploration and production unit, told reporters in Buenos Aires.
“We are looking forward to working with the government.”  Moshiri spoke after YPF Chief Executive Officer Miguel Galuccio said in a speech that the state-controlled company will
unveil its contract model on Aug. 30 for three types of
partnerships to develop Vaca Muerta. YPF, seized from Repsol SA
in April, needs financial and operational partners, he said.  Vaca Muerta is a Connecticut-size area in southern
Argentina that may contain at least 23 billion barrels. Galuccio
described the shale formation as the “tip of the iceberg” for
YPF’s oil projects. The company, based in Buenos Aires, has
drilled 45 wells at the shale development.  Argentine President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
nationalized YPF in April, saying Madrid-based Repsol under-
invested since it acquired YPF in 1999.  YPF also plans to drill for coal-bed methane gas in Buenos
Aires Province, Gallucio said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
