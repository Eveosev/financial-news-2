The  Philippine peso  gained the most
this month after data showed the nation’s balance of payments
surged to a  20-month high  and the central bank said it stands
ready to act to keep the financial system stable.  Stronger fund inflows are boosting the nation’s external
position, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas Governor Amando Tetangco
said in a mobile-phone message yesterday, after official figures
showed the balance of payments stood at $3.18 billion in July.
The peso rose after minutes of the most recent meeting of U.S.
policy makers, released yesterday, signaled they will consider
more asset purchases that boost dollar supply, known as
quantitative easing, unless the American economy improves.  “Much of the peso’s strength is the result of the  Federal
Reserve ’s meeting, which boosted expectation of quantitative
easing,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in
 Singapore . “The Philippines’ strong balance of payments in July
and the governor’s comments also help.”  The peso climbed 0.4 percent to 42.115 per dollar as of
4:13 p.m in  Manila , the biggest gain since July 31, Tullett
Prebon Plc prices showed. It touched 42.107 earlier, the highest
level since Aug. 15. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, increased three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 6.23 percent.  International investors boosted holdings of Philippine
stocks by $2.1 billion this year, exchange data show.  The nation reported a budget deficit of 39.2 billion pesos
($931 million), a third monthly shortfall, according to an
official report released today. The government targets to cap
the deficit at 279 billion pesos this year, or 2.6 percent of
gross domestic product.  Bonds were little changed with the yield on the 9.125
percent debt due September 2016 holding steady at 4.4 percent,
according to Tradition Financial Services.  To contact the reporter on this story:
