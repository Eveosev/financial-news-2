Opap SA (OPAP) , Europeâ€™s biggest listed
gambling company, said profit in the second quarter rose 18
percent, helped by lower taxes and a rebound in the Stihima
betting game.  Net income rose to 126.1 million euros ($158.5 million)
from 106.9 million euros a year earlier, according to an Athens
bourse filing today. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation
and amortization rose 4.1 percent to 160.2 million euros from
154 million euros a year earlier.  Sales slid 7.5 percent to 989.6 billion euros, hurt by
lower spending as the  Greek economy  contracted. The economy is
due to shrink about 7 percent this year, a fifth year of
recession, as austerity measures linked to the international
rescue of the country curbs pensions and wages.  Betting in June on the European Championship, the  soccer
tournament  that is held every four years, helped sales for
fixed-odds sports betting game Stihima, which rose 2.2 percent
to 370.5 million euros. The Kino numbers game saw sales fall 5.2
percent to 516.9 million euros.  To contact the reporter on this story:
