Nicaragua â€™s coffee output may trail
a government forecast after heavy rain and strong winds hurt the
crop, said Jose Angel Buitrago, the president of Excan, an
exporter group.  In the 12 months ending Sept. 30, production may be 1.53
million bags, 13 percent below a government projection in
January of 1.76 million, Buitrago said yesterday in a telephone
interview from Managua, the capital.  In the previous year, the nation collected 1.67 million
bags, each weighing 60 kilograms, or 132 pounds, according to
data from the  International Coffee Organization  in London.
Output in the year starting Oct. 1 may be little changed from
this season, Buitrago said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
