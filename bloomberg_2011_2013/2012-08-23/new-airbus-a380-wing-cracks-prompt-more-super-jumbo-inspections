Airbus SAS A380 aircraft will
require another round of inspections after European safety
officials raised concerns over wing-component cracks on the
world’s largest passenger airliner.  An inboard wing bracket has revealed signs of developing
cracks that could potentially cause a panel to detach during
flight, “possibly resulting in injury to persons on the
ground,” the European Aviation Safety Agency said today. The
Cologne, Germany-based agency requires “repetitive detailed
visual inspections” of the affected area of the wing and the
replacement or repair of the component if a fault is found.  “This is a standard airworthiness directive with no
immediate action required and is therefore nothing critical,”
Airbus spokeswoman Marcella Muratore said in an e-mail. A full
fix is due to be available next year.  Airbus is already engaged with EASA to remedy a more far-
reaching issue with cracks of a component in a different part of
the wing on its flagship aircraft. Airbus is working with EASA
to gain approval of a final repair. The company has redesigned
its wing production process to avoid the issue on new-build
A380s.  Airbus-parent  European Aeronautic, Defence & Space Co. (EAD) 
expects the total cost of dealing with the initial wing
component fault to exceed 300 million euros ($376 million), in
part because it must compensate airlines that were forced to
ground the aircraft as interim repairs were made.  EASA issued a second A380-related safety message today,
after one airline experienced jamming of a door on the upper-
deck of the double-decker airliner.  The situation “could lead to the functional loss of the
emergency exit doors of the upper deck, possibly preventing the
passengers and the flight crew from safely evacuating the
aeroplane during an emergency,” the agency said.  Airlines are being given 15 months to deal with that issue,
the agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
