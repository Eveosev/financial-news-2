Mexico ’s pension funds will probably
double their assets under management over the next five years as
the country’s economic expansion fuels job growth, according to
 BlackRock Inc. (BLK)   Money managed by pension funds, known as Afores, may reach
$300 billion by 2017 from a current $139 billion, according to
Isaac Volin, BlackRock’s Mexico country head. Assets managed by
mutual funds may also almost double over the period, Volin said.
He said the combined total managed by pension and mutual funds
could reach $500 billion in the next five to seven years.  “You see a very vibrant asset-management industry and we
see a lot of opportunities there for our business,” Volin said
in an interview at Bloomberg’s Mexico City office. “We expect
the asset management industry in Mexico to basically
duplicate.”  Volin said he expects Latin America’s second-biggest
economy to expand more than 4 percent this year after growing
3.9 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
