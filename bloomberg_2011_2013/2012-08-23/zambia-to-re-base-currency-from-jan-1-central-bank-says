Zambia  will re-base its currency
from the start of next year, lopping off three zeros from the
kwacha, which currently trades at about 4,850 per dollar, the
central bank said.  There will be a transition period up to June 30 when both
the old and new notes can be used. Banks must exchange the old
currency for the new one by the end of 2014, the Bank of Zambia
said in an e-mailed statement dated yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
