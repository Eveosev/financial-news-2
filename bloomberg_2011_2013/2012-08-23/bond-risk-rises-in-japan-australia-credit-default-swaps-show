The cost of insuring corporate bonds
from non-payment rose in Japan and  Australia , according to
credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Japan increased 2 basis points to 195
basis points as of 9:28 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices
show. The gauge is poised for its highest close since Aug. 8,
according to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  increased 1 basis point to 153
as of 11:16 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole SA prices show. The
gauge is set for a second daily rise, after a four day drop that
brought the index to its lowest level since April 4, according
to data provider CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell by 2 basis points to 146 basis
points as of 9:17 a.m. in Hong Kong, Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The index has traded between 145.8 basis
points and 159.8 basis points this month.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
