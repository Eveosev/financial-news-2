German 10-year bunds stayed higher
after a report showed the nationâ€™s services output unexpectedly
contracted in August.  The yield on the securities dropped three basis points to
1.43 percent as of 8:39 a.m. London time.  An index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in the services industry was 48.3 from 50.3 in August, London-
based Markit Economics said today. The median estimate of 25
economists in a Bloomberg News survey called for a reading of
50.1. A reading below 50 indicates contraction.  An separate manufacturing index was at 45.1, Markit said,
indicating a sixth month of contraction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
