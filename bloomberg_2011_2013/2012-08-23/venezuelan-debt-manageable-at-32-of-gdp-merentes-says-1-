Venezuela ’s national debt is
“manageable” at about 32 percent of gross domestic product,
said central bank President Nelson Merentes, adding there was no
need to devalue the bolivar at the moment.  “In the short term and for this year, we don’t think we’ll
decide to” devalue, Merentes said in an interview with
Globovision today. “You can’t inform of those decisions in
advance, anyway.”  Venezuela’s government will need to devalue the bolivar for
the third time in as many years after October elections to help
close a  budget deficit  swelled by President  Hugo Chavez ’s public
spending plans, according to a survey of analysts. The
government will weaken the official rate 31 percent to 6.2 per
dollar in the first quarter of 2013, generating more revenue in
local currency from each dollar of oil exports, according to the
median estimate of 14 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg in July.  August inflation will be similar to July’s, placing the
annual increase in prices at less than 19 percent, Merentes also
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
