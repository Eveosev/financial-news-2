Cia. Hering (HGTX3) ,  Brazil ’s second-biggest
apparel retailer, fell the most on the Bovespa after analysts at
investment bank Itau BBA cut the stock to hold from buy, citing
weaker sales.  Shares slid 4.2 percent to 43.05 reais at 1:05 p.m. in Sao
Paulo, poised for the steepest decline since June 26 on a
closing basis. The benchmark index slid 1.1 percent.  Sales at stores open at least a year fell 3.9 percent in
the second quarter from a year earlier, after a 4 percent
increase in the first quarter, because of slowing economic
growth, a decrease in consumers’ available income, bad weather
and a less appealing line of clothes for sale, Hering said in a
regulatory filing July 19.  “We just do not find enough upside potential to sustain
our long-standing outperform recommendation,” Juliana Rozenbaum, an analyst at Itau, wrote in a note to clients dated
yesterday.  The investment bank also cut  Arezzo Industria e Comercio
SA , a shoemaker and retailer, to hold from buy as the company’s
spending to open more stores and bolster its presence at other
shops may “drag down margins,” the analysts wrote.  Arezzo shares declined 2.4 percent to 33.68 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
