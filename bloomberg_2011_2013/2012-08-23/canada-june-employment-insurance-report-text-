The following is the text of
Canada’s employment insurance report for June released
by  Statistics Canada .  In June, the number of people receiving regular Employment
Insurance (EI) benefits continued its downward trend, edging
down to 507,600 from 512,100 in May. The number of beneficiaries
declined slightly in Nova Scotia and edged up in Ontario and
Prince  Edward Island .  Claims increase in June  To receive EI benefits, individuals must first submit a
claim. The number of claims provides an indication of the number
of people who could become beneficiaries.  The number of initial and renewal claims rose 3.4% to
231,600 in June, following a decline of similar magnitude in May.
Claims increased in  New Brunswick  (+8.9%),  Alberta  (+8.6%),
Quebec (+4.6%) and Manitoba (+3.3%).  Claims fell 4.6% in Prince Edward Island, while there was

following two months of declines.  Declines continue in most population centres  This release provides information on population centres
with 10,000 persons or more. EI data on population centres are
not seasonally adjusted and are therefore compared on a year-
over-year basis.  Nationally, the number of people receiving regular EI
benefits fell by 62,900 (-13.1%) between June 2011 and June 2012.
Of the 143 population centres, 123 showed declines, while 16

to 2,400, while in  Vancouver , it decreased 16.6% to 20,500.  Demographic groups  EI data by sex and age are not seasonally adjusted and are
therefore compared on a year-over-year basis.  In June, the number of people receiving regular EI benefits
fell at a similar rate for men and women in all age groups. The
rates of decline ranged between 11.2% and 13.8%.  Note to readers  The change in the number of regular Employment Insurance
(EI) beneficiaries reflects various situations, including people
becoming beneficiaries, people going back to work, and people
exhausting their regular benefits.  All data in this release are seasonally adjusted unless
otherwise specified. For more information on seasonal adjustment,
see Seasonal adjustment and identifying economic trends
( http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-010-x/2010003/part-partie3 -
eng.htm) .  EI statistics are produced from administrative data sources
provided by Service  Canada  and Human Resources and Skills
Development Canada. These statistics may, from time to time, be
affected by changes to the Employment Insurance Act or
administrative procedures. The number of regular beneficiaries
and the number of claims received for May and June are
preliminary.  The number of beneficiaries is a measure of all people who
received EI benefits from June 10 to 16. This period coincides
with the reference week of the Labour Force Survey (LFS).  EI statistics indicate the number of people who received EI
benefits, and should not be confused with data coming from the
LFS, which provides information on the total number of
unemployed people.  There is always a certain proportion of unemployed people
who do not qualify for benefits. Some unemployed people have not
contributed to the program because they have not worked in the
past 12 months or their employment is not insured. Other
unemployed people have contributed to the program but do not
meet the eligibility criteria, such as workers who left their
job voluntarily or those who did not accumulate enough hours of
work to receive benefits.
