Ghana will ship three cargoes of
Jubilee crude in October, compared with one in September, a
revised loading program obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The September plan was reduced to one cargo from two after
one lot was brought forward to end-August, according to another
revised schedule. All shipments are for 950,000 barrels.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to work
out their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
