A  Wisconsin  neurosurgeon was found
guilty of failing to tell the U.S. government about foreign bank
accounts and of filing a false 2009 federal  tax return , the U.S.
 Justice Department  said.  Arvind Ahuja was convicted yesterday by a federal court
jury in Milwaukee, the Justice Department said today in a
statement. He was first indicted in June 2011 as part of a
crackdown on offshore  tax evasion . The trial began on Aug. 15.  “According to evidence presented at trial, Ahuja
transferred millions of dollars from bank accounts in the United
States to undeclared bank accounts located in India at HSBC
bank,” the department said.  Investing those funds in certificates of deposit, Ahuja
earned more than $2.7 million in interest from 2005 through
2009, the U.S. said. He also had an undisclosed account on the
Bailiwick of Jersey, an island in the  English Channel .  The false tax return charge is punishable by as long as
three years imprisonment while the failure to file a Report of
Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts carries a top sentence of 10
years. Ahuja is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 18.  Defense attorney Dan Webb, chairman of Chicago-based
Winston & Strawn LLP, didn’t reply to an e-mailed request for
comment on the case.  The case is U.S. v. Ahuja, 11-cr-135, U.S. District Court
for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (Milwaukee).  To contact the reporter on this story:
