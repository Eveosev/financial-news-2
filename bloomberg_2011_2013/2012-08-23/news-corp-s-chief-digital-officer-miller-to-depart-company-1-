Jonathan Miller , chief digital
officer at  News Corp. (NWSA) , will leave his post as the media company
prepares to split off its publishing business.  Miller, former chief executive officer of  AOL Inc. (AOL)  who
joined the company in 2009, will leave in September, New York-
based News Corp. said today in a statement. He will serve as an
outside adviser for about a year.  Miller is leaving to start his own company, Chief Executive
Officer Rupert Murdoch said. In an e-mail, Miller said his
departure is “amicable.” News Corp. has announced several
management changes since announcing in June plans to split into
separate publishing and entertainment businesses.  At News Corp., Miller led efforts to distribute the
company’s films and TV shows through new digital outlets. He
oversaw the redesign, and sale, of MySpace and helped create The
Daily, a newspaper for the iPad.  Miller also negotiated agreements for the company to buy
stakes in Roku Inc. and  Bona Film Group (BONA) , according to the
release. He serves as a News Corp. representative on the board
of Hulu LLC, the video streaming service.  News Corp., controlled by Murdoch, fell 0.9 percent to
$23.31 at the close in New York. The Class A  stock  has gained 31
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
