Greece  may suspend civil servants
with poor disciplinary records, to hit its reform-program target
of cutting 150,000 from the public payroll by 2015,  Kathimerini 
reported, without saying how it got the information.  The plan, which might also entail suspending those who
receive poor assessments, would mean keeping employees suspended
for a year on three quarters of salary, the newspaper said. This
would replace an existing program of putting workers in a labor
reserve for three years and voluntary early retirements would
also be needed, Kathimerini said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
