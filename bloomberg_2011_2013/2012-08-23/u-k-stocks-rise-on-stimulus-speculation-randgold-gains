  U.K. stocks  were little changed as
speculation that central banks will ease monetary policy offset
a report showing the number of Americans filing applications for
 unemployment benefits  climbed last week to a one-month high.  Randgold Resources Ltd. (RRS)  and  Fresnillo Plc (FRES)  each advanced
more than 3.5 percent.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  climbed 1.7 percent as
the mining company reached an agreement to end a 10-month
dispute over a copper mine in  Chile .  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  plunged
16 percent, its biggest slump in more than 3 1/2 years.  The benchmark  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  gained 2.4 points, or less
than 0.1 percent, to 5,776.6 at the close in London, after
earlier rising as much as 0.6 percent. Stocks retreated the most
in a month yesterday, led by a selloff in mining companies, as
BHP Billiton Ltd. put $68 billion of projects on hold and Japan
reported a wider-than-estimated  trade deficit . The broader FTSE
All-Share Index also rose less than 0.1 percent today, while
Ireland’s ISEQ Index declined 0.3 percent.  “I’ve always taken the view that there is a very high
probability of QE3,” said  Robert Parker , a senior adviser at
Credit Suisse Asset Management in London, in a Bloomberg TV
interview, referring to a third round of quantitative easing.
“Politically, I think that has to be in September.”  Minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee’s July 31-
Aug. 1 meeting showed that many members decided that they would
soon need to opt for further stimulus.  “Many members judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” according
to the record of the gathering.  Jobless Claims  The number of  Americans filing applications  for
unemployment benefits climbed last week to a one-month high,
showing little progress in the labor market. Jobless claims rose
by 4,000 for a second week to reach 372,000 in the period ended
Aug. 18, a Labor Department release showed. The  median forecast 
of 41 economists surveyed by Bloomberg had called for 365,000.  In  China , a preliminary report today indicated that
manufacturing will contract at a faster pace in August,
signaling the country’s economy needs more monetary and fiscal
stimulus to secure a second-half rebound in growth.  A preliminary reading of 47.8 for a  purchasing managers’
index  released today by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
compared with July’s final 49.3 figure. If confirmed, it would
be the lowest level since November and the 10th month that the
reading has stayed below 50, the longest run in the index’s
eight-year history.  Bilateral Meetings  German Chancellor Angela Merkel hosts French President
Francois Hollande today as the leaders of Europe’s two biggest
economies seek common ground on Greece and the wider euro-area
debt crisis.  Greece’s Prime Minister, Antonis Samaras, will follow
Hollande to Berlin tomorrow and travel to Paris on Aug. 25. He
used an interview published yesterday in Bild newspaper,
Germany’s newspaper, to call for more time to carry out policy
changes to address his country’s debt woes.  Randgold Resources, a miner of the precious metal in
Africa, rose 4.2 percent to 6,400 pence as gold rallied to a 16-
week high. Fresnillo, the world’s biggest primary silver
producer, gained 3.9 percent to 1,586 pence.  Antofagasta Plc (ANTO) ,
which owns copper mines in Chile, climbed 2.9 percent to 1,152
pence. A gauge of commodity producers climbed, limiting the
 Stoxx Europe 600 Index (SXXP) ’s slide.  Anglo American added 1.7 percent to 1,941.5 pence. The
mining company will reduce its stake in its Sur unit, which owns
the Los Bronces mine in central Chile, to 50.1 percent from 75.5
percent, according to a statement today.  Vedanta Rises  Vedanta Resources Plc (VED)  advanced 1 percent to 940.5 pence.
The copper producer controlled by billionaire  Anil Agarwal  will
raise its offer to increase its stakes in Hindustan Zinc Ltd.
and Bharat Aluminium Co.  The company will ask for shareholder approval on Aug. 28 to
offer as much as 15 percent more for Hindustan Zinc, it said.
Vedanta will raise its offer for Bharat Aluminium as much as 63
percent to $550 million.  Diageo Plc (DGE)  gained 1 percent to 1,698 pence. The world’s
biggest distiller reported increased annual revenue and profit
as a recovery in demand for spirits in the U.S. and sales in
 emerging markets  help offset tough European conditions.  Earnings before interest and tax, excluding some items,
rose to 3.2 billion pounds ($5.1 billion) from 2.9 billion
pounds a year earlier, the London-based maker of Johnnie Walker
whisky said today in a statement.  WH Smith, Petropavlovsk  WH Smith Plc jumped 2.7 percent to 597.5 pence after the
U.K. magazine retailer and stationer with more than 1,000 stores
and travel shops said it plans a further share buyback of as
much as 50 million pounds.  Petropavlovsk tumbled 16 percent to 394 pence, its biggest
decline since December 2008. The producer of gold in  Russia  said
 first-half profit  fell 90 percent as interest payments and
depreciation costs rose.  Net income slumped to $11 million from $108.2 million a
year earlier, Petropavlovsk said in a statement. Interest
charges more than doubled to $34.6 million in the period and the
company took a depreciation charge of $106.9 million.  Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ)  dropped 3.4 percent to 680.5 pence. The
biggest copper producer in  Kazakhstan  said first-half profit
slumped 67 percent as volumes dropped and prices declined.  Net income shrank to $121 million, or 23 cents a share,
from $374 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier, the company
said. Sales fell 17 percent to $1.5 billion.  IMI Plc (IMI)  slipped 2.6 percent to 861 pence, dropping for a
fourth day, after the engineering company said its sales growth
will probably slow in the second half.  To contact the reporter on this story:
