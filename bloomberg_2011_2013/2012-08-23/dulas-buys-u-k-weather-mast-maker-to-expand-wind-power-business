Dulas Ltd., a provider of renewable-
energy services, bought Scottish wind-mast supplier Chillwind
Ltd. to expand its operations in the wind-power industry.  The acquisition was supported by HSBC Commercial Bank, the
lender said today in an e-mailed statement, without giving
financial details. Chillwind makes wind monitoring equipment for
mountainous areas and has been a partner of Powys, Wales-based
Dulas for the past decade, according to the statement.  The transaction is a “response to growing demand for wind
power solutions across the U.K.,” Dulas’s Chief Executive
Officer Sanjay Bowry said in the statement.  The U.K.  wants  clean energy to provide 15 percent of its
energy needs by 2020, up from about 3.8 percent now. Cumulative
installed onshore wind capacity grew 13.2 percent in the first
quarter from a year earlier, according to  data  from the
Department of Energy and Climate Change.  To contact the reporter on this story:
