Guess? Inc. (GES) , an apparel maker that
targets style-conscious 18- to 32-year-olds, sank the most in
more than a decade after cutting its annual profit and revenue
forecasts amid a drop in North American store sales.  Guess  fell  23 percent to $25.95 at the close in  New York ,
the biggest decline since November 2000. The Los Angeles-based
company’s shares have sunk 13 percent this year.  The company, which operates 511 stores in the U.S. and
 Canada , said comparable-store sales, a measure of a retailer’s
growth that excludes new stores, fell 8.5 percent in the quarter
ended July 28, according to a statement yesterday. Guess is
working to improve its women’s and accessories lines and said it
will refine its North American strategy “where necessary” to
stay competitive.  “North America retail was clearly a disappointment for
us,” Chief Executive Officer Paul Marciano said in a conference
call yesterday after the report, citing fewer tourists and
missteps in accessories. “The environment continued to be very
promotional and with less profit, especially during the second
half of the quarter. The summer months brought a sharp decrease
in visitors from  Europe  in the stores.”  Profit for the year ending Feb. 2 will be $2.15 to $2.30 a
share, the company said. In May, Guess had projected $2.50 to
$2.65 a share. Analysts anticipated $2.59, the average of 13
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  Annual revenue will be $2.62 billion to $2.65 billion, down
from a prior forecast of $2.7 billion to $2.74 billion. That
compared to an average analyst estimate of $2.71 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
