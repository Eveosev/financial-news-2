Plans by Republican  Mitt Romney  and
his running mate,  Paul Ryan , to reshape the Medicare program are
proving deeply unpopular in the swing-states of Ohio, Wisconsin
and Florida, the  New York  Times reported, citing Quinnipiac
University/New York Times/CBS News polls.  The Romney-Ryan plan calls for future beneficiaries to be
given fixed amounts of money to buy health coverage, and polls
showed Medicare to be the third most crucial issue for voters
in the three states, the NYT said.  Polling revealed about 60 percent of those questioned want
Medicare to continue providing cover for older citizens as it
does now, and see it as providing good value for money, the
newspaper reported.  Some 60 percent of independent voters in the three states
want to maintain Medicare as it is today, with 80 percent of
registered Democrats also in favor; Republican voters are
closely divided in Florida and Ohio although a majority in
Ryan’s home state of Wisconsin support the changes, the NYT
said.  Results of the polling showed Ryan’s addition to the ticket
was aiding the Romney campaign in Wisconsin and Florida, where
President  Barack Obama ’s six percentage point lead was cut back
to within the three-point margin of error in the polls, although
the president retained his 6 percentage point advantage in Ohio.  The telephone polls were conducted between Aug. 15 to Aug.
21, with 1,241 likely voters sampled in Florida, 1,253 in Ohio
and 1,190 in Wisconsin.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
