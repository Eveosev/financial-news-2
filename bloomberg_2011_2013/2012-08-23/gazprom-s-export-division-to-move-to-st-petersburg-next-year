OAO Gazprom, the world’s biggest
natural-gas producer, will move its export division to St.
Petersburg, the hometown of Russian President  Vladimir Putin ,
next year.  Gazprom Export’s head office will open in Russia’s second
city by Sept. 1,  2013, Alexander Medvedev, the head of the unit
and a deputy chief executive officer at the gas producer itself,
told reporters today in St. Petersburg.  The producer’s oil arm,  Gazprom Neft , moved its head office
to St. Petersburg from Moscow this year. The company and city
government agreed to move its planned skyscraper to the
outskirts after activists and historical preservation groups
fought the construction of what was designed as Europe’s tallest
tower near the center of Russia’s former imperial capital.  Gazprom is shifting personnel to St. Petersburg, which has
become “the gas window to Europe, thanks to  Nord Stream ,” CEO
Alexey Miller told reporters in June, referring to Russia’s
first pipeline directly to the European Union under the Baltic
Sea. Gazprom itself won’t move its headquarters from Moscow, he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
