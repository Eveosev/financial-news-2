Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the world’s biggest
drugmaker, settled a patent lawsuit over the application by
 Impax Laboratories Inc. (IPXL)  to sell a copy of the bladder-control
treatment  Detrol LA .  Terms of the accord weren’t fully disclosed in a filing
yesterday in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, referring to a
license agreement dated Aug. 16 between the two companies.
Pfizer sued Impax in 2008, claiming it infringed three patents
in applying for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to
copy its extended-release capsules.  The settlement bars Impax from selling any generic version
of the drug during the life of two of the patents “except as
permitted under the settlement and license agreement” between
the companies.  Detrol and Detrol LA generated $883 million in global sales
last year for Pfizer, including $557 million in the U.S.  “Pfizer confirms that it has settled its patent
infringement lawsuit against Impax Labs involving Pfizer’s
patents covering Detrol LA,”  Christopher Loder , a spokesman for
New York-based Pfizer, said in an e-mail. “The terms of this
agreement are confidential.”  Mark Donohue, a spokesman for Hayward, California-based
Impax, couldn’t immediately be reached for comment.  The case is Pfizer Inc. v. Impax Laboratories, 2:08-
cv-02137, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey (Newark).  To contact the reporters on this story:
