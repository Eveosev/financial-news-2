Russian  foreign direct investment 
grew 8 percent in the first half from a year earlier to $7.6
billion, with manufacturers and the financial industry receiving
the most capital.  Total foreign investment, including loans and flows into
securities markets, shrank 14.7 percent to $74.8 billion, the
Federal Statistics Service in Moscow said today in an e-mailed
statement.  The worldâ€™s biggest energy exporter is struggling to
reverse  capital outflows  that have reached $348 billion since
2007, the last full year of net inflows. President  Vladimir Putin  returned to the Kremlin in May pledging to improve the
business climate and lure foreign capital to boost investment to
25 percent of economic output by 2015 from 21 percent last year.  The financial industry received the largest amount of
investments in the first half, followed by manufacturing and
mining, according to the statistics service. Cyprus was the
largest foreign investor in the period, followed by the
Netherlands, Luxembourg, China, the U.K. and  Germany .  Capital outflow in July slowed to $3 billion to $5 billion,
Deputy Economy Minister  Andrei Klepach  was cited as saying
yesterday by Interfax.  Outflows  in the second quarter were $9.5
billion, down from $33.9 billion in the previous three months,
according to the central bank. FDI will reach between $60
billion and $70 billion soon, Putin said last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
