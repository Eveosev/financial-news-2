Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  agreed to extend
a deal to supply ore from its Sishen mine to  ArcelorMittal South
Africa Ltd. (ACL)  at below-market rates until the end of the year as
the two companies try to resolve a dispute over pricing.  Sishen Iron Ore Co. will provide a maximum of 1.5 million
metric tons to ArcelorMittal South Africa’s Newcastle and
Vanderbijlpark units at $70 a ton and Saldanha Steel at $50 a
ton through Dec. 31, Kumba said today in a statement. The 62
percent iron ore arriving at  China ’s Tianjin port, an industry
benchmark, declined 1.6 percent to $104.70 a ton yesterday.  In March 2010, Centurion, Pretoria-based Kumba canceled a
2001 agreement to supply 6.25 million tons of ore a year from
Sishen to ArcelorMittal South Africa, a unit of the world’s
largest steelmaker, at cost plus 3 percent.  Kumba, a unit of  Anglo American Plc (AAL) , said it had lapsed
because ArcelorMittal failed to renew its mining license for a
portion of the deposit, an argument rejected by the steelmaker.  An interim supply accord reached in 2010 and extended in
May last year expired on July 31. The companies are in talks on
the terms of the supply after Dec. 31, with South Africa’s
 Department of Trade and Industry  mediating.  “This supply is in settlement of ArcelorMittal South
Africa’s historic shortfall entitlement,” Kumba said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
