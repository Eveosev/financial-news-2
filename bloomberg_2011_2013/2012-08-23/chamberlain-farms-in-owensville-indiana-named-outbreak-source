 A salmonella outbreak from
cantaloupe has been linked to Chamberlain Farms in Owensville,
 Indiana , federal regulators said today.  The outbreak has sickened 178 people in 21 states,
including 62 hospitalizations, according to the FDA. Two people
in  Kentucky  have died. The agency said the farm is recalling
cantaloupe because it may be one source of possible
contamination in the outbreak.  Timothy Chamberlain, owner of the farm, declined to comment
when reached Wednesday night.  To contact the reporter on this story:
