Purchases of  new U.S. homes  rose
more than projected in July to match a two-year high, a sign the
industry that helped trigger the recession is recovering.  Sales climbed 3.6 percent to a 372,000 annual pace,
following a 359,000 rate in June that was higher than previously
estimated, figures from the Commerce Department showed today in
Washington. Last month’s rate was the same as in May, which was
the strongest since April 2010. The  median  forecast of 72
economists surveyed by Bloomberg called for a rise to 365,000.  Buyers are returning to the market to take advantage of
cheaper properties and record-low  mortgage rates , helping to
boost orders at builders like  Toll Brothers Inc. (TOL)  Competition
from foreclosures, unemployment exceeding 8 percent and limited
credit pose hurdles to a more pronounced rebound, one reason
Federal Reserve policy makers are monitoring housing data.  “The new-home market is clearly signaling a steady and
fairly strong recovery,” said  Michael Englund , chief economist
at Action Economics LLC in Boulder,  Colorado . “Demand should
continue to climb right on into 2013.”  Stocks held earlier losses after the report. The Standard &
Poor’s 500 Index fell 0.6 percent to 1,404.73 at 10:17 a.m. in
 New York .  Estimates of economists surveyed ranged from 340,000 to
400,000. June’s reading was previously reported as 350,000.  More Claims  The number of Americans filing  applications  for
 unemployment benefits  climbed last week to a one-month high,
showing little progress in the labor market, another report
today showed. Jobless claims rose by 4,000 for a second week to
reach 372,000 in the period ended Aug. 18, Labor Department
figures showed. The  median  forecast of 41 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg called for 365,000.  Sales of new houses were up 25 percent from a year ago,
today’s report from the Commerce Department showed. The median
price for a new house decreased 2.5 percent in July from the
same month last year, to $224,200.  The value of all U.S. homes climbed 1.8 percent in the
second quarter from the previous three months, the biggest gain
since late 2005, a report from the  Federal Housing Finance
Agency  also showed today.  Purchases rose in two of four regions last month, led by a
77 percent surge in the Northeast, making up for a 55 percent
plunge in June, the Commerce Department report showed. Sales
climbed 7.7 percent in the Midwest, and fell 1.6 percent in the
South and 0.9 percent in the West.  The supply of homes at the current sales rate dropped to
4.6 months from 4.8 months in June. There were 142,000 new
houses on the market at the end of July, the fewest in data
going back to 1963.  Timelier Measure  Sales of new homes, tabulated when contracts are signed,
are considered a timelier barometer than purchases of previously
owned dwellings, which are calculated when a contract closes.
Newly constructed houses accounted for 6.7 percent of the
residential market in 2011, down from a high of 15 percent
during the boom of the past decade.  Existing-home sales rose to a 4.47 million annual rate in
July from an eight-month low the prior month, the National
Association of Realtors reported yesterday. Restrictive lending
rules, a lack of inventory and lingering unemployment may be
preventing a rebound to the 5 million to 5.5 million sales pace
that the real-estate group’s said signals a “normal” market.  The NAR figures also showed distressed sales, comprised of
foreclosures and short sales, in which the lender agrees to a
transaction for less than the balance of the mortgage, accounted
for 24 percent of existing-home purchases. The share was less
than the prior month and down from 29 percent in July 2011. Of
those, 12 percent were foreclosed houses and 12 percent were
short sales.  Profits Improve  Companies benefiting from rising demand include  Bloomfield
Hills , Michigan-based  PulteGroup Inc. (PHM) , the largest U.S.
homebuilder by revenue, which posted a 32 percent jump in
second-quarter orders. Toll, the largest U.S. luxury-home
builder, yesterday reported a better-than-estimated profit and
an increase in revenue for the fiscal third-quarter.  “We are enjoying the most sustained demand we’ve
experienced in over five years,” Douglas Yearley Jr., chief
executive officer of Horsham, Pennsylvania-based Toll, said in a
statement. “Customers who have postponed buying for a number of
years are moving into the market.”  Borrowing costs continue to aid home buyers. The average
rate on a  30-year fixed  mortgage dropped to 3.49 percent in the
week ended July 26, the lowest in records dating to 1971,
according to McLean, Virginia-based  Freddie Mac .  Among other signs of improvement, residential construction
permits, a proxy for future work, jumped to a four-year high in
July. The National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo
index of builder confidence rose in August to the highest level
since 2007.  Fed officials assessed that “conditions in the housing
sector appeared to have improved somewhat, but from a very low
level,” according to minutes of the central bank’s July 31-Aug.
1 meeting released yesterday.  Many of the policy makers also said additional stimulus
would “likely be warranted fairly soon” unless the economy
shows signs of a durable pickup, according to the text.  To contact the reporters on this story:
