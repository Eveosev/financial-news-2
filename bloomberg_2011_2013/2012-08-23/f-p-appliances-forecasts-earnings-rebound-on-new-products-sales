Fisher & Paykel Appliances Holdings
Ltd. (FPA) ,  New Zealand ’s largest maker of refrigerators, forecasts
operating earnings will rebound as much as 59 percent this year
on new products and sales in  China .  Earnings before interest and tax will be between NZ$70
million ($57 million) and NZ$78 million in the year ending March
31, from NZ$49.1 million a year earlier, the Auckland-based
company said in a statement. Profit slumped 16 percent last year
because of weak demand.  F&P is developing new washing machines, refrigerators and
ovens, and is adapting its DishDrawer washer for the China
market in association with 20 percent shareholder Haier Corp.,
Chief Executive Officer Stuart Broadhurst said in notes for a
speech to shareholders today. The company is targeting as much
as 4 percent a year revenue growth from its appliances unit by
2016.  The company hasn’t paid a dividend since 2009, but intends
to resume distributions this year, it said.  The  stock  rose 0.8 percent at 66 cents at 3:40 p.m. in
Wellington trading.  F&P forecasts earnings at its appliances unit will rise to
between NZ$35 million and NZ$40 million from NZ$11.3 million
last year. Earnings for the four months ended July 31 were
NZ$9.1 million and second-half trading is usually the strongest
period, the company said.  Earnings at the finance unit, which provides loans to
consumers, will be between NZ$35 million and NZ$40 million from
NZ$37.8 million a year earlier, F&P said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
