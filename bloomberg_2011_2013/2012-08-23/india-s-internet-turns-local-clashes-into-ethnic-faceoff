One of the more tragic possibilities enabled by the information age is that incidents of discord or violence in one part of the world often have ripple effects at great removes of space, and sometimes time, and that local causes and histories are disastrously subsumed into global categories and structures. Something of this sort has been observed in  India  over the last six weeks. In July, tensions that had long simmered in Assam, a state in northeast India, between members of the Bodo tribe and Bengali-speaking Muslim immigrants, came to a boil  in a surge of violence , claiming many lives and displacing thousands. It was lamentable that this crisis did not receive as much attention in the national media as it should have, but the fallout of the violence across the country was just as disturbing. Bit by bit, a regional dispute with  a long and complex history  involving local political parties, illegal immigration and movement patterns of settlement over decades, was turned,  on Internet forums  and through  text messages , into a Hindu-Muslim faceoff, with all the absence of specificity and projection of stereotypes  common to this kind of debate . Earlier this month, a rally was held in Mumbai, more than 1,500 miles west of the Assam violence, to protest the attacks on Muslims in Assam. Fuelled by  doctored videos  of violence against Muslims, the protest  turned bloody , leaving two people dead and over 100 injured. A few days later, rumors fanned out in Bangalore, again more than 1,500 miles south of Assam, that the city's sizeable class of migrants from northeast India might be under attack by Muslims. A vicious  campaign of threats over text message  led thousands of northeastern migrants to  flee the city , in a disturbing echo of the many thousands displaced in Assam. On Wednesday, the Indian Express  reported   that preliminary investigations revealed that one miscreant in Bangalore, a cellphone repairman, had forwarded inflammatory images and messages to about 20,000 people. At the heart of this violence was the continuing chasm of understanding that lies between what is called "mainland India" and the seven states of its northeast, which have historically received stepmotherly treatment from  New Delhi  and  found their citizens handled like aliens  when they travel to other parts of their own country.  As Sanjoy Hazarika wrote in the Hindustan Times  on Aug. 19, this ignorance led to thousands of people from the northeast becoming scapegoats: Indeed, most Indians cannot break down the many internal histories and differences of this region beyond a generic "northeast" -- a marker useful as a starting-point perhaps, but not as an end. This ignorance opens out into a pervasive and unselfconscious racism. As the playwright and theatre director Swar Thounaojam, a native of Manipur in the northeast who now lives in Bangalore in the south,  wrote  a few months ago in the Economic & Political Weekly: Through modern technology, such racial stereotypes can travel a long way.  On the website Firstpost.com , Nishant Shah, a well-known Indian writer on the intersection of technology and society and a native of Bangalore, painted a dystopian picture of a networked world gone wrong: But amid all the turmoil, what is perhaps the most disturbing is just how vulnerable people from the northeast feel within their own nation. As  an Aug. 18 editorial in the Indian Express  correctly observed: Meanwhile, back in Assam, thousands of people displaced by the original commotion -- the clashes that allowed groups with different ideological convictions to invent or inflame further violence, sometimes with the creative narrative use of modern technology -- are  just beginning to return home  from the relief camps in which they have for weeks been forced to seek refuge.
