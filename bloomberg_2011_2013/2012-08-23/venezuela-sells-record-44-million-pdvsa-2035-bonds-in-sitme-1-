Venezuela ’s central bank sold $44
million of bonds due 2035 from Petroleos de Venezuela SA through
its currency market known as Sitme today, the biggest one-day
sale of the 9.75 percent bonds since they were issued.  The yield on the state oil company’s bonds rose 3 basis
points, or 0.03 percentage point to 12.66 percent at 2:15 p.m.
in Caracas, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price
fell 0.18 cent to 78.37 cents on the dollar.  Of the $3 billion of the PDVSA bonds maturing in 2035 sold
to the central bank and state-run banks in May, $108.5 million
of the securities have now been sold in Sitme to investors
abroad, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. There was $57.9
million of bonds traded today in the central bank’s  currency
market .  “No one was expecting this much supply today,” Andres Caballero, a bond trader at BancTrust & Co. in Caracas, said in
an e-mailed response to questions. “There has been appetite for
this bond, but obviously the supply was larger than demand and
that’s why it fell.”  PDVSA bonds were the most actively traded dollar-
denominated corporate securities by dealers today as of 2:15
p.m., with 110 trades of $1 million or more of the state-oil
company’s debt, according to Trace, the bond-price reporting
system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. Of those
110 trades, 15 were of the PDVSA 2035 bonds.  The central bank and Venezuelan commercial banks trade
government and PDVSA bonds in Sitme as a way to provide dollars
to importers who can’t get foreign exchange at the official rate
of 4.3 bolivars per dollar because of currency controls.
Venezuelans pay for the bonds in bolivars at a fixed rate of 5.3
per dollar and receive foreign currency in return when the
securities are sold to investors abroad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
