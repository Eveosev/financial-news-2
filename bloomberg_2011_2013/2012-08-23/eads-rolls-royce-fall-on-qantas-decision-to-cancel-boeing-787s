European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. and  Rolls-Royce Holdings Plc (RR/)  dropped after  Qantas Airways
Ltd. (QAN)  canceled an order for  Boeing Co. (BA)  787-9 airliners, raising
concern that other carriers will also cut back.  EADS, the parent company of Airbus SAS, fell as much as 59
cents, or 1.9 percent, to 30.05 euros in Paris, the most in 10
days. Rolls-Royce, among the makers of engines for the 787
Dreamliner, declined as much as 6.6 pence, or 0.8 percent, to
833 pence in London.  “We are braced for more airlines to enter cash
conservation mode over the next few months,”  Sandy Morris , an
analyst at Jefferies International said in an investor note.
“Everything is up for grabs,” he said, with airlines having
already scaled back expenditure on spare parts.  Qantas said today that it is canceling an order for 35
787-9s worth $8.5 billion at list price on “lower growth
requirements.” The aircraft were to be powered by  General
Electric Co. (GE)  GEnx engines. Qantas previously delayed deliveries
of Rolls-Royce Trent 900-powered A380s made by Airbus.  The Qantas move “could have a negative impact on investor
sentiment towards Boeing and its suppliers,” Robert Stallard a
London-based analyst for RBC Capital Markets said. However, the
Qantas move is not indicative of a global trend, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
