American incomes declined more in
the three-year expansion that started in June 2009 than during
the longest recession since the Great Depression, according an
analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data by Sentier Research LLC.  Median  household income  fell 4.8 percent on an inflation-
adjusted basis since the recession ended in June 2009, more than
the 2.6 percent drop during the 18-month contraction, the
research firm’s Gordon Green and John Coder wrote in a report
today. Household income is 7.2 percent below the December 2007
level, the former Census Bureau economic statisticians wrote.  “Almost every group is worse off than it was three years
ago, and some groups had very large declines in income,” Green,
who previously directed work on the Census Bureau’s income and
poverty statistics program, said in a phone interview today.
“We’re in an unprecedented period of economic stagnation.”  While gains in hourly earnings and average hours worked per
week may have had “a minor mitigating effect” on income
declines, they couldn’t offset a jobless rate that hasn’t fallen
below 8 percent since February 2009 and a record duration of
unemployment, according to the Annapolis, Maryland-based firm.  The average duration of unemployment increased to a record
41 weeks in November and remains at  39 weeks , Labor Department
data show. Almost  5.2 million  Americans have been out of work
for at least six months.  Earnings Drop  Real median annual household income fell to $53,508 from
$54,916 during the 18-month recession from December 2007 to June
2009, according to the firm’s study of income data for the 36-
month period ended in June 2012. Incomes kept falling during the
36-month period since then, dropping to $50,964 in June 2012.  Men living alone experienced the worst drop in income,
losing 9.4 percent, while married couples fared best with a 3.6
percent decline, the report shows. Incomes are before tax and
adjusted for changes in consumer prices and expressed in
constant June 2012 dollars.  “Median annual household income declined significantly for
both family and non-family households,” Green and Coder wrote.
“Real median annual household income declined more
significantly for younger households.”  Incomes for all age groups below 65 years fell, while older
Americans saw increases. Incomes for those 55 to 64 fell the
most, losing 9.7 percent, followed by the 8.9 percent decline
for 25- to 34-year-olds. The two gains were among those 65 to
75, whose incomes rose 6.5 percent, and those 75 and up who
experienced an increase of 2.8 percent.  By education, Americans with some college lost the most,
with incomes falling 9.3 percent, followed by an 8.6 percent
slump for those with associate degrees, the report said. Those
without high school degrees lost the least, falling 5.3 percent.  Green is a former chief of the governments division at the
Census Bureau, the report said. Coder was chief of the Income
Statistics Branch at the bureau, where he oversaw collection and
processing of income data and developed new survey methods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
