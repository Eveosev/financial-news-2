Ethanol futures fell the most in
more than a week in Chicago as production costs eased with
cheaper corn.  Prices followed the grain lower after a Professional Farmer
Crop Tour analysis showed average yields in Illinois, the
second-biggest U.S. grower after  Iowa , may average 121.6 bushels
an acre, more than the 116 bushels the Agriculture Department
estimated on Aug. 10, tempering manufacturing costs for ethanol
distilleries that use the grain to make the biofuel.  “It has to follow corn, it’s the number one input,” said
 Jason Ward , an analyst at Northstar Commodity Investments LLC in
 Minneapolis .  Denatured ethanol for September delivery fell 3.6 cents, or
1.4 percent, to settle at $2.628 a gallon on the Chicago Board
of Trade, the biggest decline since Aug. 13. The futures have
gained 19 percent this year.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  sank 5 cents to
$2.68 a gallon and fell in Chicago 2 cents to $2.615.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf dropped 2 cents to $2.675, while
falling 3 cents to $2.76 a gallon on the West Coast, data
compiled by Bloomberg as of 4:40 p.m. shows.  Corn for December delivery declined 20 cents, or 2.4
percent, to $8.1475 a bushel in  Chicago . One bushel makes at
least 2.75 gallons of the renewable fuel.  The value of Renewable Identification Numbers, known as
RINs, rose 2.7 percent to 3.75 cents, data compiled by Bloomberg
show. They are credits that help the government track whether
refiners are meeting 2012 federal ethanol use mandates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
