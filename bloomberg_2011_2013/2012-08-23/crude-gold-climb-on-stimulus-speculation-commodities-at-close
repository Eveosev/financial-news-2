percent, to $691 a metric ton, PVM data showed.  BASE METALS  Copper climbed to the highest level in more than a month on

world’s two largest users, may announce more stimulus to revive

a bushel on Aug. 10. Wheat  for December delivery dropped 0.3
percent to $9.1475 a bushel.  Rubber climbed on speculation that central banks in the
U.S. and China may add stimulus to bolster growth, supporting
demand for the commodity used in tires.  The January-delivery contract rose as much as 1.6 percent
to 222 yen a kilogram ($2,827 a metric ton) before ending at
220.3 yen on the Tokyo Commodity Exchange. That pared this
year’s decline to 16 percent.  Palm oil  climbed for a fifth day to the highest in more
than five weeks after soybeans rose to a record as a U.S. crop
