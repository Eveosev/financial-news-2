Kazakhmys Plc (KAZ) , the biggest copper
producer in  Kazakhstan , said first-half profit slumped 67
percent as volumes dropped and prices declined.  Net income shrank to $121 million, or 23 cents a share,
from $374 million, or 70 cents, a year earlier, the London-based
company said today in a statement. Sales fell 17 percent to $1.5
billion. Kazakhmys declared a dividend of 3 cents a share.  The company expects higher sales in the second half and
sees “sound” copper prices, it said, maintaining its full-year
output forecast at 285,000 metric tons to 295,000 tons of the
metal. The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange averaged
14 percent lower in the period.  “Uncertainty prevails in the global markets, but we are
encouraged by the continuing demand from our customers,” Chief
Executive Officer Oleg Novachuk said in the statement. “With
the growth projects moving closer to production and a sound
balance sheet, the longer-term outlook also remains positive.”  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization dropped to $949 million from $1.6 billion a year
earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
