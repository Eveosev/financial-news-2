China Unicom (Hong Kong) Ltd. (762) , the
nation’s second-largest mobile-phone company, posted second-
quarter profit that beat analysts’ estimates as a range of cheap
handsets capped the cost of luring smartphone users.  Net income  fell 2 percent to 2.42 billion  yuan  ($381
million), from a restated 2.47 billion yuan a year earlier,
based on figures derived from half-year earnings the Beijing-
based company reported today. That compares with the 2.1
billion-yuan median of five analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg
News survey.  Chairman Chang Xiaobing has turned to cheaper smartphones
from Chinese suppliers  Lenovo Group Ltd. (992) ,  ZTE Corp. (000063)  and Huawei
Technologies Co. to trim subsidy costs and reduce reliance on
 Apple Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone to win new users. Unicom lost exclusivity to
offer the iPhone with a service plan in the nation when  China
Telecom Corp. (728)  began selling the device March 9.  “China Unicom reported strong first-half net profit,”
Alen Lin, an analyst at BNP Paribas Securities  Asia  in  Hong
Kong , said in an e-mail. “We upgraded the stock to a buy at the
end of May arguing that the declining subsidy expense ratio
would translate into strong profit growth.”  Revenue rose 15 percent to 60.5 billion yuan in the second
quarter, beating the median estimate of 60.4 billion yuan in the
Bloomberg News survey.  Unicom rose 4 percent to close at HK$13.02 in Hong Kong
 trading  before the announcement. The shares have fallen 20
percent this year, compared with an 9.2 percent gain for the
city’s  Hang Seng Index .  Handset Subsidies  Handset subsidies in the first half were 3.52 billion yuan,
compared with 3.06 billion a year earlier, the company said
today. Those subsidies helped the company add 17.5 million 3G
users in the period, the company said.  “It looks like the earnings were better than expected
because they had lower expenses than people expected as they
controlled the handset subsidies,” Michael Meng, a Hong Kong-
based analyst with BOCI Research Ltd., said in a phone interview
today.  The amount of handset subsidies will increase in the second
half, while the subsidies as a proportion of sales will fall,
President Lu Yimin said at a press conference in Hong Kong
today.  Unicom had 57.5 million 3G subscribers at the end of the
second quarter, lagging behind the 67.1 million for market-
leader  China Mobile Ltd. (941) , according to data the companies
released last month. The smaller operator had a total mobile
customer base of 219.3 million, or 32 percent of China Mobile’s
683.1 million.  Rivals’ Earnings  China Mobile on Aug. 16 posted second-quarter  net income 
that was little changed at 34.4 billion yuan, missing analysts’
estimate of 35.6 billion yuan. The company said costs to
subsidize handsets will total 26 billion yuan this year, 30
percent more than it previously projected.  China Telecom’s second-quarter  net income  fell 10 percent
to 4.55 billion yuan, the company reported yesterday. Profit
beat analysts’ estimate of 4.4 billion yuan as the introduction
of the iPhone lured new customers.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
