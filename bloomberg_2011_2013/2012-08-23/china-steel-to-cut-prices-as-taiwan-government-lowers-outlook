China Steel Corp.,   Taiwan ’s largest
producer of the alloy, will cut prices for local customers after
the government lowered its economic growth forecast for the year
amid slowing output by manufacturers, including automakers.  Prices will fall by an average 5.1 percent for October and
November contracts, the Kaohsiung-based company said today in an
e-mailed statement. Prices of hot-rolled coil, a benchmark
product, will fall by an average NT$806 ($27) a metric ton for
October and November.  The cut will be the biggest since the 7 percent reduction
for January and February contracts announced on Nov. 24. Taiwan
cut its growth forecast for 2012 this month after the economy
shrank more than estimated last quarter, as weakening global
demand hurt exports.  China Steel fell 0.6 percent to NT$26.35 at the close in
Taipei before the announcement. The  stock  has dropped 7.1
percent this year compared with a 6.1 percent gain in the
benchmark Taiex index.  Output by manufacturers fell 0.2 percent in the second
quarter, while investments in the transportation vehicle
industry declined 4.48 percent, the statistics bureau said in a
statement on Aug. 17.  Prices of plates will be reduced by an average NT$1,157 a
ton, bar and wire rods by NT$1,800 and cold-rolled steel by
NT$959, according to the statement. It will cut electro-
galvanized sheet prices by NT$800 a ton, electrical sheets by
NT$1,050 and hot-dipped zinc-galvanized sheets by NT$1,216.  The percentage changes for the various types of products
weren’t mentioned in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
