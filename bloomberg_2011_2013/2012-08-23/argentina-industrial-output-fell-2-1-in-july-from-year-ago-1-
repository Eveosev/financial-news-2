Argentine  industrial production  fell
in July for a fourth straight month, the longest decline since
2009 as factories crimped output on lower demand from
neighboring Brazil.  Last month’s 2.1 percent contraction was slower than June’s
4.7 percent decline, the National Statistics Institute said
today. Production rose 1.4 percent from June, the first monthly
increase this year, the agency said.  South America’s second-biggest economy will grow 2.2
percent this year after expanding 8.9 percent in 2011, according
to the  World Bank . Lower demand from Brazil, the country’s main
trade partner, prompted automakers to cut exports 38.4 percent
in July from a year earlier.  The government of President  Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 
tightened import restrictions this year in a bid to protect
local producers from competition from foreign goods and prevent
the country’s  trade surplus  from narrowing. The government will
continue to stimulate domestic consumption to ensure growth,
