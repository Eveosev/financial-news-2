Canadian Auto Workers President  Ken Lewenza  says that  Ford Motor Co. (F) ,  General Motors Co. (GM)  and
Chrysler Group LLC can afford to sign new labor contracts
without work stoppages if they scale back demands for union
concessions.  The CAW hasn’t decided whether to focus negotiations with
one company first or try to sign contracts with all three at the
same time, Lewenza said today in a telephone interview from
Toronto.  “We need to get a deal without a work stoppage,” Lewenza
said. “There is a little bit of enthusiasm now, in the
turnaround at GM and Chrysler; obviously Ford has never been
more profitable. So let’s keep that momentum, that’s the message
I’m going to send.”  One obstacle is the Canadian dollar’s rise against the U.S.
dollar of 58 percent in the last decade. Ford estimates that it
spends $79 for every hour of work in Canadian plants, when
including costs for benefits and retirees, compared with $64 an
hour in the U.S., $48 in  Germany  and $35 in  Australia .  Lewenza said the automaker demands in this round of
negotiations are about the toughest he has seen in a 35-year
career.  “It’s way too premature to see if one of those three
companies are going to decide not to fight or all three
companies are going to decide to fight together,” he said.
“The most important issue is getting a deal actually with all
three companies at the same time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
