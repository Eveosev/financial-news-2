Tiger Woods shot an opening-round 68
and is four strokes behind leader Padraig Harrington at the U.S.
PGA Tour’s Barclays tournament at the Bethpage Black course in
Farmingdale, New York.  Woods, playing in a group with PGA Championship winner Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland, had four birdies and one bogey to
finish at 3-under par. McIlroy shot a 2-under-par 69.  Harrington was 6-under on the final nine holes, including
four consecutive birdies, for an opening-round 64. Winner of the
British Open and the PGA in 2008, he and McIlroy are the only
multiple-time winners in the last 22 major golf tournaments.  Americans  Nick Watney  and Brian Harman trail Harrington by
one stroke. Gary Christian of England bogeyed the 18th hole to
fall to 5-under par, tied with  Sergio Garcia  and Pat Perez two
strokes behind the leader.  The Barclays tournament is the first in the four-event
FedExCup playoff, which features a $10 million bonus for the
champion. The field will be trimmed to the top 100 golfers in
the point standings heading into next week’s event.  Woods and McIlroy were the tournament’s co-favorites
heading into play today, with 8-1 odds to win. Woods won the
first PGA tour event held at the Bethpage State Park course, the
2002  U.S. Open .  Lucas Glover , who isn’t in the field this week,
won when the Open returned in 2009.  Phil Mickelson , often a crowd favorite on Long Island, is
tied with Woods at 3-under.  To contact the reporter on this story:
