Fourteen Nordic nuclear reactors run
by Vattenfall AB, EON AG,  Fortum Oyj (FUM1V)  and Teollisuuden Voima Oyj
are producing at a combined capacity of 62 percent, unchanged
from yesterday, according to data from company websites and
calculations by Bloomberg.  Forsmark-1, Oskarshamn-1, Oskarshamn-3 and Ringhals-4 in
 Sweden  and Loviisa-1 in  Finland  are out of service for
maintenance or repairs. The remaining nine are online.  EON AG,  Germany ’s biggest utility, plans to start its
1,400-megawatt Oskarshamn-3 nuclear reactor in Sweden tonight,
it said yesterday in a filing to the Nord Pool Spot AS exchange
in Oslo. Power output will increase to full capacity during the
first 55 hours, after which time an interrupted test period will
continue, it said.  The table below lists all units and their utilization rates
based on latest available data. It shows current output and
installed capacity in megawatts and utilization in percent.  
*Data for Loviisa reactors were not available on Fortum’s
website. Figures are an estimate based on real-time production
from transmission system operator Fingrid Oyj.  To contact the reporter on this story:
