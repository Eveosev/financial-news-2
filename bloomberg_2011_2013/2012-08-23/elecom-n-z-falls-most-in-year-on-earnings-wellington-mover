Telecom Corp. of New Zealand , the
nation’s largest provider of Internet connections, fell the most
in more than 3 1/2 years after saying earnings may decline as
more competition weighs on prices.  Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization will be flat to a low single-digit percentage
decline in the year ending June 30, 2013, the Auckland-based
company said in a statement today. The shares fell 8.5 percent,
their biggest daily decline since Oct. 16, 2008.  Telecom last year split from its Chorus network unit, and
operates as a provider of telecommunication services as well as
being  New Zealand ’s second-biggest mobile phone company. It
faces growing competition as  Vodafone Group Plc (VOD)  and Telstra
Corp. plan to merge their New Zealand units.  “Telecom’s operational performance reflects an
increasingly competitive market,” Chris Quin, who acted as
chief executive officer after  Paul Reynolds  stepped down June 1,
said in the statement. “We expect strong competition to
continue with increasing consolidation.”  Replacement chief executive Simon Moutter took over on Aug.
13.  Telecom shares fell 23.5 cents to NZ$2.52 at the 5 p.m.
market close in Wellington trading.  Operating earnings were NZ$1.05 billion ($853 million) in
the 12 months ended June 30, the company said. Full-year net
income was NZ$1.16 billion including five months of Chorus
trading before the split. Profit from continuing operations was
NZ$422 million, up 8.8 percent from a year earlier.  Second-half profit from continuing operations was NZ$182
million. In June, the company said profit would be near the top
of a NZ$160 million to NZ$190 million range.  To contact the reporter on this story:
