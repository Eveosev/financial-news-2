New World Resources Plc (NWR)  jumped the
most in almost a month after second-quarter profit at the
biggest Czech producer of coking coal shrank less than analysts
expected.  The stock climbed 2.1 percent, its steepest gain since July
24, to 97 koruna by the close in Prague, making it the second-
best performer in the 14-member  PX (PX)  equity index today.  Net income for April to June contracted 66 percent from a
year earlier to 28.3 million euros ($35.5 million) as falling
demand from steelmakers lowered prices of the commodity, the
company said today. That compares with the 24.8 million-euro
mean estimate of eight analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. The costs
of material, energy, services and personnel shrank 7.4 percent
and financial expenses fell 39 percent, according to the
earnings statement.  “Figures for the second quarter are significantly better
than expected,”  Josef Nemy , an analyst at  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)  in
Prague, wrote in a report to clients today. “Lower-than-
expected operating and financial costs will have a positive
impact on our full-year forecasts.”  Basic resources stocks were among the biggest gainers in
Europe as commodities advanced on speculation central banks in
the U.S. and China will take steps to stimulate growth in the
world’s two largest economies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
