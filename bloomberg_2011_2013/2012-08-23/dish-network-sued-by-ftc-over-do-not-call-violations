Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  was sued by the
U.S. Federal Trade Commission and accused of violating the
agency’s National Do Not Call Registry in its telemarketing
operations.  The FTC said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court
in Springfield, Illinois, that the second-largest U.S.
satellite-television provider illegally called millions of
consumers who asked its telemarketers or its affiliates not to
call them again.  “We have vigorously enforced the  Do Not Call  rules and
will continue to do so to protect consumers’ right to be left
alone in the privacy of their own homes,” FTC Chairman  Jon Leibowitz  said in a statement.  Leibowitz said it was “particularly disappointing when a
well-established, nationally known company -- which ought to
know better -- appears to have flagrantly and illegally made
millions of invasive calls to Americans who specifically told
 Dish Network  to leave them alone.”  Dish said in an e-mailed statement that it disputed the
FTC’s allegations, saying its marketing practices reflect
“best-in-class standards” and have been certified by an
independent third-party expert after a thorough review.  “We vigorously will defend ourselves against the claims,”
 John Hall , a spokesman for Englewood, Colorado-based Dish, said
in the statement.  DirecTV (DTV) , based in El Segundo, California, is the largest
satellite TV provider.  The case is Federal Trade Commission v. Dish Network LLC,
3:12-cv-03221, U.S. District Court, Central District of Illinois
(Springfield).  To contact the reporter on this story:
