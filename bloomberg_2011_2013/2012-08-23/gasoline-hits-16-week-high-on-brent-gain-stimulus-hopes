Gasoline advanced to a 16-week high
as  Brent crude  strengthened and a rise in U.S. jobless claims
fueled speculation that the  Federal Reserve  will move to
stimulate economic growth.  Futures climbed as Brent, which underpins the price of
imported crude and gasoline, gained versus West Texas
Intermediate oil. Weekly  applications  for  unemployment benefits 
increased to a one-month high, a Labor Department report showed.
The minutes from the most recent Federal Reserve meeting
indicated policy makers are supportive of more easing soon.  “Brent is moving higher,” said  Gene McGillian , an analyst
and broker at Tradition Energy in Stamford, Connecticut.
“Disappointing economic numbers seem to reinforce the idea that
more stimulus is coming.”  September-delivery gasoline rose 1.83 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $3.1225 a gallon at 10:03 a.m. on the  New York

intraday level for the front-month contract since April 30. The
more actively traded October contract gained 2.13 cents to
$2.9595.  Brent’s premium to WTI widened to 65 cents to $18.30 a
barrel. Brent for October settlement advanced 93 cents to
$115.84 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  Jobless claims increased by 4,000 to 372,000 in the period
ended Aug. 18, Labor Department figures showed.  Federal Reserve  Many Fed members “judged that additional monetary
accommodation would likely be warranted fairly soon unless
incoming information pointed to a substantial and sustainable
strengthening in the pace of the economic recovery,” according
to the record of the Fed’s July 31-Aug. 1 gathering released
yesterday in Washington.  The  Federal Open Market Committee , the Fed’s policy-making
arm, next meets on Sept. 12-13.  Heating oil for September delivery rose 1.92 cents, or 0.6

cents to $3.1557.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.2
