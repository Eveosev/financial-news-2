Spanish 10-year bonds declined,
pushing the extra yield investors demand to hold the securities
instead of similar-maturity German bunds to more than 500 basis
points.  The spread increased 19 basis points to 500 basis points,
or 5 percentage points, as of 9:37 a.m. London time, the widest
since Aug. 17. The Spanish 10-year yield was 13 basis points
higher at 6.41 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
