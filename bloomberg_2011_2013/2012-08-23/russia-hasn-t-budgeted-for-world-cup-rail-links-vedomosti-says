The Russian government hasn’t
included in a budget any plans for the 2013-2015 expenditure on
the high-speed rail links that the Kremlin pledged to build for
the 2018 World Cup,  Vedomosti  reported, citing unidentified
officials.  Spending on Moscow-Yekaterinburg and Moscow-St. Petersburg
high-speed rail links, estimated at about 3.3 trillion rubles
($103.4 billion), isn’t included in the 5.6 trillion rubles
investment program up until 2020 of state monopoly OAO Russian
Railways, the newspaper reported.  Some 70 percent of the project should have been financed by
the state, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
