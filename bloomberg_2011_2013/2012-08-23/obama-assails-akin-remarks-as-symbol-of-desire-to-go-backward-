President  Barack Obama  told donors
at a fundraising event that comments on rape and abortion by
Todd Akin, the Republican U.S. Senate candidate in Missouri,
represent a “desire to go backward instead of forward.”  “The interesting thing here is this is an individual who
sits on the House Committee on Science and Technology but
somehow missed science class,” Obama told an audience at a
dinner in  New York  tonight. “It’s representative of the desire
to go backward instead of forward and the fights that we thought
were settled 20, 30 years ago.”  Akin, a six-term congressman seeking to defeat Democratic
incumbent Senator  Claire McCaskill , said during an Aug. 19
interview that “legitimate rape” rarely leads to pregnancy.
The remark spurred Republican leaders, including the party’s
presumed presidential nominee  Mitt Romney , to call for Akin to
end his candidacy.  Akin, who later apologized for his comment, said yesterday
that he will stay in the race.   Obama made a rare, impromptu appearance Aug. 20 at the
daily White House reporters’ briefing and castigated Akin,
calling the remarks “offensive” and “way out there.”      To contact the reporter on this story:
