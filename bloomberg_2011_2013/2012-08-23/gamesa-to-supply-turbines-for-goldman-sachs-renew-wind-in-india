Gamesa Corporacion Tecnologica SA (GAM) 
won a 74.65-megawatt wind turbine order in  India  from Goldman
Sachs Group Inc.-backed ReNew Wind Power Pvt. Ltd.  Gamesa will supply and commission 50 megawatts of G97 2-
megawatt models and 24.65 megawatts of G58 850-kilowatt machines
for installation in Maharashtra, the Zamudio, Spain-based
company said today in a statement without disclosing terms.  The order, Gamesa’s first with Gurgaon-based ReNew Wind,
follows efforts by  Spain ’s biggest turbine-maker to boost sales
to India, the world’s third-largest wind market. Gamesa expects
to complete installation this year, according to the statement.  Goldman Sachs  made  an equity investment of about 10 billion
rupees ($181 million) in ReNew Wind in September last year.
ReNew Wind plans to operate 1,000 megawatts of wind by 2015.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
