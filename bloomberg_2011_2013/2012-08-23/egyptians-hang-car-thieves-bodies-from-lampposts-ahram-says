Residents of a village in the
Egyptian governorate of Sharqiya chased, killed and strung up on
lampposts four men who tried to steal a car at gunpoint, the
state-run  Ahram Gate  reported today.  Two of the four, who authorities say are registered
offenders, were killed in the village late yesterday, and the
others were captured by a mob of hundreds and killed in nearby
fields, the website said, citing security officials in the area.  It was the sixth such case of vigilante hangings in the
region since the ouster of  Hosni Mubarak , the website said. Last
year’s uprising, during which police withdrew from the streets,
created a security vacuum that has yet to be fully reversed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
