A plan by the Hungarian government
to introduce a pre-election voter registration system is a
“technical” matter and doesn’t infringe citizens’ right to
vote, Lajos Kosa, the ruling Fidesz party’s deputy chairman,
said in an interview with weekly magazine  Heti Valasz .  Kosa rejected criticism that the system would be
unconstitutional, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
