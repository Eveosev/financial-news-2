  Brazil  increased the availability
of a special  credit line  to corn growers as the government seeks
to encourage planting amid competition from soybeans, Deputy
Economic Policy Secretary Joao Rabelo said today.  Brazil is concerned that a poor output in the summer corn
season, which competes directly with soy for acres, may drive up
prices, damaging pork and poultry producers that use feed made
from the grain, he said.  “Corn is at a price that makes it very attractive for
growers now,” Rabelo told reporters today in Brasilia. “The
reality is that soybean is way more profitable for farmers,” he
said.  Farmers will have access to as much as $395,000 in credit
at below-market  interest rates  to cover the costs of producing
corn, up from $247,000 previously, Rabelo said.  Corn prices have increased 26 percent this year, while
soybean has climbed 42 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
