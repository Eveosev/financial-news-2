Polskie Gornictwo Naftowe i
Gazownictwo SA  headed for the steepest decline in three months
after  Poland ’s dominant natural-gas company posted an unexpected
second-quarter loss.  The shares dropped as much as 3.4 percent before trading
2.9 percent lower at 4.03 zloty, the most on a closing basis
since May 25, as of 10:08 a.m. in Warsaw.  Net loss widened to 314 million zloty ($97 million) from 20
million zloty a year earlier, PGNiG, as the company is known,
said on its website today. That compares with the 3.4 million-
zloty mean estimate of a profit from eight analysts surveyed by
Bloomberg.  “PGNiG has had a truly disappointing quarter,” Robert Rethy, a Prague-based analyst at Wood&Co., wrote in a note to
clients today. “The source of the miss is entirely the trading
segment.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
