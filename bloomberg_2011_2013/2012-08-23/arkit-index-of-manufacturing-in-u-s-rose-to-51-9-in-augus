The Markit Economics preliminary
 index  of U.S. manufacturing increased to 51.9 in August from
51.4 a month earlier, the London-based group said today.  A reading above 50 in the purchasing managers’ measure
indicates expansion. The median forecast in a Bloomberg News
survey of economists was 51.5. Estimates ranged from 50 to 52.  A slump in  Europe  and slower growth in  China  threaten to
limit demand for American-made goods. In the U.S., joblessness
above 8 percent is restraining  consumer spending , which accounts
for about 70 percent of the economy.  A Labor Department report today showed the number of
Americans filing  first-time claims  for  unemployment benefits 
climbed last week to a one-month high. Jobless claims rose by
4,000 to 372,000 in the period ended Aug. 18.  China’s manufacturing may be contracting at a faster pace
this month, another report showed. A preliminary reading of 47.8
for a purchasing managers’ index released today by HSBC Holdings
Plc and Markit compares with July’s final 49.3 figure. If
confirmed, it would be the lowest level since November and the
10th month that the reading has been below 50, the longest run
in the index’s eight- year history.  Euro-area services and manufacturing output contracted for
a seventh straight month in August, adding to signs of a
deepening economic slump as European leaders struggle to contain
the fiscal crisis.  A composite index based on a survey of purchasing managers
in both industries in the 17-nation euro area was little changed
at 46.6 after 46.5 in July, Markit said today in an initial
estimate.  Regional Reports  Regional U.S. manufacturing data for August show the
industry is struggling. The Federal Reserve Bank of  New York ’s
general economic index fell to minus 5.9 this month from 7.4 in
July, contracting for the first time in 10 months. The Federal
Reserve Bank of Philadelphia’s economic  index  was minus 7.1, the
fourth consecutive month of contraction, after minus 12.9 in
July.  Markit’s preliminary purchasers figure is based on replies
from about 85 percent to 90 percent of those American
manufacturers who respond to the poll of the more than 600
companies surveyed.  The gauge of U.S. manufacturing debuted in May. The company
surveys purchasing managers in more than 30 countries and
regions, including Europe and China.  To contact the reporter on this story:
