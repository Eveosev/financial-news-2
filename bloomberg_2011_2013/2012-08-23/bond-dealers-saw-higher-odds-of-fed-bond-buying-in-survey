Primary dealers saw a higher
probability of Federal Reserve asset purchases in a survey
conducted by the central bank in July, before its most recent
policy meeting.  The median respondent in the survey by the  Federal Reserve
Bank of New York  saw a 65 percent chance the Fed would expand
its balance sheet through securities purchases within one year,
up from 50 percent odds in the survey conducted before the
 Federal Open Market Committee â€™s June 19-20 meeting, results
released today by the  New York  Fed showed.  Fed officials said in an Aug. 1 statement that they will
step up record stimulus if needed to spur growth and cut a
jobless rate stuck above 8 percent since February 2009. Many
policy makers said additional stimulus probably will be needed
soon unless the economy shows signs of a durable pickup, minutes
from the meeting showed yesterday in  Washington .  Bond dealers in the survey pushed back their expectations
for the Fed to raise its  benchmark interest rate . The median
among the predictions for the timing of the first increase was
during the first quarter of 2015, compared with the fourth
quarter of 2014 in the June survey, the results showed.  The Fed has kept its benchmark  interest rate  near zero
since December 2008. It has also carried out two rounds of bond
purchases known as quantitative easing to reduce borrowing
costs.  In the first round starting in 2008, the Fed bought $1.25
trillion of mortgage-backed securities, $175 billion of federal
agency debt and $300 billion of Treasuries. In the second round,
announced in November 2010, the Fed bought $600 billion of
Treasuries.  To contact the reporter on this story:
