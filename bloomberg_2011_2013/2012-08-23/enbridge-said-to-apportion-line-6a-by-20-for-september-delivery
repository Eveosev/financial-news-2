Enbridge Inc. (ENB)  has apportioned
September crude deliveries on pipeline 6A by 20 percent, two
people with knowledge of the situation said.  Line 5 will be apportioned 8 percent and Line 14 by 13
percent over the delivery period, said the people, who declined
to be identified because the information isn’t public.  Graham White , a Calgary-based spokesman for the company,
said in an e-mail that Enbridge would issue the numbers today.
Pipelines are apportioned when orders to move crude exceed
capacity. Shippers must cut their requests to transport oil,
known as nominations, by the apportionment ratio.  Line 6A takes crude from Superior,  Wisconsin , to the
Griffith-Hartsdale area in  Indiana  and is operating under a
pressure restriction that limits the pipe’s capacity to 608,800
barrels a day, according to a January update on the company’s
 website . Line 5 runs from Superior to Sarnia, Ontario, and can
carry 491,200 barrels of oil a day.  Line 14 from Superior to Griffith-Hartsdale has a capacity
of 317,600-barrel-a-day. The line has been required to operate
under a 20 percent pressure restriction since an Aug. 7 restart.
The line shut down July 27 after the pipe leaked 1,200 barrels
of oil.  Ozark, Spearhead  Deliveries on Enbridge’s Ozark pipeline will be apportioned
96 percent for September, Larry Springer, a Houston-based
spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail. Nominations on the
Spearhead line will be apportioned 77 percent for September and
32 percent for October, he said.  Enbridge has been operating its Ozark and Spearhead
pipelines at a reduced rates since Aug. 4 while the company
reviews inspection data, Springer said yesterday.  The lower flow rate amounts to an overall 5 percent rate
reduction on both pipes, he said. The reduction on the Ozark
line will result in 2 1/2 days of “carryover into September,”
he said.  The Ozark pipe runs from Cushing,  Oklahoma , to Wood River,
 Illinois , and has a capacity of 215,000 barrels a day, according
to the Enbridge website. The Spearhead line runs from Flanagan,
Illinois, to Cushing and has a capacity of 193,300 barrels a
day.  To contact the reporters on this story:
