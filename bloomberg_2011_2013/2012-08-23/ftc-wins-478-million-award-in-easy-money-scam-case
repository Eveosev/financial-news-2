The U.S. Federal Trade Commission
said the operators of three “get-rich-quick” systems were
ordered to pay $478 million for deceiving almost 1 million
consumers with phony money-making claims.  The court order represents the largest litigated judgment
ever obtained by the agency and is part of its efforts to stop
scams that prey on financially distressed consumers, the FTC
said today in a  statement .  One system was sold with the promise that customers could
“quickly and easily earn substantial amounts of money by
purchasing homes at tax sales in their area ‘free and clear’ for
just ‘pennies on the dollar,’ and then turning around and
selling these homes for full market value or renting them out
for a profit,” the FTC said in its June 2009 complaint.  “This huge judgment serves notice to anyone thinking of
using phony get-rich-quick schemes to defraud consumers,”
Jeffrey Klurfeld, director of the FTC’s western division, said
in today’s statement. “It’s also a reminder to consumers that
they should be skeptical about these types of easy-money
claims.”  John Beck Amazing Profits LLC, John Alexander LLC, and Jeff
Paul LLC were among the defendants named in the case.  The court found that despite the marketers’ easy-money
claims, almost all the consumers who bought the $39.95 systems
lost money.  The case is FTC v. John Beck Amazing Profits LLC, 2:09-cv-
04719, U.S. District Court, Central District of  California  ( Los
Angeles ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
