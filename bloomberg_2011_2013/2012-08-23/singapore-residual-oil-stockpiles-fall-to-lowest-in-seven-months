Singapore â€™s stockpiles of residues,
a category including  fuel oil , fell to the lowest level in seven
months, according to data from the Ministry of Trade and
Industry.  Onshore inventories of  residues , a category that includes
fuel oil and low-sulfur waxy residue and excludes bitumen,
dropped 8.6 percent to 16.28 million barrels in the week ended
July 18,  International Enterprise Singapore , a unit of the
ministry, said today in an e-mailed statement. Supplies are at
the lowest since the week ended Jan. 18.  Stockpiles of  light distillates  such as naphtha, reformate
and gasoline declined 13 percent to 8.32 million barrels, the
lowest level since Feb. 11, 2009.  Middle distillates , a category
that includes gasoil and kerosene, rose 0.2 percent to 9.32
million barrels.  The trade ministry unit surveys refiners,  oil companies  and
storage terminals on a voluntary basis. The results may exclude
some offshore storage capacity, International Enterprise said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
