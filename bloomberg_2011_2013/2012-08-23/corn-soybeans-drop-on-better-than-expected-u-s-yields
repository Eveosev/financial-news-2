Corn fell for a second day as
Midwest crop-tour results showed fields in better condition than
expected after the worst U.S. drought in a half century.
Soybeans dropped from a record.  Corn yields in  Illinois  were estimated at 121.6 bushels an
acre, while in western  Iowa  fields averaged 146.5 bushels, Pro
Farmer Midwest Crop Tour findings showed yesterday. The  U.S.
Department of Agriculture  has pegged Illinois corn yields at 116
bushels and Iowa at 141 bushels  statewide . Drought spurred the
USDA to slash its domestic crop outlook on Aug. 10 to a six-year
low, sending corn prices to a record $8.49 a bushel in  Chicago .  “We can’t expect prices to be rising much further from
here given that most of the trouble is priced in, but there’s
also no room for a major retreat,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst
at Commerzbank AG, said by phone from  Frankfurt . “The supply
situation remains very tight.”  Corn for December delivery fell 0.4 percent to $8.315 a
bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade as of 1:25 p.m. London
time. The most-active price rallied 64 percent since mid-June as
the USDA cut its harvest forecast by 13 percent on Aug. 10 to
10.779 billion bushels.  Soybeans for November delivery were little changed at
$17.2825 a bushel, after earlier climbing to $17.4475, a record
for the most-active contract. On China’s Dalian Commodity
Exchange, soybeans for January delivery climbed to 4,896  yuan 
per metric ton ($20.97 per bushel), the highest settlement for a
most-active contract since July 2008 and an all-time high in
 dollar terms .  China  is the world’s biggest soybean consumer.  Crop Tour  Crop tour participants reported soybean-pod counts in
Illinois as 21 percent lower than a year earlier, in line with
the USDA’s projected drop in yields for the state. In western
Iowa, the tour found soybean-pod counts to be 16 percent lower
than a year earlier, while the USDA expects a 17 percent drop in
yields.  The Professional Farmers of America will estimate U.S. crop
output on Aug. 24, based partly on the findings of the tour, now
in its 20th year.  Wheat for December delivery rose 0.3 percent to $9.20 a
bushel in Chicago. In London, feed-wheat futures for November
delivery rose for an eighth straight session to 207.15 pounds
($328.87) a ton on NYSE Liffe, as wet weather eroded harvest
prospects in the U.K. In Paris, November-delivery milling wheat
dropped 0.1 percent to 266.50 euros ($334.88) a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Russia, the world’s third-largest wheat exporter last
season, cut its grain harvest forecast to 75 million tons after
dry weather curbed production, Agriculture Minister Nikolai Fedorov said on Rossiya 24 television today. The government
estimated output of no more than 80 million tons on July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
