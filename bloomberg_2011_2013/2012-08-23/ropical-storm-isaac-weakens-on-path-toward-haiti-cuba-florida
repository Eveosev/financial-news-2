Tropical Storm Isaac is “slightly
weaker and farther south” than previously thought, the National
Hurricane Center said, using reconnaissance data collected by an
Air Force Reserve aircraft.  Isaac was located 255 miles (410 kilometers) south-
southeast of  San Juan  in  Puerto Rico  with maximum sustained
winds of 40 miles per hour, down from 45 mph, the Miami-based
center said in an advisory at 5 a.m. Atlantic time.  “Re-strengthening is forecast during the next 48 hours and
Isaac could still become a hurricane on Friday before it reaches
Hispaniola,” the center said.  The storm may reach southern Florida on Monday, Aug. 27.  To contact the reporter on this story:
