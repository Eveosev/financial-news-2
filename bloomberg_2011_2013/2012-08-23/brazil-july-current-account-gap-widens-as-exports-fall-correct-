Brazil ’s foreign direct investment
in July reached the highest level since December 2010 and may
exceed the central bank’s $50 billion projections this year as
investors bet economic growth will accelerate.  Foreign direct investment in July rose to $8.4 billion from
$5.8 billion in June, the central bank said in a report
distributed today in Brasilia. Economists expected FDI of $7
billion, according to the median estimate from 18 analysts
surveyed by Bloomberg. Foreign investment in the year to date is
$38.1 billion and is on target to cover the projected $56
billion current account deficit this year, Tulio Maciel, head of
economic research at the central bank, told reporters today.  Since last August, President  Dilma Rousseff ’s
administration has cut the benchmark Selic rate to record lows,
encouraged lending and reduced taxes to shield Brazil from
 Europe ’s debt crisis and  China ’s economic slowdown. Central bank
President Alexandre Tombini told reporters last month that
foreign investment should “evolve favorably” in the second
half of the year. Daniel Snowden,  emerging markets  analyst at
Informa Global Markets, said foreign investors are focusing on
government measures to spur the economy.  “Investors are more optimistic on the long-term viability
of Brazil given the stimulus the government is providing,”
Snowden said in a telephone interview from  London . “They are
looking to get ahead of the curve.”  Trade Balance  Brazil’s trade surplus in July fell 8.3 percent from a year
earlier to $2.9 billion, according to the central bank. Exports
in July fell 5.6 percent to $21 billion from a year earlier,
while imports declined 5.2 percent to $18.1 billion.  The deficit in the  current account , the broadest measure of
trade in goods and services, widened in July to $3.8 billion
from $3.6 billion a year earlier. Analysts expected a gap of
$3.7 billion, according to the median estimate of 25 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg.  Companies operating in Brazil remitted $1.7 billion in
dividends and profits, compared with $1.8 billion a year
earlier.  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2014, the
most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose one basis point, or 0.01
percentage point, to 7.94 percent at 1:27 p.m. local time. The
real weakened 0.4 percent to 2.0246 per  U.S. dollar .  Domestic Demand  Domestic demand has shown signs of picking up as
unemployment remains low and government stimulus measures take
effect. Retail sales rose 1.5 percent in June, the most since
January. Brazil’s seasonally adjusted  economic activity index , a
proxy for gross domestic product, increased in June at the
fastest pace since March 2011.  Still, economists in the latest central bank survey cut
their 2012 growth forecast to 1.75 percent, marking the 13th
such decline in the past 15 weeks. Industrial production in June
fell 5.5 percent from a year prior.  The central bank forecasts growth of 2.5 percent this year,
down from 2.7 percent last year and 7.5 percent in 2010. The
economy will be growing at a 4 percent annual pace by year-end
and will enter 2013 at “cruising speed,” Finance Minister
 Guido Mantega  told reporters Aug 16.  To contact the reporters on this story:
