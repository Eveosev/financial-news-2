The leu strengthened as increased
global appetite for riskier assets on bets the U.S. Federal
Reserve will provide monetary stimulus outweighed concern that
 Romania ’s political turmoil will intensify.  The leu appreciated as much as 0.3 percent to 4.4952 per
and traded 0.1 percent higher at 4.4863 by 5:30 p.m. in
Bucharest after weakening 0.3 percent yesterday. Yields on
Romania’s dollar-denominated bond maturing in 2022 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 5.69 percent today
from 5.72 yesterday.  European and emerging-market stocks rallied after minutes
of the Fed’s last meeting showed many members favored more
stimulus unless the pace of the economic recovery picks up. The
power struggle between President Traian Basescu, whose
impeachment referendum was invalidated by a  Constitutional Court 
on Aug. 21, and Prime Minister Victor Ponta may continue until
general elections are held in the fourth quarter. Ponta has in
the past said future collaboration with Basescu is
“impossible.”  “The market mood has improved overnight with the release
of  Federal Reserve ’s minutes,” Vlad Muscalu, a senior economist
at ING Groep NV in Bucharest, wrote in a report to clients
today. “The leu has moved back to 4.48 per euro and looks to
firm a bit more. For the moment, it looks to be lacking the
vigor needed to clearly break past the 4.47 percent recent
high.”  The leu has lost 3.6 percent against the euro this year,
the third-worst performer among emerging-market currencies
tracked by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
