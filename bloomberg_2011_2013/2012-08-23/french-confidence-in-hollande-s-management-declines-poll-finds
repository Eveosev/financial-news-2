Fewer French people say they have
confidence in President  Francois Hollande ’s ability to deal with
major issues facing the country, according to a poll released
today.  The survey, conducted by CSA for  Les Echos , found that 49
percent of those questioned had confidence in his management,
down from 54 percent in July.  The poll, based on a survey of 998 people on Aug. 21 and
Aug. 22, had a margin of error of 2 percent, CSA said in an e-
mailed release.  Forty-seven percent of those surveyed said they didn’t have
confidence in Hollande, while 4 percent didn’t have an opinion,
the group said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
