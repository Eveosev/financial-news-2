Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  received a “B” in Global Finance magazine’s annual
grading of the world’s central bankers.  Bernanke’s grade was raised from “C” in 2011, while Mario Draghi was given a “B-” in his first year as president of the
European Central Bank, the magazine in New York said by e-mail
today.  Bank of Japan (8301)  Governor Masaaki Shirakawa received a “C-
,” down from last year’s “C,” while Mark Carney of Canada,
 Glenn Stevens  of Australia, Israel’s Stanley Fischer, Zeti Akhtar Aziz of Malaysia, Amando Tetangco of the Philippines and
Taiwan’s Fai-Nan Perng were awarded an “A.”  The report card for central bankers of 50 nations and the
ECB, first published in 1994, was based on their scale of
success in areas such as controlling inflation, meeting economic
growth goals and managing interest rates. The report was
published a week before Bernanke, Draghi and counterparts from
around the world arrive in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, for an annual
monetary-policy symposium.  “During one of the toughest years on record, the world’s
central bankers were tested as never before,” Global Finance
publisher Joseph Giarraputo said.  Argentina’s Mercedes Marco del Pont and Pedro Delgado of
Ecuador were graded the lowest, with a “D.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
