Schindler Holding AG (SCHP)  is lobbying the
Swiss government to make managers responsible for cartel fines
by revising a law, Handelszeitung reported, citing an interview
with Schindler general counsel Karl Hofstetter.  Schindler was fined 144 million euros ($181 million) in
2007 when it and three other elevator-makers were penalised by
the European Union for  cartel activity  in Belgium, Germany,
Luxembourg and The Netherlands.  To contact the reporter on this story:
