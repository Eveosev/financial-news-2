The  Atlanta Braves  beat the
Washington Nationals 5-1 to avoid a three-game sweep against
their National League Eastern Division rivals.  Kris Medlen pitched seven shutout innings as the Braves
halted a four-game losing streak and improved to 71-53. They’re
six games behind the Nationals, whose 77-47 record is the best
in  Major League Baseball .  Martin Prado drove in two runs for Atlanta, which sits atop
the standings for the two NL wild card playoff berths.  The St. Louis Cardinals (67-56) hold a half-game lead over
the Pittsburgh Pirates for the second wild-card spot after
beating the Houston Astros 4-2. The Pirates (67-57) lost to the
 San Diego Padres  by the same score.  The San Francisco Giants beat the Los Angeles Dodgers 8-4
to complete a three-game sweep and increase their lead over the
Dodgers atop the NL West to 2 1/2 games.  Matt Cain  allowed one
run over seven innings for the Giants (69-55), who have won five
of their past six games. The Dodgers fell to 67-58 and are one
game behind the Cardinals for the second wild card spot.  The NL Central-leading Cincinnati Reds have a 76-49 record
after a 3-2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies yesterday, while
the  New York  Mets’ losing streak reached four games after a 5-2
defeat against the Colorado Rockies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
