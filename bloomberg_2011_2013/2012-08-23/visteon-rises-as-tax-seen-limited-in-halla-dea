Visteon Corp. (VC) , the auto-parts maker
focusing on growing Asian operations, gained the most in 10 days
after a UBS Securities LLC analyst report said there would be a
“limited” capital-gain tax impact from divesting its stake in
South Korea’s  Halla Climate Control Corp. (018880)   Visteon rose 4.9 percent to $41.83 at at the close in New
York, the most since Aug. 13.  “The capital gain tax impact of divesting Halla is
limited,” Colin Langan, a UBS analyst, wrote in a report dated
yesterday.  “In Korea, the  capital gains  would likely be exempt
from tax under the U.S.-Korea tax law.”  Visteon owns 70 percent of Daejeon, South Korea-based
Halla. Visteon, based in Van Buren Township, Michigan, was
rebuffed in an attempt to buy the remainder after the National
Pension Service, which owns  8.1 percent  of Halla, rejected the
bid.  The U.S. auto-parts supplier, spun off from  Ford Motor Co. (F) 
in 2000, subsequently changed leadership when Chief Executive
Officer Don Stebbins resigned on Aug. 10. Visteon’s board
installed Tim Leuliette as interim chairman, president and CEO.
Visteon, since exiting bankruptcy in 2010, has been shedding
lower-margin revenue in vehicle interiors and lighting to focus
on faster-growing operations in Asia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
