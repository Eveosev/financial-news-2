Mary Schapiro , chairman of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission, canceled a vote on a
proposal to tighten money-market fund rules amid opposition from
fellow commissioners and a lobbying campaign by fund companies.  Three of the five commissioners told her they wouldn’t
support her proposal, Schapiro said in a statement today. Other
policy makers should address “one of the pieces of unfinished
business from the financial crisis,” Schapiro said.  “The declaration by the three commissioners that they will
not vote to propose reform now provides the needed clarity for
other policy makers as they consider ways to address the
systemic risks posed by money-market funds,” she said in the
statement. “I urge them to act.”  Schapiro, backed by the  Federal Reserve , has worked to make
money funds more stable since the collapse of the $62.5 billion
Reserve Primary Fund in September 2008. Its closing triggered a
wider run on money funds, helping to freeze global credit
markets.  The announcement marks a victory for the mutual-fund
industry, which has lobbied against the Schapiro proposal. The
plan called for funds to abandon their traditional $1 share
price, or to adopt capital buffers and redemption restrictions,
changes executives said would destroy products that manage $2.6
trillion for U.S. companies and households.  A vote on the proposal was expected to happen as early as
Aug. 29, though it hadn’t been formally scheduled. The  New York 
Times reported Schapiro’s decision to cancel the vote earlier
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
