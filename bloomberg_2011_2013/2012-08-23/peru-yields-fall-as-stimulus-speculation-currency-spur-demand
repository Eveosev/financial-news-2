Peruvian bonds rose, pushing yields
to a one-week low, after Federal Reserve policy makers signaled
readiness to boost stimulus measures, spurring investor appetite
for higher yielding, emerging-market debt.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due in August 2020 dropped one basis points, or
0.01 percentage point, to 4.58 percent, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The price rose 0.09 centimo to 121.4
centimos per sol.  “There’s a growing sensation that the U.S. will expand
quantitative easing,” said Hedmond Rios, a economist at Celfin
Capital in Santiago. “Foreign investors are betting the sol
will continue appreciating against the dollar and that’s helped
push down yields, particularly in the middle of the curve.”  The sol was little changed at 2.6150 per  U.S. dollar  at
today’s close, according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit. The
currency touched 2.6110 on Aug. 21, the strongest level since
1997,  data  from  Peru ’s financial regulator show.  Peru’s central bank didn’t  buy or sell dollars  in the  spot
market  today. The bank has purchased $785 million this month to
slow the sol’s advance.  Many members of the Fed’s policy committee said further
action would probably be needed “fairly soon” without evidence
of “substantial and sustainable” improvement in the U.S.
economic recovery, according to minutes of the July 31-Aug. 1
meeting published yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
