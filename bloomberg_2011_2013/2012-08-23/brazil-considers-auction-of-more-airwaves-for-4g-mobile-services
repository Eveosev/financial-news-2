Brazil ’s government is considering
an auction by December 2013 of airwaves that are held today by
television broadcasters and would be converted for use with 4G
wireless services.  The airwaves in the 700-megahertz spectrum band would be
freed up by June 2016 after TV networks such as Globo
Comunicacao e Participacoes SA and Grupo Record complete their
switch to digital broadcasts, said Joao Rezende, president of
Brazil’s phone regulatory agency, known as Anatel. Broadcasters
must make the transition under a June 2006 presidential decree.  Anatel  plans to conclude studies defining the use of the
airwaves by the end of this year, Rezende said yesterday in a
phone interview from Curitiba, Brazil. Once that process is
complete, the agency and the Communications Ministry will put
together an auction plan.  “It’s possible that we’ll create a space for fourth-
generation mobile services,” Rezende said. With 4G networks,
wireless carriers can offer high-definition video and faster
Internet speeds.  Brazil raised $1.4 billion in a June auction as its largest
carriers acquired wireless airwaves for 4G services in the 2.5-
gigahertz band. Telefonica Brasil SA is the nation’s biggest
mobile-phone company by subscribers, following by  Tim
Participacoes SA (TIMP3) , America Movil SAB and  Oi SA. (OIBR4)   To contact the reporters on this story:
