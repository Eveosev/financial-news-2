The Chicago White Sox defeated the
 New York  Yankees 2-1 to complete a three-game series sweep as
pitcher Chris Sale had 13 strikeouts over 7 2/3 innings.  Alex Rios hit a tie-breaking home run in the bottom of the
sixth inning last night in Chicago and Sale limited the Yankees
to three hits and issued only one walk.  Derek Jeter ’s homer was the lone run for the Yankees, who
fell to 72-52 and had their lead over the Tampa Bay Rays atop
the American League Eastern Division was cut to three games. The
Rays (69-55) beat the Kansas City Royals 5-3 yesterday for their
sixth win in seven games.  “It was a rough stretch for us, but we’re through it,”
Yankees manager  Joe Girardi , whose team plays the opener of a
three-game series tomorrow in Cleveland, told reporters. “We
still have the lead.”  The White Sox improved to 68-55 and maintain a two-game
lead over the Detroit Tigers in the AL Central. The Tigers (66-
57) yesterday beat the Toronto Blue Jays 3-2.  The  Texas Rangers  lead the AL West by five games over the
Oakland Athletics after a 12-3 win over the Baltimore Orioles
that pushed their league-leading record to 72-51.  The Rays (69-55) are in position for one of the AL’s two
wild-card playoff berths, while the A’s (67-56) beat the
Minnesota Twins 5-1 to move a half-game ahead of Orioles (67-57)
for the second wild-card spot. The Tigers are one game behind
with the Los Angeles Angels 3 1/2 back at 64-60 after a 7-3 win
over the  Boston Red Sox .  To contact the reporter on this story:
