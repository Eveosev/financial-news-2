The ruble rallied to the strongest
in two weeks as oil gained on speculation central banks in the
U.S. and  China  will ease monetary policy to stimulate growth.  The Russian currency advanced 0.7 percent versus the dollar
to 31.6800 at 7 p.m. in Moscow. It weakened 0.4 percent against
the euro to 39.8899, leaving it 0.1 percent higher against the
central bank’s currency basket, which is 55 percent dollars and
45 percent euros.  Brent crude  rose as much as 1.3 percent to $116.38, the
highest level since May, after the U.S. Federal Reserve signaled
readiness to boost record stimulus, according to  minutes  of July
31-Aug. 1 meeting published yesterday. People’s Bank of China
Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said yesterday that adjustments to rates
and bank reserve requirements can’t be ruled out.  “The ruble is indeed relatively robust today, at least
relative to other  emerging markets  currencies,” Vladimir
Osakovskiy, chief economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch in
Moscow, said by e-mail today. “We tend to attribute that to
strong  oil prices .”  Investors pared bets on the ruble weakening against the
dollar, with non-deliverable forwards showing the currency at
32.1564 in three months versus 32.3951 on Aug. 22.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over U.S. Treasuries fell two basis points to 220,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 rose two basis
points to 7.9 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
