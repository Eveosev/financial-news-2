What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which resume trading at 5 p.m.
on the  Chicago  Board of Trade.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel lower in
Chicago as field samples from the Professional Farmer Crop Tour
showed yields in some Midwest states may be better than forecast
by the  U.S. Department of Agriculture , Doug Etheridge, senior
vice president, futures and options, at RBC Wealth Management in
Charlotte,  North Carolina , said by telephone.  -- Soybean futures may open steady to 1 cent a bushel lower on
the CBOT on better-than-expected crop prospects, Etheridge said.
Soybean-oil futures are expected to open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a
pound lower, and soybean-meal futures may open $1 to $2 lower
per 2,000 pounds.  -- Wheat futures are called to open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel
lower in Chicago, Etheridge said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
