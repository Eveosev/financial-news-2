Research In Motion Ltd. (RIM)  plans to
soon begin commercial talks with Canadian wireless carriers such
as  BCE Inc. (BCE)  and  Rogers Communications Inc. (RCI/B)  after showing them
early versions of the BlackBerry 10 phone this week.  Rogers and BCE were among the first to sell BlackBerry
devices when they debuted more than a decade ago and will again
be key to spreading early enthusiasm for the new models, said
Andrew MacLeod, who heads the company’s Canadian business.  “It’s important to show strength in our home market,”
MacLeod told reporters today at a briefing in Waterloo, Ontario,
near RIM’s headquarters. “We are working with Canadian
operators to develop a true platform launch.”  RIM is counting on BB10 to get it back in the game with
 Apple Inc. (AAPL)  and  Google Inc. (GOOG) ’s more popular platforms after U.S.
and Canadian consumers dumped BlackBerry models in favor of
devices like the touchscreen iPhone. That trend cut RIM’s share
of the global smartphone market to 4.8 percent in the second
quarter from 12 percent a year earlier, according to IDC.  RIM has said it plans to introduce a BB10 model with a
traditional keyboard and a full touchscreen version in the first
quarter of next year. MacLeod said he couldn’t confirm whether
RIM has begun talks with major U.S. carriers such as  Verizon
Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T)   RIM was little changed at $7.07 at the close in New York.
The stock has dropped 95 percent from its mid-2008 high.  To contact the reporter on this story:
