China ’s manufacturing may contract
at a faster pace in August, a private survey indicated.  The 47.8 preliminary reading for a purchasing managers’
index released by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today
compares with a final 49.3 for July. A number below 50 indicates
contraction. The gauge hasn’t shown an expansion since the
October reading.  China’s economic slowdown may extend into a seventh quarter
after industrial output and new loans in July missed estimates
and export growth collapsed to 1 percent. Deutsche Bank AG, Bank
of America Corp. and Morgan Stanley this month cut their
forecasts for the nation’s expansion in 2012.    Today’s preliminary reading, called the Flash PMI, is based
on 85 percent to 90 percent of responses to a survey of more
than 420 companies, according to HSBC. The government’s own
monthly index, due to be released on Sept. 1, had a July reading
of 50.1, the weakest in eight months.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
