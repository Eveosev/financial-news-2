The  New York  Yankees placed right-
handed pitcher Ivan Nova on the 15-day disabled list with an
injury in his throwing shoulder.  Nova, 25, has inflammation in his right rotator cuff, the
team said on Twitter. He is 11-7 this season with a 4.92 earned
run average in 25 starts for the Yankees, who lead the American
League East division by 2 1/2 games over the Tampa Bay Rays.  Nova’s place on the roster is expected to be taken by left-
handed pitcher CC Sabathia, who is eligible to come off the
disabled list after being sidelined with left elbow soreness.  Yankees manager  Joe Girardi  said “it’s pretty likely”
that Sabathia will start tonight against the Indians at
Cleveland’s Progressive Field.  Nova, whose 179 hits allowed this season is tied for the
most in  Major League Baseball , said his shoulder stiffened up in
the sixth inning of his loss three days ago at the Chicago White
Sox in which he allowed six runs in six innings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
