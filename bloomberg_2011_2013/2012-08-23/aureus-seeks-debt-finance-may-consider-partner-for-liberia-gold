Aureus Mining Inc. (AUE)  will try to raise
debt before looking at other financing including the possibility
of a venture partner for its New Liberty gold mine in  Liberia .  “Debt will be the primary driver, and then we’ll look at
the balance with equity, convertibles, royalties or bringing in
a strategic partner,” Chief Executive Officer David Reading
said. “There are people who will take a strategic position in a
project without taking ownership. That’s an option.”  About two-thirds of the “ball park” cost of $130 million
could be raised in debt, he said. Construction of the mine will
take about 18 months and may start in the first quarter. The
company is seeking to produce about an annual 120,000 ounces of
gold in the first four years at a cost of about $650 an ounce.  “We want to get it financed as quickly as we can and
commence construction,” Reading said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
