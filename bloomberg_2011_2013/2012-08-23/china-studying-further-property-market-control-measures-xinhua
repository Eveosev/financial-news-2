China ’s government is studying
further measures to strengthen its control of the property
market, the official Xinhua News Agency reported yesterday,
citing an official with the housing ministry.  The government  is “closely monitoring” changes in the
real estate market and has ordered local governments not to
relax property controls, the unidentified official with China’s
Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development was quoted as
saying in the Xinhua report.  Property buyers, buoyed by two interest-rate cuts since
June and incentives for first-time owners, have returned to the
market even as the government pledges to maintain real estate
curbs to make housing more affordable. China new-home prices
rose in 49 of the 70 cities tracked by the government in July,
the largest number of cities in 14 months, complicating the
government’s efforts to clamp down on property speculation.  Easing policies by some local authorities were among
problems that need “particular attention,” Xinhua reported on
Aug. 17, citing findings from an inspection ordered by the State
Council.  China’s  property market  is expected to stay stable, the
housing ministry official said in the Xinhua report. Most buyers
in recent months are first-time home owners, according to the
official.  To contact the reporter on this story:
