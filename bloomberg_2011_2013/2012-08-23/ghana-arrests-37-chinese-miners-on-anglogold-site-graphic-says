Ghanaian security officials arrested
37 Chinese nationals for mining gold on a concession belonging
to  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG) , the Daily Graphic reported.  The people used bulldozers to dig for ore near the
companyâ€™s airstrip at Obuasi in the Ashanti region, the Accra-
based newspaper cited Francis Dodovi, spokesman for the regional
minister, as saying. The unauthorized mining could affect
aircraft, Dodovi said, according to the paper.  The police in May arrested 38 Chinese in an AngloGold
concession at the Adansi area, also in the Ashanti region, and
seized machinery and weapons, the newspaper reported.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
