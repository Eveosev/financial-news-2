Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-
ore producer, declined to the lowest in almost three years as
prices for the steelmaking material slumped on slower Chinese
economic growth.  Vale, based in Rio de Janeiro,  dropped  3.2 percent to close
at 34.19 reais in  Sao Paulo , the lowest since Sept. 11, 2009.
The stock lost 9.6 percent this year, compared with a 3.1
percent  gain  in the Brazilian benchmark Bovespa Index.  Iron ore  for  immediate delivery  fell 4.9 percent to $99.60
a ton today, its seventh consecutive decline to the lowest since
December 2009, according to data compiled by The Steel Index
Ltd. Shares of Vale are falling because of lower iron-ore prices
and signs of slowing economic conditions in China, the biggest
user of the steelmaking raw material, said Leonardo Brito, an
equity analyst at hedge fund Teorica Investimentos.  “Prices are below $100 already, which is worrying,” he
said in a telephone interview from Rio. “If that continues for
some time, the profit forecasts for Vale will be lowered.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
