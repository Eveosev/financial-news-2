Taiwan ’s dollar advanced to a one-
week high as global investors poured funds into the island’s
stocks, betting central banks in the U.S. and China will ease
monetary policy to boost their economies.  Global funds bought $151 million more Taiwanese stocks than
they sold today, taking net purchases this month to $3.1
billion, according to exchange data. Minutes of the U.S. Federal
Reserve’s last meeting showed many members favored more stimulus
unless the pace of the economic recovery picks up. People’s Bank
of China Governor  Zhou Xiaochuan  said adjustments to  interest
rates  and banks’ reserve requirements are still possible after
the central bank stepped up temporary cash injections this
month. Bonds were steady.  “Foreign funds and exporters are driving Taiwan dollar’s
rise,” said Tarsicio Tong, a foreign-exchange trader at  Union
Bank of Taiwan. (2838)  “Speculation the U.S. will do quantitative
easing soon is back today.”  Taiwan’s dollar advanced 0.2 percent to NT$29.96 against
its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched
NT$29.85 earlier, the strongest level since Aug. 15. One-month
implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings used to
price options, dropped 10 basis points to 3.1 percent.  Industrial production fell 0.02 percent in July from a year
earlier, a fifth monthly drop, official data showed today.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent notes due March 2022 was
steady at 1.184 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight money-market rate  stood at 0.387 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
