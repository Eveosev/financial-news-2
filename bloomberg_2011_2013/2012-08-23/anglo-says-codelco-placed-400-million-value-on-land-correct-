(Corrects tax number in second paragraph.)  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  said Codelco
placed a value of about $400 million on undeveloped land it will
transfer from its Sur unit to the Chilean state-owned company as
part of a deal to settle claims.  Anglo placed nominal commercial value on the mining
tenements, Peter Whitcutt, group director of strategy and
business development, said on a conference call with reporters
