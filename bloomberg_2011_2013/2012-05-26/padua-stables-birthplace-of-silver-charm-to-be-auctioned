Padua Stables, the 763-acre  Florida 
horse farm where 1997  Kentucky Derby  and Preakness Stakes winner
Silver Charm was foaled, will be auctioned May 31, nine days
after Secretariat’s birthplace in Virginia was sold.  The Ocala, Florida, farm is owned by Satish Sanan, who
invested $30 million in improvements since 1998. Sanan moved his
thoroughbred racing operations to Lexington,  Kentucky , in 2007.  “We were shipping our high-end mares from Florida to
Kentucky and back every year, and it didn’t make financial sense
anymore,” Sanan said in a statement on the auctioneer’s
website. “It’s a shame because we put our heart and soul and a
lot of capital into the farm in Florida, but it’s the best thing
for the business to do.”  The farm includes an 8,000-square-foot, eight-bedroom
owners’ home, 22-room dormitory, breeding and training
facilities, 3/4-mile dirt track and 20 run-in paddocks.  After winning the first two legs of thoroughbred racing’s
Triple Crown, Silver Charm came in second to Touch Gold in the
Belmont Stakes.  Mark Lovell, an expositions promoter, purchased the
birthplace of Secretariat, the winner of horse racing’s Triple
Crown in 1973, and the  Virginia  State Fairgrounds for $5.35
million at a foreclosure auction.  To contact the reporter on this story:
