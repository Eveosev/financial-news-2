Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN) ’s Chairman Urs Rohner would have already replaced Chief Executive Officer Brady Dougan if a suitable successor was available, Tages-Anzeiger
reported, citing unidentified people.  The Zurich-based newspaper said potential candidates for
the post including Hans-Ulrich Meister, the bank’s head of
private banking, Walter Berchtold and  Deutsche Bank (DBK) ’s Hugo Baenziger don’t stand a chance of appointment to the role.  Andres Luther, a spokesman for Credit Suisse, declined to
comment, referring to an interview with Rohner in Swiss
newspaper Le Temps on April 21, in which the chairman said
“Brady Dougan is the man for the job at Credit Suisse, there’s
no doubt in my mind.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
