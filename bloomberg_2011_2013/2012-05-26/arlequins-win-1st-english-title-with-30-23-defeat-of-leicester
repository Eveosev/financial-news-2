Harlequins won their first English
rugby title, using six penalties from  Nick Evans  to defeat
Leicester 30-23 today at Londonâ€™s Twickenham.  A try from  Tom Williams  and three penalties from Evans gave
the new champions a 14-13 halftime lead. Leicester kept it close
with a try from Steve Mafi and eight points from George Ford.  Thomas Waldrom was yellow carded and Leicester conceded 9
points during his absence. England captain Chris Robshaw also
had a try, and was named man of the match.  Leicester, which has won 11 English titles, was playing in
