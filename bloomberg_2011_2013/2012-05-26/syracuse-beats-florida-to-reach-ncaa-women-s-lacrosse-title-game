Syracuse University  and  Northwestern
University  will meet in the women’s college lacrosse national
championship game.  Sarah Holden’s goal in the second overtime period gave No.
4 Syracuse a 14-13 win last night against top-seeded University
of Florida in the first National Collegiate Athletic Association
semifinal at LaValle Stadium in Stony Brook,  New York .  Holden’s fourth goal of the game capped a Syracuse (19-3)
comeback from a seven-goal deficit.  “It actually was kind of slow motion,” Holden said. “I
remember specifically the first play of the game when we were in
our set offense, and I went low and the goalie made a save. I
was 100-percent certain that would not happen to me again. So, I
just did a split dodge, buried it and it went in.”  A goal by Florida’s Gabi Wiegand with nine seconds
remaining in the first overtime was disallowed because officials
ruled she had an illegal stick because the pocket was too deep.  Shannon Gilroy scored five goals and Brittany Dashiell
added four for the Gators (19-3), who led 12-5 midway through
the second half.  Taylor Thornton and Jessica Russo scored two goals apiece
as second-seeded Northwestern won 9-7 against No. 3 Maryland,
which got three goals from Katie Schwarzmann. The championship
contest is set tomorrow in  Stony Brook .  In the men’s NCAA lacrosse semifinals today at Foxborough,
Massachusetts, it will be  Notre Dame  against Loyola Maryland and
Duke facing Maryland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
