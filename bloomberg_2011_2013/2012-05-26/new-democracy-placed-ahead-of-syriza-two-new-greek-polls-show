Two new Greek opinion polls showed
the bailout-supporting conservative  New Democracy  party
maintaining a lead ahead of June 17 elections over Syriza, which
opposes implementing  the program .  New Democracy had 25.6 percent support while Syriza had
22.9 percent, a survey of 1,000 Greeks by Alco for the Proto
Thema newspaper showed today. The socialist Pasok party garnered
14 percent, according to the poll.  New Democracy was also placed first in a poll of 1,212
people by Pulse RC for Tipos tis Kiriakis newspaper. The party
registered 26.5 percent, compared with 26 percent for Syriza and
15.5 percent for Pasok.  New Democracy was placed first in six different polls
published today with a margin over Syriza of as much as 5.7
percentage points. The latest that polls can be held is two
weeks before election day.  The Alco poll was conducted May 20 to May 25 while Pulse
took opinions on May 23 and May 24. Neither poll gave a margin
of error.  To contact the reporter on this story:
