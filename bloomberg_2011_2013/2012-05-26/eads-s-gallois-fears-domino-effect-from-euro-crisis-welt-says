European Aeronautic, Defence and
Space Co. Chief Executive Officer  Louis Gallois  said the
European debt crisis has worsened and fears a “domino effect”
if Greece leaves the euro zone.  Differences of opinion between  Germany  and some countries
over balancing growth and budgetary discipline create
“uncertainty,” Gallois said in a preview of an interview with
Welt am Sonntag, the Berlin-based newspaper, due to appear
tomorrow. The euro is “extremely important” for a company like
EADS, Gallois, who steps down at the end of this month, said.  Gallos also said that cracks found in EADS’s Eurocopter
EC135 helicopters in an area where rotor blades are attached
haven’t cost the company “a significant amount” so far.  To contact the reporter on this story:
