The U.K. is calling for a “strong
international response” following reports of a massacre of
civilians by Syrian forces in a town in Homs province.  More than 90 adults and children were killed during
shelling and shootings by government forces in Houla in the past
24 hours, the U.K.-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights
said in an e-mailed statement. Explosions were also heard in the
city of Homs, it said. British Foreign Secretary  William Hague 
called the killings “an appalling crime” and said the U.K.
would be calling for an “urgent” meeting of the UN  Security
Council .  “There are credible and horrific reports that a large
number of civilians have been massacred at the hands of Syrian
forces in the town of Houla, including children,” Hague said in
an e-mailed statement today. “We are consulting urgently with
our allies on a strong international response, including at the
UN Security Council, the EU and UN Human Rights bodies.”  More than 9,000 people have been slain by Syrian leader
Bashar al-Assad’s forces since March 2011, when protests began
as part of the wave of uprisings in the  Middle East , according
to a UN estimate in late March. Violence continues almost two
months after Assad and opposition forces accepted a peace plan
by UN special envoy  Kofi Annan .  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said there has been “some
reduction in the intensity of fighting” in areas of  Syria  where
there are UN observers.  Peace Plan  “That said, the overall level of violence in the country
remains quite high” and the Syrian government isn’t implementing
the UN peace plan, Ban said in a report yesterday to the
Security Council.  He said there has been little progress in implementing the
six-point plan that Assad agreed to with Annan.  “Measured against the commitments embodied in the six-
point plan, the overall situation remains extremely serious and
there has been only small progress on some issues,” Ban said.
“There is a continuing crisis on the ground, characterized by
regular violence, deteriorating humanitarian conditions, human
rights violations, and continued political confrontation.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
