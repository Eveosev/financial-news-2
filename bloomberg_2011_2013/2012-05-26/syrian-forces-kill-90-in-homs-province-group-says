Syrian forces killed more than 90
people in the town of Houla in Homs province in the past 24
hours, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said.  The Syrian army’s attack on the town “claimed the lives of
dozens of women and children,” the  U.K.-based opposition group 
said in an e-mailed statement today. Explosions were also heard
in the city of Homs, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
