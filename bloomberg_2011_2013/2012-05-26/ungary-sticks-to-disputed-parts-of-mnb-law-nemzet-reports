Hungary is refusing to amend disputed
parts of a central bank law despite pressure from the  European
Central Bank  and the  International Monetary Fund ,  Magyar Nemzet 
said today, citing unidentified people at the  Economy Ministry .  The government wants the Monetary Policy Council, and not
the president of the  Magyar Nemzeti Bank , to have authority over
the country’s foreign currency reserves, even though the
international institutions have criticized this part of the law,
according to the Budapest-based daily. The Cabinet also wants to
nominate a third vice president at the bank, it said.  Final amendments to the central bank law aren’t yet public
as negotiations between the ECB, the IMF, the European Union,
the central bank and the government are continuing and the
Cabinet wants to persuade its partners on these two issues,
Nemzet said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
