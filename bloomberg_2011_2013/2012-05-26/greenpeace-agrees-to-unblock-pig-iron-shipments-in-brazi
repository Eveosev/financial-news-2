Greenpeace unblocked the Brazilian
port of Sao Luis after eight hours of protest against an amnesty
for illegal loggers in the Amazon jungle, according to an e-
mailed statement.  It suspended the protest after the Maranhao state deputy
governor, Washington Luiz de Oliveira, agreed to negotiate with
the pig-iron industry in the region, Greenpeace said in the e-
mail. The industry often uses wood to run their furnaces,
Greenpeace said.  The group said the negotiations will address illegal
deforestation, labor conditions and protection of indigenous
peoplesâ€™ land.  To contact the reporter on this story:
