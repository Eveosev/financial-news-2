A Greek opinion poll showed the  New
Democracy  party, which supports implementing  Greece ’s
international financial rescue, overtaking the anti-bailout
 Syriza  party ahead of June 17 elections, the  Athens News Agency 
reported.  New Democracy  got 23.6 percent, compared with Syriza’s 21.4
percent, while the socialist Pasok party, which also favors
Greece’s bailout program, garnered 13.1 percent, the state-run
news agency said, citing a poll by Rass for the weekend edition
of Metro, an Athens-based newspaper. It didn’t give the margin
of error.  In a previous Rass poll published on May 19, Syriza had
21.7 percent support, New Democracy 20.2 percent and Pasok 11.7
percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
