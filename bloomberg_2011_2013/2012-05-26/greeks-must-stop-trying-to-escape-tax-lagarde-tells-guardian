Director  Christine Lagarde  says she has more sympathy for
deprived children in sub-Saharan Africa than for many of those
facing poverty in  Greece .  Greek parents have to take responsibility if their children
are being affected by spending cuts and “have to pay their
tax,” Lagarde said in an interview with the U.K.’s Guardian.  “I think more of the little kids from a school in a little
village in Niger who get teaching two hours a day, sharing one
chair for three of them, and who are very keen to get an
education,” Lagarde told the newspaper. “I have them in my
mind all the time. Because I think they need even more help”
than people in Greece.  “As far as Athens is concerned, I also think about all
those people who are trying to escape tax all the time,”
Lagarde added. “All these people in Greece who are trying to
escape tax. I think they should also help themselves
collectively.” Asked how, she said, “By all paying their
tax.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
