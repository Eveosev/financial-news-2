Captain  Andrew Strauss  got a
consecutive century as England got to within 111 runs of West
Indies on the second day of their second cricket Test.  Strauss and Kevin Pietersen, unbeaten on 72, combined for
136 runs for the hosts at Trent Bridge in Nottingham. England
finished the day on 259-2 in response to 370 from West Indies.  Alastair Cook was caught on 24 off the bowling of Ravi
Rampaul, who also trapped Jonathan Trott leg before wicket on
35. Rampaul finished 2-42.  Marlon Samuels and captain Darren Sammy combined for 204
runs to push West Indies to 370 all out. The pair started the
day after settling the visitors yesterday by combining for 168
runs. That allowed the West Indies to reach 304-6 at the end of
the day after the fall of four early wickets.  Tim Bresnan  was 4-104 for England, including the wickets of
Samuels, caught on 117, and Sammy caught on 106.  Stuart Broad ,
 James Anderson  and Graeme Swann each took two wickets.  West Indies stumbled at the start of the match, and were
restricted to 84-4 at lunch of the opening day. The visitors won
the toss and elected to bat.  England won the first Test by 5 wickets at Lord’s in
 London , and needs to win the three-match series to stay atop the
International Cricket Council’s Test rankings ahead of South
Africa. England will host South Africa in a best-of-three
contest in July and August. West Indies hasn’t won an away Test
in a country other than bottom-ranked Bangladesh since winning
in  South Africa  in December 2007.  West Indies is unbeaten in eight previous Tests at Trent
Bridge, winning four and drawing four.  To contact the reporter on this story:
