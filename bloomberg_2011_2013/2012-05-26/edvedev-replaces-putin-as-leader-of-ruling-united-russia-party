Russian Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev  replaced President  Vladimir Putin  as chairman of the
ruling United Russia party after the two men swapped jobs in the
Kremlin.  Medvedev, speaking at the party congress in Moscow today,
urged United Russia members to work to ensure the organization
retained a majority of parliamentary seats in the next elections
due in five years.  “United Russia must become number one again and win the
parliamentary majority again,” he said before his election as
chairman by the congress.  Putin attended the party meeting and supported Medvedev’s
candidacy. The outcome is a vote of confidence in Medvedev,
whose political influence waned after he agreed to step aside as
president to make way for Putin’s return to the Kremlin.  Medvedev led  United Russia ’s list of candidates in
December’s parliamentary election when it lost the two-thirds
majority that allows a party to change the constitution
unilaterally. Opposition parties accused the authorities of
rigging the ballot to inflate United Russia’s share of the vote
to about half from 30 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
