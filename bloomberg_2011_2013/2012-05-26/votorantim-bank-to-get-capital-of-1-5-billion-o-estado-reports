Banco do Brasil SA  and the Ermirio de
Moraes family may invest 3 billion reais ($1.5 billion) in Banco
Votorantim SA after higher bad-loan provisions,  O Estado de S.
Paulo  reported, without saying how it got the information.  Banco do Brasil and the Ermirio de Moraes family, which
share control of Votorantim, plan to invest 2 billion reais this
year, with the remainder to be added next year, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper said. Each shareholder would contribute half of
the amount in a private placement, O Estado said.  Banco do Brasil declined to comment, the newspaper said.
The Ermirio de Moraes family told O Estado in an e-mailed
statement that it is prepared for a capitalization of the unit.  To contact the reporter on this story:
