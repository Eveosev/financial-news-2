(Corrects Simpson’s title in first paragraph of a story
that ran May 27.)  Former U.S. Senator  Alan Simpson , co-
chairman of President Barack Obama’s fiscal commission, told  CNN 
he considers himself a “RINO” -- Republican in name only --
because of social views advocated by members of his party.  “Abortion is a horrible thing, but for heaven’s sakes, a
deeply intimate and personal decision and men legislators
shouldn’t even be able to vote on it,” Simpson said on CNN’s
“Fareed Zakaria GPS” program. “Gays/lesbian issues. We’re all
human beings. We’re all God’s children. What is this?”  Simpson also questioned the influence on elected officials
of Grover Norquist, president of Americans for  Tax Reform , who
has members of Congress sign a pledge that they won’t raise
taxes. The interview is scheduled to air today.  “You have  Grover Norquist  wandering the earth in his white
robes saying that if you raise taxes one penny, he’ll defeat
you,” Simpson said. “He can’t murder you. He can’t burn your
house. The only thing he can do to you as an elected official is
defeat you for re-election.”  Politicians who put re-election before the good of the
country “shouldn’t even be in Congress,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
