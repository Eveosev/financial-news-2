BFA-Bankia Chairman Jose Ignacio
Goirigolzarri said the bank does not expect to turn preference
shares into capital and that the entity is still working on a
plan for the instruments.  “We don’t forecast that the solution will be to turn them
into capital,” he told a briefing to reporters today in  Madrid .
“We’re working on it and we want it to be as soon as possible,
and before the  shareholders’ meeting  on June 29.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
