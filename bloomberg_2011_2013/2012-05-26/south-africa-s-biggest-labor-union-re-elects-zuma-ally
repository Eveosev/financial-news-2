South Africa ’s largest labor union,
the  National Union of Mineworkers , re-elected Frans Baleni as
general-secretary, bolstering President Jacob Zuma’s campaign to
win a second term.  Baleni, a Zuma ally, defeated his deputy Oupa Komane at the
NUM’s national conference in Johannesburg today,  Lesiba Seshoka ,
a spokesman for the union, said in a text message.  With about 300,000 members, the NUM is the largest member
of the Congress of South African Trade Unions, the labor group
that helped Zuma oust his predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, as leader of
the ruling African National Congress in 2007. Zuma became
president of Africa’s biggest economy two years later.  The NUM has produced some of South Africa’s top political
leaders, including Deputy President  Kgalema Motlanthe ,  Gwede
Mantashe , the ANC’s secretary-general and Cyril Ramaphosa, the
party’s former secretary-general and one of the country’s
wealthiest black businessmen.  Baleni opposed a push by the ANC Youth League to
nationalize the country’s mines, saying it is scaring off
potential investors, the Johannesburg-based Sunday Times
reported on July 3. The youth league has dropped its support for
Zuma ahead of the ANC’s elective conference in December.  South Africa is the world’s biggest producer of platinum
and chrome and also produces gold and diamonds.  To contact the reporters on this story:
