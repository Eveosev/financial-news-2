Syriza party, said he wants to do everything possible to keep
the country in the euro zone,  Der Spiegel  reported, citing an
interview with the politician.  “We need policies that won’t destroy the  Greek economy ,
but which instead allow the re-establishing of growth,” the
German magazine quoted him as saying.  Tsipras has pledged to rip up the terms of Greece’s rescue
international rescue package and halt the austerity measures
agreed with creditors. Greece is preparing for June 17 elections
after an inconclusive May 6 ballot.  -- Editors: John Viljoen, Paul Richardson  To contact the reporter on this story:
