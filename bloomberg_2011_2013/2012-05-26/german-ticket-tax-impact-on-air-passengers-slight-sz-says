Germany’s Ministry of Finance said
the introduction of a ticket tax 1 1/2 years ago only caused a
slight drop in the number of airline passengers in the country,
 Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported, citing an internal document.  An average surge of 40 percent in the price of fuel in 2011
affected the number of passengers, the German newspaper said,
citing the document.  To contact the reporter on this story:
