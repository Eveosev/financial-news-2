Brazil  may reduce its primary surplus
target to as low as 2.5 percent from the current 3.1 percent
this year to support economy growth,  O Estado de S. Paulo 
reported, citing government officials it didn’t identify.  The government would cut the target if the international
crisis gets worse, and credit and consumption measures taken so
far prove not enough to allow faster expansion than last year’s
2.7 percent, according to the Sao Paulo-based newspaper.  The primary surplus excludes interest payments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
