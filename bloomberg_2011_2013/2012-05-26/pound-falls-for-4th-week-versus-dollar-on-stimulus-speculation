The pound declined for a fourth week
against the dollar, the longest run of losses since September,
amid speculation the  Bank of England  will restart its program of
asset purchases to spur growth.  Gilts advanced for a fifth week, with two-, five- and 10-
year yields dropping to records, as government reports showed
gross domestic product shrank more than initially estimated and
retail sales declined. U.K. bonds rallied as minutes of the Bank
of England’s May 10 meeting showed the Monetary Policy
Committee’s decision to halt its 325 billion-pound ($510
billion) bond-purchase program was “finely balanced.”  “I have flipped from pound bull to pound bear,” said  Neil Jones , head of European hedge-fund sales at Mizuho Corporate
Bank Ltd. in London. “Quantitative easing back on the table and
the June MPC meeting may prove seismic.”  The pound depreciated 1.1 percent this week to $1.5648 at
4:51 p.m.  London  time yesterday, after sliding to $1.5631, the
lowest level since March 13. Sterling advanced 1 percent over
the five days to 79.99 pence per euro.  Minutes of the Bank of England’s meeting released on May 23
showed the central bank thought there was a case for it to
resume stimulus, and it could do so if needed. Still, only one
of the nine-member MPC voted to add to quantitative easing at
the gathering.  “An exceptionally expansionary monetary policy” is
appropriate to address risks of permanent damage to the economy
and higher unemployment, MPC member  David Miles  said in a May 24
speech in London.  Gilts Gain  The 10-year gilt  yield  fell seven basis points, or 0.07
percentage point, this week to 1.75 percent. The 4 percent bond
due March 2022 gained 0.67, or 6.70 pounds per 1,000-pound face
amount, to 120.10. The yield dropped to 1.738 percent on May 24,
the lowest since Bloomberg began compiling data on the
securities in 1989.  The  five-year yield  fell to a record 0.707 percent
yesterday, and the two-year yield declined to an all-time low of
0.21 percent.  GDP shrank 0.3 percent in the first quarter, more than the
0.2 percent drop estimated last month, the  Office for National
Statistics  said May 24. Retail sales including auto fuel
declined 2.3 percent from March, the office reported May 23.  Sterling dropped 0.1 percent this week, according to
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes, which track 10
developed-nation currencies. The dollar gained 1.1 percent, and
the euro weakened 0.9 percent.  Gilts have returned 3 percent in May, according to indexes
compiled by Bloomberg and the European Federation of Financial
Analysts Societies. German bunds gained 2 percent, and  U.S.
Treasuries  rose 1.3 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
