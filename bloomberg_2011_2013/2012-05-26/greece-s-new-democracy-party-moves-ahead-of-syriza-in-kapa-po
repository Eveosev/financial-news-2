New Democracy ,  Greece ’s largest pro-
bailout party, is leading Syriza, which is opposed to
implementing Greece’s international rescue program, according to
a poll of their support in the June 17 elections.  Of 1,016 people questioned by Kapa Research SA for the
Athens-based To Vima newspaper, 25.8 percent said they would
vote for New Democracy, 20.1 percent for Syriza and 13 percent
for the socialist Pasok party, which also backs the  bailout .  The results showed New Democracy improving its support to
25.8 percent from 18.1 percent in the last poll done by the
company, on May 9 and May 10, following inconclusive May 6
elections. Syriza’s support dropped marginally from the 20.5
percent it scored in that poll.  More than six in 10 people, or 65.2 percent, said they
wanted the country to remain in the euro area, even if that
meant implementing the austerity measures agreed on in return
for the international bailout, the poll showed. Some 24.4
percent said the country should abandon the euro if required to
implement the measures. Almost seven in 10, or 69.6 percent,
said they supported the sale of state assets to reduce debt.  Kapa’s poll was conducted May 23 and May 24. The overall
margin of error is 3.1 percentage points.  To contact the reporters on this story:
