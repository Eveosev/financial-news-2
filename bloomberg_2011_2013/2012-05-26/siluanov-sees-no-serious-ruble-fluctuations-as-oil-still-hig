Russian Finance Minister Anton
Siluanov said he doesn’t expect any “serious fluctuations” of
the ruble as oil prices remain high.  “Crude prices slightly declined but are still stable and
quite high,” Siluanov told reporters today in Moscow. “I
therefore don’t expect any serious ruble fluctuations.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
