A Greek opinion poll before the
country’s June 17 elections showed the conservative  New
Democracy  party, the largest pro-bailout group, leading Syriza,
which opposes implementing an international rescue program.  Of 1,075 people surveyed by Marc SA for the Athens-based
Ethnos newspaper, 27.7 percent said they’d vote for New
Democracy, 25.5 percent for Syriza and 15.2 percent for the
socialist Pasok party which also supports the bailout program.  The result would give New Democracy 125 seats, Syriza 69
and Pasok 41 in Greece’s 300-seat Parliament. The figures strip
out people who intend not to vote or to spoil their ballot
papers.  Greece’s retention of the euro was supported by 82.4
percent of those interviewed, compared with 12 percent who
wanted a return of the drachma. Some 54.4 percent didn’t expect
a Greek exit from the single currency area, while 39.5 percent
said they did.  Greece  should re-discuss the terms of its
international bailout, 64.8 percent of respondents said.  Antonis Samaras, leader of New Democracy, was the choice of
46.2 percent of those polled to govern Greece, compared with
38.4 percent who preferred Syriza leader Alexis Tsipras as prime
minister. The poll was conducted May 22 to May 24. The overall
margin of error wasn’t given.  To contact the reporter on this story:
