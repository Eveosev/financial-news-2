France ’s bonds rose in the week, with
10-year yields falling the most in five months, as investors
sought higher-yielding alternatives to German securities as
havens from Europe’s debt crisis.  Yields on the French benchmark debt slid to a record
yesterday as a report showed  consumer confidence  improved and
after Le Parisien reported the government may raise tax-free
state savings-account limits, potentially boosting demand from
banks holding the deposits. German 30-year bonds pared a fourth
week of gains as Italian Prime Minister  Mario Monti  said
Europe’s largest economy can be persuaded to support joint euro
bonds. Spanish 10-year yields stayed above 6 percent.  “It may just be a product of a hunt for yield as the yield
compression has continued almost unabated across the bund curve
to the point where even 30-year bonds dipped below 2 percent,”
said  Richard McGuire , a senior fixed-income strategist at
Rabobank International in London. “That perhaps informed the
positive performance that we’ve seen in semi-core paper.”  The French 10-year yield fell 34 basis points, or 0.34
percentage point this week, to 2.52 percent at 4:28 p.m. London
time yesterday, after reaching 2.422 percent, the least since
Bloomberg began collecting the data in 1990. The 3 percent bond
due April 2022 rose 2.93, or 29.30 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,257)
face amount, to 104.19.  Austria’s five-year note yield was at 1.25 percent, after
falling to a record 1.216 percent.  Spread to Bunds  The extra yield, or spread, that investors get for buying
10-year French bonds over similar-maturity  German bunds  narrowed
28 basis points in the week 114 basis points. It widened to a
euro-era record 204 basis points in November.  Investors looking for safety within  Europe  amid speculation
that  Greece  may withdraw from the monetary union are looking
beyond  Germany , which sold two-year notes on May 23 at an all-
time low average yield of 0.07 percent. The securities carried a
zero-percent coupon. The country also sold index-linked bonds
due April 2023 with a real yield of minus 0.24 percent.  “Dramatic rallies in core-to-semi-core markets have
dominated price action in the past couple of days,”  Padhraic Garvey , head of developed-market debt at ING Groep NV in
Amsterdam, wrote in a note to clients yesterday. “The likes of
France, Austria and Belgium are perceived to be offering the
characteristics of relative safety, but with a spread that more
than compensates for the extra risk.”  Bund Yields  Benchmark 10-year German  bund yields  declined six basis
points to 1.37 percent.  An index of executive and consumer sentiment in the 17-
nation euro area fell to 91.9 from 92.8 in April, the European
Commission in Brussels will say on May 30, according to the
median prediction of 28 economists in a Bloomberg News survey
before the report on May 30.  Spanish 10-year bond yields rose five basis points this
week to 6.32 percent. The rate on similar-maturity Italian debt
fell 15 basis points to 5.66 percent.  German debt has returned 3.4 percent this year through May
24, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and the European
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies. French securities
have gained 5.3 percent, while France’s bonds due in 10 years or
longer advanced 9.1 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
