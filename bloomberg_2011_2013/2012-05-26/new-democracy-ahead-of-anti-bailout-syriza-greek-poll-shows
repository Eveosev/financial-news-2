Greece â€™s New Democracy party led
Syriza, the anti-bailout party, in voter support, a new opinion
poll showed.  New Democracy had 23.3 percent support in the poll by MRB
pollsters, compared with 22 percent for Syriza, according to a
twitter message from Real News newspaper, which commissioned the
poll. Socialist Pasok, which teamed with New Democracy earlier
this year in an interim government to secure international
financing, had 12.6 percent, according to the poll.  No further details on the survey were immediately
available.  To contact the reporter on this story:
