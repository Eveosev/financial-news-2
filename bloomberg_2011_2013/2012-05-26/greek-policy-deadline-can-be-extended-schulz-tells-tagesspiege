European Parliament President  Martin Schulz  said an extension of the time frame for policy changes
and budget cuts in Greece is “conceivable,” according to an
interview with Tagesspiegel.  Politics “is always a dynamic process,” Schulz told the
German newspaper. The president said agreements on measures
reached between Greece and international financial institutions
should be honored, Tagesspiegel reported.  -- With assistance from  Jeff Black  in Frankfurt. Editors:
