Brazil ’s government will soon release
measures to help reduce loan delinquency rates, Folha de S.Paulo
and UOL said, citing a May 24  interview  with Finance Minister
Guido Mantega.  Consumers will be able to defer tax payments on debt
renegotiated, instead of paying it all in one installment,
Mantega said, according to the interview posted today. The
measure will affect defaulted debts of as much as 100,000 reais
($50,317), he told the Sao Paulo-based newspaper and website.  Mantega expects Brazil to grow 3.5 percent to 4.5 percent
if the international crisis doesn’t worsen, according to Folha
and UOL.  To contact the reporter on this story:
