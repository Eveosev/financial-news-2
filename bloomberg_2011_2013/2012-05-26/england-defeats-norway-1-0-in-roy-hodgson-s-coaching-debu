Ashley Young gave  England  a 1-0 win
over Norway in Roy Hodgson’s first match as manager as the
visitors prepared for next month’s European Championships.  Young scored yesterday in the ninth minute in the match in
Oslo.  The former Liverpool and Fulham coach took over England
after Fabio Capello quit because of disagreements with the
Football Association. Hodgson coached English Premier League
team West Brom until the end of last season.  England begins the European Championships against  France  on
June 11. The event starts June 8 in Poland and the Ukraine,
where the region’s 16 best teams will meet.  To contact the reporter on this story:
