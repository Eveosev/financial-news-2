The U.K. government should appoint a
woman to be the next member of the  Bank of England ’s currently
all-male monetary policy committee, a member of parliament from
the governing coalition told The Times newspaper.  Naming a woman to succeed current member  Adam Posen , who is
leaving in August, would bring fresh perspective on the effects
of monetary policy on people’s lives, Andrea Leadsom, a
Conservative Party member of parliament and a member of the
House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, said.  “When you have a group of white middle-aged men, all of
whom are without doubt incredibly qualified and experienced, the
risk is that they are bringing similar life experiences, similar
backgrounds and similar stages of life to their perspective on
our economy,” Leadsom told the newspaper. “When you have
diversity, you do have much more challenge.”  The nine-member committee has not had a female member since
 Kate Barker  left two years ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
