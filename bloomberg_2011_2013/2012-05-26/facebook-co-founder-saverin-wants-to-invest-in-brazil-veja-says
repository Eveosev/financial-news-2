Eduardo Saverin, a co-founder of
 Facebook Inc. (FB) , wants to invest in Brazil, the country where he
was born, he told  Veja  in an interview in Singapore.  Saverin, who hasnâ€™t yet identified a Brazilian company to
invest in, is seeking something in the technology industry,
according to the Sao Paulo-based magazine.  Eduardo gave up his U.S. citizenship after moving to
Singapore because financial transactions by Americans are more
restricted in the Asian country, his father, Roberto Saverin,
told the magazine.  To contact the reporter on this story:
