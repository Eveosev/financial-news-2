Nicolas Berggruen, the owner of the
Karstadt department-store chain, is one of the two remaining
bidders for German retailer Schlecker,  Sueddeutsche Zeitung 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The other bidder is U.S. private-equity firm Cerberus
Capital Management LP, the German newspaper said. Schlecker’s
creditors have declined offers made so far because the prices
were too low and the concepts weren’t “sophisticated enough,”
Sueddeutsche Zeitung said, citing insolvency administrator Arndt
Geiwitz.  Investors have until June 1 to submit an offer,
Sueddeutsche Zeitung said. A spokesman for Berggruen confirmed
talks had taken place between Berggruen and Geiwitz in the last
few days but declined to comment on any concrete offer or on a
price, the newspaper said. More than 10,000 people would have to
be fired if Schlecker’s 3,200 stores in  Germany  were closed,
Geiwitz told  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .  To contact the reporter on this story:
