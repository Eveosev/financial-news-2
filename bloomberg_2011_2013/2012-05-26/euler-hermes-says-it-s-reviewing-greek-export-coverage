Euler Hermes SA (ELE) , a French-German
trade-credit insurer, said it may reduce its coverage of exports
to  Greece  because of the risk of the country exiting the euro. A
decision is planned before the end of May.  “In light of the recent developments, Euler Hermes will
most probably have to switch to a more prudent approach, also in
the interest of its customers,” spokeswoman Bettina Sattler
said in an e-mailed response to questions. “The outcome of the
new elections in June remains highly uncertain. Consequently,
the situation is further deteriorating. The risk of Greece
exiting the Eurozone has been revived.”  Greeks vote again June 17 after elections May 6 failed to
produce a workable majority in parliament, as parties opposed to
sticking to Greece’s part of an aid agreement with the European
Union made strong inroads.  The credit insurer denied a report in German newspaper Bild
that it has already cut insurance cover for exports to Greece.
“Euler Hermes has maintained a high level of cover for its
customers until today,” Sattler said. “But now we are
confronted with a changing situation.”  Euler Hermes, which was created in 2002 through the merger
of units from  Allianz SE (ALV)  and Assurances Generales de France SA,
said in its 2011 earnings report Feb. 16 that the “world
economy is walking on a tightrope” and that its management has
“prepared for possible scenarios.”  The company, based in Paris and still controlled by Munich-
based Allianz, had gross premiums last year of 2.28 billion
euros ($2.9 billion), up 5.9 percent from the year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
