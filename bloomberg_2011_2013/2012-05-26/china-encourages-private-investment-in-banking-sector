China  will encourage greater private
investment in banks as it seeks to fuel growth in an economy
that’s losing steam and to aid small businesses that are short
of funds.  Qualified companies can buy into lenders through private
stock placements or new share subscriptions, equity transfers or
mergers and acquisitions, according to guidelines released by
the China Banking Regulatory Commission in a statement posted on
its website today. The regulator also said it will encourage
private investment in trust, financial leasing and auto-
financing companies.  The rules aim to “encourage and guide private capital to
enter the banking sector, and support financing in private
investments,” according to the  statement . The regulator also
lowered the minimum shareholding of the main initiator for
village banks to 15 percent from 20 percent.  Premier  Wen Jiabao  said last month China needs to break the
banking “monopoly” of a few big lenders, and could extend the
successful parts of a pilot program in Wenzhou, a city in
Zhejiang province, that allows private financing. The nation’s
efforts to tame inflation and cool the real estate market last
year with lending curbs and higher  interest rates  led to a tight
financing environment, prompting bankruptcies in Wenzhou.  China’s Securities Regulatory Commission said yesterday it
will encourage private investment in securities firms and
futures brokerages, and will modify rules to help privately
owned companies raise capital.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
