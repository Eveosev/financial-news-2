The European Commission is drawing up
plans to allow regulators dealing with banks facing collapse to
write down unsecured bonds and deposits not covered by
guarantees, the Financial Times reported today.  According to draft proposals seen by the paper, regulators
will be allowed to fire the management of a bank that gets into
trouble, restructure it and write down debt not backed by
assets.  Healthy banks may also be required to issue a minimum
amount of debt that can be written off in an emergency, although
national regulators around the European Union will be allowed to
decide how much they should raise, the FT said.  The proposals, set to be unveiled in early June, are aimed
at shifting the burden of bailing out failing banks to
bondholders from taxpayers.  They would also require European Union countries to
establish funds to provide aid in case banks get into trouble.
These would be mainly funded by banks and would include existing
deposit guarantee plans, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
