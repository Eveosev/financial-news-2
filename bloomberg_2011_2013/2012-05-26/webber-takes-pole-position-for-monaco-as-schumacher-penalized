Red Bull’s  Mark Webber  took pole
position for tomorrow’s Monaco Grand Prix as Mercedes’  Michael
Schumacher , who had today’s fastest qualifying time, was
penalized for a crash in the previous race.  Schumacher, the seven-time world champion, qualified in 1
minute, 14.301 seconds. Webber had the next best time, at 1
minute 14.381 seconds.  Schumacher will start in sixth after stewards imposed the
five spot penalty the German was given after a crash in Spain.
Mercedes’ Nico Rosberg will start second, with Lewis Hamilton in
third. Lotus’ Romain Grosjean is fourth, and Ferrari’s  Fernando
Alonso  fifth.  Schumacher came out of retirement for the 2010 season, and
hasn’t been able to achieve the success he was used to. He’s
having his worst start to a season ever, with just two points
from five races. He said he was convinced that he could qualify
well in  Monaco .  “To manage pole position here after what I have gone
through in the past two-and-a-half years is just fabulous,” the
driver said at a press conference. “That’s what sticks in my
mind. I told you guys already in the press conference, my
situation is going to be pole, start the race in sixth and I’m
going to win it. That’s what I’m here for and what I’m going to
aim for. That’s all I gave in min mind and the past doesn’t
matter at all.”  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
