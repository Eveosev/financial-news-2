Real-estate investor  Vincent Tchenguiz  has shrunk his business, cut staff and sold property
in response to an investigation by the U.K. Serious Fraud Office
over the collapse of an Icelandic bank, the Times reported.  “Basically I went into downsizing,” Tchenguiz said in an
interview to the Times. “I had to lay off staff, had to cut
businesses. I sold my house in St. Tropez, cut back from two
speed boats to one. I had 14 cars, now three.”  For Related News and Information:
