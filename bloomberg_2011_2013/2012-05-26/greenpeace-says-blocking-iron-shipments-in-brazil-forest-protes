Greenpeace activists have occupied
cranes in the Brazilian port of Sao Luis to stop a shipment of
 pig iron  in a protest against an amnesty for illegal loggers in
the Amazon jungle, the environmental pressure group said today.  Greenpeace boat the Rainbow Warrior has also pulled
alongside an iron-carrying cargo ship, the Clipper Hope, in the
protest, Greenpeace said in an e-mail. While Brazil’s new forest
code was partially vetoed by President  Dilma Rousseff  yesterday,
it retains a measure to forgive farmers for illegal land
clearing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
