The former  University of Virginia 
lacrosse player convicted in February of second degree murder in
the beating death of his sometimes girlfriend is seeking to
throw out the verdict and get a new trial.  Lawyers for George W. Huguely said in court documents filed
yesterday that a new trial should be held because their client
was deprived of his constitutional right to counsel, the court
failed to disallow certain jurors, certain medical testimony
evidence was limited, and the court made other errors.  A jury of seven men and five women in Charlottesville,
 Virginia , recommended a prison sentence of 25 years for the
crime -- an intentional killing that, unlike first degree
murder, isn’t premeditated. Huguely was found guilty Feb. 22 in
the death of Yeardly Love, a 22-year-old student and athlete at
the university.  Commonwealth Attorney Warner D. Chapman didn’t immediately
return a voice-mail message after regular business hours
yesterday seeking comment on the filing.  The case is Commonwealth of Virginia v. Huguely, 11-00102,
Virginia Circuit Court (Charlottesville).  To contact the reporter on this story:
