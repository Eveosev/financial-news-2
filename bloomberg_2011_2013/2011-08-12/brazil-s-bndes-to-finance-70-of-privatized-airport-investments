Brazil ’s state development bank,
known as BNDES, may finance as much as 70 percent of the
investment needed in airports the government plans to privatize
this year, Civil Aviation Minister Wagner Bittencourt said.  The government plans to auction contracts on Dec. 22 for
private investors to run three airports, in Sao Paulo, Campinas
and Brasilia. The initiative will allow Brazil to expand
capacity and meet rising demand for  air travel  before the 2014
World Cup and Olympic Games in 2016.  “BNDES’s financing will probably be around 70 percent,
since that’s the usual figure in infrastructure projects such as
these ones,” said Bittencourt in an interview yesterday at the
Bloomberg office in  Sao Paulo .  The Brazilian government said about 6 billion reais ($3.7
billion) in investment is needed by 2014 to expand and upgrade
the nation’s 66 main state-owned airports. The three airports
that the government plans to sell account for about 2.6 billion
reais of the investment.  To contact the reporters on this story:
