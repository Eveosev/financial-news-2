The cost of protecting Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from default declined, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  fell 4 basis points to 151 basis points
as of 8:06 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Credit Agricole CIB prices show.
That’s headed for its biggest daily decline since Aug. 9,
according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index dropped 2 basis points to
153 basis points as of 10:06 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole
prices show. That’s down from a two-year high of 155 basis
points yesterday, CMA data show.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index added 1 basis point to 136
basis points as of 9:05 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG prices
show. Five-year swaps on Japan’s sovereign debt rose 1 to 106.5.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporters on this story:
