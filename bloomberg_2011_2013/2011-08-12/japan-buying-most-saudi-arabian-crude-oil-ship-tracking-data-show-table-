Japan  will get the biggest share of
Saudi Arabian  crude oil  cargoes loaded in the week ended Aug. 6,
according to ship-tracking data compiled by Bloomberg.  Tankers with a combined capacity of 1.49 million deadweight
tons, or about 11 million barrels of crude, are sailing to Japan
after loading at Ras Tanura, the worldâ€™s largest oil-export
terminal.  Europe  and the U.S. will get one tanker each, both of
which can carry about 2.2 million barrels of oil, according to
data captured by satellites and shore-based antennae.  Following are the ships and the companies that hired them,
where data are available. Drafts are expressed as a percentage
of maximum sailing depth and are an indication of cargo size.  To contact the reporter on this story:
