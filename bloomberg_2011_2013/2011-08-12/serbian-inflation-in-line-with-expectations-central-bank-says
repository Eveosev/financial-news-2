Serbian inflation was in line with
central bank expectations in July, the National Bank of Serbia
said in a statement.  The July consumer price index fell to 12.1 percent, double
the central bank’s target for the month of 5.1 percent, plus or
minus 1.7 percentage points, the statistics office reported
today. Monthly consumer prices fell 0.5 percent, led by declines
in food prices and health service costs.  The bank, which surprisingly kept its benchmark interest
rate unchanged yesterday citing global risks and potential
fiscal worries at home, expects “annual inflation to continue
falling in the coming months” with the pace of declines
dictated by the new farming season and food prices, according to
the statement.  Global financial turmoil may boost Serbia’s risk premium
and put the dinar under downward pressure, with exports
suffering from weakening demand in traditional export markets,
the Tanjug newswire quoted Governor Dejan Soskic as saying
today.  The bank’s decision to hold rates “provided some support”
for the dinar, “which has been holding well against the euro
despite the volatile environment,” emerging-markets analysts at
 Societe Generale (GLE)  SA said in a note to clients today. The dinar
gained more than 0.5 percent against the euro today, trading at
101.37 at 1:38 p.m. in Belgrade, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
