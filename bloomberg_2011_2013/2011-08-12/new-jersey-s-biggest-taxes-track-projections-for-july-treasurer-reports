New Jersey ’s collections of income,
sales and business taxes, its three biggest revenue generators,
tracked estimates in the first month of its fiscal year,
Treasurer Andrew Sidamon-Eristoff said.  Income-tax receipts were $133 million, less than 1 percent
below forecast. Revenue from sales levies came to $21.9 million,
compared with a projection of $22 million, while collections
from businesses matched a $47 million estimate.  “It’s reassuring that the earliest revenue figures are on
target to meet Treasury Department projections,” Sidamon-
Eristoff said today in a statement.  Total July collections of $335.7 million trailed the $370
million forecast by 9.4 percent, the treasurer said. The figure
for the first month of fiscal 2012 was 34 percent higher than in
July 2010, according to the statement.  Starting with July, the monthly reports reflect only cash
receipts. Previously, the state reported monthly revenue using
an accrual method, which also counted what it expected to
collect, said  Andrew Pratt , a spokesman for the treasurer.  The 9.4 percent decline reflects the drop in cash
collections, not total revenue for July, Pratt said. The state
will still be collecting taxes for the month into September, he
said. Cash collections from inheritance taxes fell short of the
forecast, as did receipts from levies on motor fuels and
financial institutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
