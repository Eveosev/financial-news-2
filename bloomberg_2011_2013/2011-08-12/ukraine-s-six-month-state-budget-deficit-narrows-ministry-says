Ukraine’s six-month state budget
deficit narrowed to 10.96 billion hryvnia ($1.37 billion) as  tax
revenue  rose and the government cut spending, the  Finance
Ministry  said.  The shortfall was more than two times wider in the same
period a year ago, the ministry, based in the capital, Kiev,
said today in a statement on its  website . Tax revenue jumped to
153.7 billion hryvnia in the January-June period, compared with
112.3 billion a year earlier, it said.  The government is seeking to limit the full-year deficit to
2.7 percent of gross domestic product to meet the conditions of
a $15.6 billion bailout loan from the  International Monetary
Fund .  To contact the reporters on this story:
