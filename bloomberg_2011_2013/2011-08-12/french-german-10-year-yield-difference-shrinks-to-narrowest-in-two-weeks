French bonds rose relative to
benchmark German bunds for a second day, reducing the additional
yield investors demand to hold the securities to the least in
more than two weeks, based on closing market rates.  The difference in yield, or spread, narrowed 8.5 basis
points to 64.9 basis points as of 10:52 a.m. in  London . Thatâ€™s
the least since July 28, based on closing rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
