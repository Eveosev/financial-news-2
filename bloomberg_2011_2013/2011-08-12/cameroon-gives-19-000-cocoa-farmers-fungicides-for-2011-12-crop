Cocoa growers in  Cameroon , Africa’s
fourth-biggest producer of the beans, received fungicide and
other equipment worth 80 million CFA francs ($173,744) amid
plans to increase output in the 2011-12 crop harvest.  More than 19,000 farmers in the Center region got the
chemicals and sprayers to apply to their trees on 57,221
hectares (141,396 acres) of farm land, said Emerand Evenga,
communication officer at the Ministry of Agriculture, in an
interview in the capital, Yaounde, today.  Cocoa production climbed to 229,040 metric tons in the
season, which started in August 2010, to June 30, compared with
a 2009-10 total output of 198,000 tons, according to the Cocoa
and Coffee Board.  Ivory Coast , Ghana and  Nigeria  are Africa’s three largest
cocoa producers. The continent accounts for 68 percent of world
output, according to the International Cocoa Organization.  To contact the reporter on this story:
