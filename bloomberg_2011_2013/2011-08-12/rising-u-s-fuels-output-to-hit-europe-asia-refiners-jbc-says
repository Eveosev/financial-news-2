U.S. refiners may start exporting
more fuels as refinery processing rates rose to close to the
highest level in a year, JBC Energy GmbH said.  Oil companies  were operating at 90 percent of capacity in
the week to Aug. 5, according to Department of Energy data.
Operating rates advanced to the most in a year on July 15 at
90.3 percent. Refiners are benefitting from the discount in U.S.
crude relative to London-traded Brent.  The crude discount is the “key reason behind soaring U.S.
refinery run rates even as domestic demand remains lacklustre,”
analysts led by Vienna-based David Wech said today in a report.
“The natural result of this is a massive increase in U.S.
exports of refined products, much to the woe of European and
Asian refiners.”  The gap between front-month Brent on ICE Futures Europe
Exchange and West Texas Intermediate on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was $22.77 a barrel today, down from a record close of
$23.79 on Aug. 10, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
