Oil options volatility extended its
decline as underlying futures fell following a report that U.S.
consumer confidence plunged in August to the lowest level in
three decades.  Implied volatility for at-the-money options expiring in
September, a measure of expected price swings in futures and a
gauge of options prices, was 41.22 percent as of 4 p.m. in  New
York , down from 41.41 percent yesterday. It had been as high as
75.7 earlier this week as markets gyrated.  Crude for September delivery fell 34 cents to settle at
$85.38 a barrel on the  New York Mercantile Exchange .  Three of the four most active options in electronic trading
today were puts, which gain value as futures prices decline.  The most active contract was September $80 puts, with 4,170
lots changing hands as of 3:43 p.m. They rose 3 cents to 51
cents a barrel. September $90 calls, the next-most active
option, lost 26 cents to 20 cents a barrel with 3,329 lots
trading. One contract covers 1,000 barrels of crude.  The exchange distributes real-time data for electronic
trading and releases information on floor trading, where the
bulk of options trading occurs, the next business day.  September $85 calls were the most active options traded
yesterday, with 7,123 lots changing hands. They rose 93 cents to
$2.36 a barrel. The next-most active options, October $60 puts,
declined 23 cents to 15 cents a barrel on volume of 6,293 lots.  Open interest was highest for December $100 calls with
46,937 contracts. Next were December $120 calls with 44,079 lots
and December $70 puts with 41,853.  To contact the reporter on this story:
