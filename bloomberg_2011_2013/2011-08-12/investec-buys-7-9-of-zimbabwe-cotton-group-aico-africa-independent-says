South Africa ’s Investec Asset
Management bought 7.9 percent of  Zimbabwe ’s  Aico Africa Ltd. (AICO)  for
an estimated $10.3 million, the  Zimbabwe Independent  said,
citing people it didn’t identify at Terra Partners and Lynton-
Edwards stockbrokers.  The deal, finalized last week, makes Investec one of the 10
largest investors in Zimbabwe, the Harare-based newspaper said
on its website. Aico is sub-Saharan Africa’s biggest cotton
buyer and ginner, processing at least half of Zimbabwe’s crop,
the Independent said.  Aico was formerly known as Cottco Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
