Canadian natural gas fell as
American production stayed near record levels and normal
temperatures were forecast for most of the U.S., curbing demand
for the power-plant fuel.  Canadian gas prices, which usually follow their U.S.
counterparts on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , dropped 1.3
percent as U.S. production was about 62 billion cubic feet a
day, according to Eric Bickel, an analyst at Summit Energy
Services Inc. in Louisville, Kentucky. MDA EarthSat Weather of
Gaithersburg, Maryland, said most of the U.S. besides  Texas  and
the Southern Plains will have seasonal to cool weather until
Aug. 16.  “We are still producing at a record level,” Bickel said
in a telephone interview. “Longer term this market is still
well-supplied and demand doesn’t seem to be coming back in.”  Alberta  gas for September delivery declined 4.5 cents to
C$3.47 per gigajoule ($3.32 per million British thermal units)
as of 3:05 p.m.  New York  time, according to  NGX , a Canadian
Internet market. Gas traded on the exchange goes to users in
 Canada  and the U.S. and is priced on  TransCanada Corp. (TRP) ’s Alberta
system.  In New York, natural gas for September delivery fell 4.8
cents to settle at $4.06 per million Btu.  Gas Flows  Volume on TransCanada’s Alberta system, which collects the
output of most of the nation’s gas wells, was 15.7 billion cubic
feet as of 1:30 p.m. in New York.  Gas was flowing at a daily rate of 2.62 billion cubic feet
at Empress, Alberta, where the fuel is transferred to
TransCanada’s main line.  At McNeil, Saskatchewan, where gas is transferred to the
Northern Border Pipeline for shipment to the Chicago area, the
daily flow rate was 1.87 billion cubic feet.  Available capacity on TransCanada’s British Columbia system
at Kingsgate was 1.06 billion cubic feet. The system was
forecast to carry 1.53 billion cubic feet today, about 59
percent of its capacity of 2.58 billion.  Gas at the Alliance Pipeline delivery point near  Chicago 
rose 7.53 cents, or 1.8 percent, to $4.2194 per million Btu as
of 1:33 p.m. New York time on the Intercontinental Exchange.
Alliance is an express line that can carry 1.5 billion cubic
feet a day to the Midwest from western Canada.  At the Kingsgate point on the border of  Idaho  and British
Columbia, gas gained 9.82 cents, or 2.6 percent, to $3.884.  To contact the reporter on this story:
