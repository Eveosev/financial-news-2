Kenya  plans to award its first ever
gold-mining license in October to  Goldplat Plc (GDP) , Business Daily
reported, citing Commissioner of Mines Moses Masibo.  The permit will allow the London-listed company to exploit
gold deposits estimated to be worth 60 billion shillings ($642
million) a year in the Kilimapesa area of Narok County, south of
the capital, Nairobi, the newspaper said. Kenyaâ€™s government
will earn 4 percent of the value of gold exported, it said.  The license is being awarded in October to allow a 90-day
period for members of the public to lodge any objections, the
newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
