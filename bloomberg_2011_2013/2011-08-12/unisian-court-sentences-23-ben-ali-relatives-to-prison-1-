A Tunisian court sentenced 23
relatives of former President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali and his
wife, Leila Trabelsi, to jail terms ranging from four months to
six years.  The nine women and 14 men were found guilty of attempts to
escape from the country illegally and possession of foreign
currency, Judge Fouzi Jbeli announced in Tunis today. Among them
are three of Trabelsiâ€™s siblings and a nephew of Ben Ali. The
defendants were also ordered to pay fines exceeding 200 million
dinars ($145 million) in total.  Jbeli also dismissed charges lodged against Ali Seriati,
the former head of presidential security, which included forging
passports to help relatives of Ben Ali and his wife escape from
the country with money and jewelry.  To contact the reporter on this story:
