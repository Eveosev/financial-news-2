The cost of protecting sovereign and
corporate bonds from default rose, reversing an earlier decline,
according to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of swaps on 15
governments was up 3 basis points to 292 at 8 a.m. in London. A
decline signals improvement in perceptions of  credit quality .  Contracts on the Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of 40
companies with mostly high-yield credit ratings increased 3.5
basis points to 658.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. The
index is a benchmark for the cost of protecting bonds against
default and a decline signals improved perceptions of credit
quality.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of 125 companies with
investment-grade ratings rose 1.5 basis points to 157 basis
points.  The Markit iTraxx Financial Index linked to the senior debt
of 25 banks and insurers trimmed its early decline, dropping 2
basis points to 239, while the subordinated index was down 5 at
410, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
