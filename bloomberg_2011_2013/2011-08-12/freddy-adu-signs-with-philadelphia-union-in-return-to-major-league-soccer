Freddy Adu, who was offered a
contract with  Italy ’s Inter Milan when he was 11 and signed an
endorsement deal with  Nike Inc. (NKE)  at age 13, signed with the
Philadelphia Union, returning to  Major League Soccer  on a free
transfer from  Europe .  It’s the latest move in the career of a player once touted
as the future of American soccer who has bounced around European
leagues and stayed on the bench this week as the U.S. national
team played its first game under coach Jurgen Klinsmann.  The Union and Benfica, the 22-year-old midfielder’s
Portuguese club, agreed on the transfer, and Adu has signed, the
MLS team said today on  its website . The team didn’t reveal
financial details of Adu’s contract, citing league policy.  Adu was the No. 1 pick in the 2004 MLS draft and made his
debut with D.C. United that year at age 14 as the youngest
player on a major U.S. professional team in more than 115 years,
according to the Union. The Nike contract that he signed prior
to his debut was worth $1 million, the Washington Post reported.
In 2006, the same year he had a practice stint with  Manchester
United  of the English Premier League, Adu made $550,000, fifth-
most in the league, according to the newspaper.  Adu appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated in 2003 and
2004 and was the  Electronic Arts Inc. (ERTS) ’s “FIFA Soccer 06” cover
athlete. He scored 11 goals and added 17 assists in 87
appearances with D.C. United under current Union coach Peter Nowak, and in 2006 transferred to Real Salt Lake, where he
scored twice in 11 games.  European Trip  In 2007 his rights were secured by Benfica. Adu scored
twice in 11 games with the 32-time winners of the Portuguese
Premier League, and played on loan for four other European
clubs, including  AS Monaco , before re-joining the MLS.  On Jan. 22, 2006, Adu made his U.S. national team debut at
age 16, the youngest player in team history. Adu has represented
the U.S. in u-17 competition, U-20 competition and in the 2008
 Olympic Games  in Beijing, also under Nowak.  Adu, who was born in Ghana and immigrated to Maryland at
age 8, has made 17 appearances on the national team, playing
most recently in the team’s 4-2 loss to  Mexico  on June 25 in the
Gold Cup final. He didn’t play in the team’s 1-1 draw with
Mexico earlier this week.  The Union are 8-5-9 this year, in second place in the
Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at PPL Park in
Chester,  Pennsylvania .  To contact the reporter on this story:
