Turkish stocks sank, led by banks
and the country’s second-largest holding company, which
retreated from a late surge in the final minutes of trading
yesterday.  The benchmark Istanbul National 100 Index fell 1,096.91, or
2.1 percent, to 50,920.11 at 10:22 a.m. The banking index lost
2.1 percent.  Turkiye Garanti Bankasi AS (GARAN) , the country’s largest listed
company, led the decline, losing 18 kurus, or 2.98 percent, to
5.86 liras. Second was  Haci Omer Sabanci Holding AS (SAHOL)  ,
which surged in the final minutes of trading yesterday to the
maximum 11 percent gain permitted in a session. The shares
plunged as much as 7.5 percent to 5.4 liras today.  “When you look at the combined intra-day charts of the
ISE100, you will see something similar to a histogram recording
a 7.5 magnitude earthquake,” Istanbul-based Ata Invest said in
e-mailed comments. “Reason: wild volatility driven by fear and
low (no) conviction.”  Yesterday, Turkey’s stock market reversed direction several
times before closing 3.4 percent up.  To contact the reporter on this story:
