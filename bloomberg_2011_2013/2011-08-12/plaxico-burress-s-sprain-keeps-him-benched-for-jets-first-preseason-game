Plaxico Burress will miss the New
York Jets’ preseason opener against the Houston Texans to give
the wide receiver more time to recover from an ankle sprain,
coach  Rex Ryan  said.  Burress, who hasn’t played in the  National Football League 
for the past two years after accidentally shooting himself in
the leg at a Manhattan night club, won’t accompany the team to
Houston for the Aug. 15 game.  “The number one reason is they think the altitude when
you’re flying there, that could increase swelling,” Ryan said
yesterday during a news conference. “We want him at 100
percent; it’s recommended that he doesn’t fly.”  Burress, who signed with the Jets on July 31 after a 20-
month prison term on a gun charge, rolled his ankle last week
while running drills with fellow Jets receiver  Santonio Holmes .
Ryan said Burress should return to practice with his teammates
Aug. 17 after a series of treatments.  “Plaxico’s in really good shape,” Ryan said. “Is there
any ring rust? Doesn’t seem to be. He catches the ball great. We
have all seen him catch it. He looks good to me.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
