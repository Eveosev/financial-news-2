Mattel Inc. (MAT)  said in a court filing
that it will appeal a judge’s award of punitive damages and fees
to MGA Entertainment Inc., the maker of Bratz dolls.  Mattel said it will ask the U.S. Court of Appeals in  San
Francisco  to review an Aug. 4 ruling awarding MGA $225 million
in punitive damages, attorney fees and costs. That ruling by
U.S. District Judge  David Carter  in Santa Ana, California,
brought the total award in the trial over the doll’s origins to
$310 million.  A jury in April agreed with closely held MGA that El
Segundo, California-based Mattel stole its trade secrets when
company employees got into MGA’s showrooms at toy fairs using
phony business cards.  The jurors awarded MGA $3.4 million for each of 26
instances in which they found Mattel misappropriated a trade
secret, a total of $88.4 million. In August, Carter lowered the
jury award to $85 million.  The jury rejected a claim that MGA stole Mattel’s trade
secrets in 2000 when it made an agreement with  Carter Bryant , a
toy designer. Mattel said Bryant was working for it when he came
up with the idea for the Bratz dolls and made the first
sketches.  The case is Bryant v. Mattel, 04-09049, U.S. District
Court, Central District of California (Santa Ana).  To contact the reporter on this story:
