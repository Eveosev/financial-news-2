Two Kenyans asked the  International
Criminal Court  for a postponement in their pre-trial hearing on
charges of crimes against humanity, the  Daily Nation  said,
citing their lawyer.  Kenyan lawmaker William Ruto and radio presenter Joshua
Arap Sang yesterday filed an application at the Hague-based
court for a six-week extension to mid-October, giving them time
to prepare their case, the Nairobi-based newspaper reported
today, citing Katwa Kigen.  The defendants, along with legislator Henry Kosgey, are due
in court between Sept. 1 and Sept. 20 for a hearing to decide
whether they will stand trial for suspected involvement in the
country’s post election violence in 2008, the newspaper said. A
second case involving Finance Minister  Uhuru Kenyatta  and two
other senior government officials is scheduled to run from Sept.
21 to Oct. 11, it said.  An estimated 1,500 people died and 300,000 were displaced
in clashes ignited by a disputed December 2007 presidential
election in East Africa’s largest economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
