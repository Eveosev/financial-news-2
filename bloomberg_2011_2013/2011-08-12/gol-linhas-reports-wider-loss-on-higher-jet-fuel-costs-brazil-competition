Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4) ,
 Brazil ’s second-largest airline, posted a wider second-quarter
loss as fuel costs surged and sales dropped.  The net loss expanded to 358.7 million reais ($220 million)
in the three months ended June 30, from 51.9 million reais a
year earlier, Sao Paulo-based Gol said in a statement yesterday.
Sales fell to 1.57 billion reais from 1.59 billion reais.  Gol is suffering from increased competition for passengers
in  Latin America ’s biggest economy and a surge in fuel costs
that has led Singapore Airlines Ltd. and Air France-KLM Group to
pare growth. The Brazilian carrier, which last month slashed its
earnings forecast for the second time this year, is targeting
cost cuts of 650 million reais to offset increases in fuel
costs.  The carrier also announced a share buyback to boost its
stock, which slumped 59 percent this year through yesterday,
compared with a 29 percent slide at larger rival Tam SA. Gol
fell 4.6 percent to 9.87 reais at 10:02 a.m. New York time in
Sao Paulo trading.  Gol will buy back up to 9.5 million shares, about 10
percent of outstanding preferred shares in the market, according
to the statement. The stock will be held in the treasury and
either canceled or resold, the company said.  Jet fuel prices have surged 40 percent in the past year,
according to New York prices compiled by Bloomberg.  Gol’s fuel costs, the biggest expense for the airline,
soared 28 percent last quarter to 731 million reais, according
to the statement.  To contact the reporters on this story:
