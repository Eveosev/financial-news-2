The Philippine peso declined for a
second week on concern income sent home by overseas Filipino
workers may slow as the global economy cools.  The currency reached a three-week low on Aug. 9 after
 Standard & Poor’s  downgraded its AAA rating for the U.S. last
week and  Europe ’s debt crisis deepened. Remittances, which are
equivalent to more than 10 percent of the economy, rose 6.9
percent in May from a year earlier, the central bank said last
month. Data for June are due Aug. 15.  “For the Philippines, in terms of the currency, it’s been
in a very tight range,” said Saktiandi Supaat, head of foreign-
exchange research at Malayan Banking Bhd. in  Singapore . “A
slowdown in remittances poses some downside risk to growth.”  The peso fell 0.2 percent to 42.640 per dollar at the 4 p.m.
close in  Manila , according to Tullett Prebon Plc. The currency
dropped 0.1 percent this week. It touched 42.770 on Aug. 9, the
weakest level since July 20.  The yield on the 7 percent bonds due April 2016 declined 22
basis points, or 0.22 percentage point, to 4.915 percent this
week, according to prices from Tradition Financial Services. The
rate fell two basis points today.  The  Philippines  doesn’t plan to conduct any global bond
exchanges or debt offers while financial markets are “too
volatile,” Finance Secretary Cesar Purisima said yesterday.
“We’re waiting to see until the market stabilizes. Clearly, now
is not the right time.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
