Serbia’s risk premium and the dinar
may come under pressure if the global financial turmoil spreads,
with exports suffering from weakening demand in traditional
markets,  Tanjug  news agency quoted central bank Governor Dejan Soskic as saying.  The impact of the spreading crisis is “predictable” and
while economic activity may slow, there are no “serious”
challenges to financial stability, Soskic said, according to
Tanjug.  One of the risks lies in a potential increase in non-
performing loans and the central bank is “carefully
monitoring” bad debt, Soskic said, adding that some bank
supervision and monetary-policy measures may have to be
postponed until the “situation stabilizes” to avoid generating
“additional risks.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
