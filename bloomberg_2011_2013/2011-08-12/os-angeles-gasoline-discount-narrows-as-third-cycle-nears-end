California-blend gasoline in  Los
Angeles  strengthened the most in seven weeks as scheduling for
the third cycle of the month neared an end.  The discount for prompt-delivery Carbob in Los Angeles
narrowed 7 cents to 8.75 cents a gallon versus gasoline futures
traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 4:20 p.m. East
Coast time today. That’s the narrowest gap since July 5.  “The market seemed to be moving up all day long,” said
Randy Simpson, vice president of supply and trading at Idemitsu
Apollo Corp. in Sacramento, California. “Refineries are
scheduling, there’s a lot of tenders flying around and Monday
starts fourth-cycle scheduling.”  Carbob’s discount in  San Francisco  narrowed 6.75 cents to
6.25 cents versus futures.  “The cycling is probably the only thing that would account
for this,” said Paul Lee, who manages clients for gasoline
wholesaler Coast Oil Co. in San Jose, California.  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  was said to have shut two compressors
associated with a hydrocracker at its refinery in Torrance,
California, earlier this week.  Barbara Burgett, a spokeswoman for Exxon, said the plant is
now operating normally.  Chevron Corp. (CVX)  is also said to be performing work on a
naphtha hydrotreater at its plant in El Segundo until Aug. 20.  To contact the reporter on this story:
