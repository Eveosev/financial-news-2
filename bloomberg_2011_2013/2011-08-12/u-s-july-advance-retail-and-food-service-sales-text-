Following is the text of the monthly
retail sales report from the Commerce Department.  ADVANCE MONTHLY SALES FOR RETAIL AND FOOD SERVICES  JULY 2011  The U.S. Census Bureau announced today that advance estimates of
U.S. retail and food services sales for July, adjusted for
seasonal variation and holiday and trading-day differences, but
not for price changes, were $390.4 billion, an increase of 0.5
percent from the previous month, and 8.5 percent above July 2010.
Total sales for the May through July 2011 period were up 8.2
percent from the same period a year ago. The May to June 2011
percent change was revised from +0.1 percent to +0.3 percent.  Retail trade sales were up 0.5 percent from June 2011, and 8.9
percent above last year. Gasoline stations sales were up 23.6
percent from July 2010 and nonstore retailers sales were up 14.1
percent from last year.  The advance estimates are based on a subsample of the Census
Bureau's full retail and food services sample. A stratified
random sampling method is used to select approximately 5,000
retail and food services firms whose sales are then weighted and
benchmarked to represent the complete universe of over three
million retail and food services firms. Responding firms account
for approximately 65% of the MARTS dollar volume estimate.  SOURCE: U.S. Commerce Department      http://www.census.gov/retail   To contact the reporter on this story:
