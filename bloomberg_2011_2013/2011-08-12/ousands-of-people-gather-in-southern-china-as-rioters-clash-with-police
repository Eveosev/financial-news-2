Thousands of people gathered in
southern  China â€™s Guizhou province as crowds attacked police
officers and burned vehicles following a dispute between a
driver and a city management officer.  People rallied in front of the Qianxi county government
building at 5 p.m. local time yesterday after the city officer
had a confrontation with the driver who had allegedly illegally
parked a vehicle, state-run Xinhua News Agency said today,
citing the command center of the provincial public security
department.  A woman was injured during the dispute, Hexun.com  reported 
today, citing China National Radio, prompting crowds to block
roads with trucks and forklifts. People turned over government
vehicles and 10 vehicles were smashed and five set alight, the
Xinhua report said.  More than 10 police officers and security staff were
injured during the clash and 10 suspects who allegedly attacked
and burned vehicles were detained, according to Xinhua. The
crowds dispersed at 3 a.m. today, it said.  Riots, strikes and protests are increasing as  income
inequality  grows and real estate prices soar. China spent more
on domestic security than on national defense last year,
according to the  Finance Ministry .  Last month, at least 200 protesters in Guizhou province
staged a demonstration after a one-legged vendor was beaten to
death by local officials following a dispute.  Demonstrators in central Hubei province clashed with police
in June after a local councilman died in police custody as he
was being questioned over bribery allegations. Armored cars were
used to quell protests.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
