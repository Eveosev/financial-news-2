Slovakiaâ€™s inflation rate fell for a
second month to 3.7 percent in July from 3.9 percent in the
previous month, the statistics office said.  Consumer prices dropped 0.1 percent on the month after
being unchanged in June, the office said in a statement today in
Bratislava, Slovakia. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey
of four economists was for an inflation rate of 3.9 percent and
monthly price growth of 0.1 percent.  The inflation slowdown was led by food prices, which fell
1.2 percent from June, followed by a 0.3 percent drop in prices
of clothing and shoes. Rising the most were prices of health
care, which were up 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
