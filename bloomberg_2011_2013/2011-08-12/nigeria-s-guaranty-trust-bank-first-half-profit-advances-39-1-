Guaranty Trust Bank Plc (GUARANTY) ,  Nigeria ’s
second-biggest lender by market value, said first-half net
income rose 39 percent.  Profit advanced to 25.3 billion naira ($164 million) from
18.2 billion naira a year earlier. Revenue rose to 91.84 billion
naira, from 82.96 billion naira, the Lagos-based lender said in
a statement published today on the website of the  Nigerian Stock
Exchange  after the end of trading.  “Guaranty Trust Bank is still one of our favorite picks
due to strong liquidity and capital positions, and these results
are more or less in line with expectation,” Securities Africa
Trading said in a note e-mailed to clients today. Guaranty “has
not been immune to the 2011 sell-off in the banking sector yet
it has proved more resilient than most.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
