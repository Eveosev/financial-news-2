U.S. stocks pared gains after a
gauge of  consumer confidence  trailed economists’ estimates.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.3 percent to
1,176.21 at 10 a.m. in New York after rallying as much as 1.4
percent earlier. The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained 76.67
points, or 0.7 percent, to 11,219.98.     The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
August index of consumer sentiment fell to 54.9 from 63.7 a
month earlier, the group reported today. The median forecast of
69 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News projected a reading of
62. Estimates ranged from 59 to 66.5. The index averaged 89 in
the five years leading up to the recession that began in
December 2007.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
