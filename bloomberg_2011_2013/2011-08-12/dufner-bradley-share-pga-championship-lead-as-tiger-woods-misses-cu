Jason Dufner  and Keegan Bradley are
tied for the lead at golf’s U.S. PGA Championship, where Tiger
Woods missed the cut for weekend play in a major tournament for
the third time as a professional.  Dufner and Bradley are 5-under-par through 36 holes at
Atlanta Athletic Club in Johns Creek, Georgia.  D.A. Points,  Jim Furyk ,  Steve Stricker , John Senden and
Scott Verplank are tied for third place at 4-under par at the
season’s final major championship.  Woods finished 10-over par, six shots off the projected cut
line for weekend play. It would be the first time Woods has
failed to make the cut in 14 appearances at the PGA
Championship, where he has won the title four times. The missed
cut would be the first for Woods at one of golf’s four majors
since the 2009 British Open.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
