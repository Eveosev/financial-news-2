Asian stocks gained, paring the MSCI
Asia Pacific Index’s weekly loss, and metals rose, led by
copper, after an unexpected drop in U.S. jobless claims and
higher-than-estimated earnings tempered concern the economy is
slowing as  Europe ’s debt crisis widens.  The MSCI Asia Pacific gained 0.5 percent to 122.69 at 9:16
a.m. in  Tokyo , trimming its loss for the week to 2.6 percent.
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures slid 0.4 percent after the
gauge jumped 4.6 percent yesterday. Thirty-year Treasuries
advanced, paring some of yesterday’s loss. Copper rose 1
percent, zinc climbed for a fourth day, while gold retreated.  Asian stocks are recovering after falling as much as 13
percent since Aug. 1 amid concern about Europe’s debt crisis and
a political battle over the U.S. debt ceiling. Data yesterday
showed first-time applications for U.S. jobless benefits
decreased, while a report today may show retail sales increased
by the most in four months. Regulators in  France , Spain, Italy
and Belgium will impose bans on short-selling from today to
stabilize markets after European banks plunged.  -- Editor: Shiyin Chen  To contact the reporter on this story:
