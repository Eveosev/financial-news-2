Poland ’s grain production and
quality will decline this year because of heavy rain in the past
weeks, Agriculture Minister Marek Sawicki said.  “This year’s harvest is one of the most difficult in more
than a decade,” Sawicki said in an e-mailed comment. “The
quality of grain is much worse because of rainfall, this
regarding both the consumption and feed grain.”  The wheat harvest in Poland, the European Union’s fourth-
largest grower of the grain, usually starts in July. Last year
the output of the so-called basic grains, excluding corn, was
25.5 million metric tons compared with 28 million tons in 2009,
according to the country’s statistics office.  “Output will be lower than last year, though a lot will
depend on the weather in the coming days,” Sawicki said.
“Unfortunately, for the moment the forecast is not promising.
Eastern Poland suffered the most from bad weather conditions and
the harvest in that region has been delayed by at least three
weeks.”  Eastern Poland received between 120 to 150 millimeters
(4.7 to 5.9 inches) more rain in July than normal, data from the
EU’s Monitoring Agricultural Resources unit shows. France,
 Germany  and the U.K. are the top producers in the 27-nation EU,
according to data from the bloc.  To contact the reporters on this story:
