Tyson Foods Inc. (TSN) , the largest U.S.
meat producer, is adjusting the weight of chickens raised at
some of its farms as domestic inventories increase and feed
costs rise.  “We’re making some adjustments in the weight of the birds
we’re producing at some of our complexes,” Worth Sparkman, a
spokesman for the Springdale, Arkansas company, said today in an
e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News. “We’ve
recently held a series of meetings with contract poultry farmers
in some of our complexes to talk about adjustments we’re making
in operations in response to changing market conditions.”  Tyson uses contract growers to raise poultry of different
sizes and is reducing the weight of its “big birds,” which may
weigh as much as eight pounds, because of higher corn prices,
Chief Executive Officer Donald Smith said on a conference call
with analysts on Aug. 8.  The company, which also processes beef and pork, had
operating income of $28 million in its chicken unit for the
fiscal third quarter. Smith said the chicken segment likely will
post a fourth-quarter loss.  Frozen chicken inventories  have
risen 13 percent while the price of breast meat has dropped.  Most-active corn futures in  Chicago  have risen 69 percent
in the last year to almost $7.15 a bushel. Corn and soybean meal
represented 42 percent of Tyson’s cost of raising live chickens
in fiscal 2010, according to a securities  filing .  To contact the reporter on this story:
