French economic growth unexpectedly
stalled in the second quarter from the previous three months, 
when it expanded 0.9 percent, French statistics institute Insee 
said today in Paris.  Economists had expected gross domestic product to expand 
0.3 percent, according to the median of 15 forecasts in a 
Bloomberg News survey. The euro regionâ€™s second-biggest economy 
grew 1.6 percent in the second quarter compared with the same 
period a year earlier, down from a revised 2.1 percent annual 
growth in the first three months, Insee said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
