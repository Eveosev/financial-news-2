The Hungarian central bank may
support the economy with a “much-needed” interest-rate cut if
the Swiss central bank decides to stop the franc’s appreciation
by pegging it to the euro, according to  RBC Capital Markets .  “Rumors of a possible euro-franc peg could be very
positive for central and eastern Europe, particularly for the
forint and zloty given their sizeable franc liabilities,” Nigel Rendell, an RBC strategist in  London , wrote in an e-mail to
clients today. “It could allow Hungarian policy makers leeway
to deliver a much-needed rate cut.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
