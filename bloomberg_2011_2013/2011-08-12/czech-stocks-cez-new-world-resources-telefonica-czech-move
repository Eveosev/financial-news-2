The Czech Republic’s PX stock gauge
advanced for a second day, rising 0.9 percent to 996 as of 2:50
p.m. in Prague.  The following are among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  CEZ AS (CEZ)  , the country’s largest power producer, rose
1.5 percent to 761 koruna, ending a five-day drop. The utility
industry in central  Europe  was increased to “overweight” from
“neutral” at ING Groep NV, which cited strong company finances
and a recent decline in stock prices. Electricity for next-year
delivery in neighboring  Germany , where CEZ exports part of its
output, rose for a second day.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the biggest Czech coking-
coal producer, advanced 3.1 percent to 164 koruna, wiping out
yesterday’s 1.9 percent retreat. Europe’s benchmark coal
derivatives rose to the highest in a week in Amsterdam.  Telefonica Czech Republic AS (SPTT CP) fell 0.9 percent to
401.4 koruna. The country’s largest phone operator earlier
