Aditya Agarwal, a director at  Emami
Ltd. (HMN) , an Indian maker of skincare products and traditional pain
balms, comments on new products and expansion plans for the
company’s edible-oil business.  He spoke in an interview in Kolkata yesterday, where the
company is based.  “We expect group sales of about 50 billion rupees in the
financial year started April 1, from 37 billion rupees now. Our
key growth drivers will be the edible-oil and FMCG businesses.  ‘‘We plan to invest 5 billion rupees to expand edible-oil
capacity to 3,500 tons per day from 1,000 tons now. Money will
be raised through debt and internal cash generation.  ‘‘Sales from the edible-oil business may more than double
to 35 billion rupees in the financial year ending March 2013,
from 15 billion rupees now.  ‘‘We also plan to introduce more personal-care products and
foray into the ready-to-eat foods category like biscuits and
snacks in the next 2 to 3 years.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
