Federal regulations  announced today
lay out the circumstances under which the U.S. will subsidize
health coverage for the 24 million people expected to buy
policies in marketplaces called exchanges starting in 2014.  The rules also determine criteria for qualifying for an
expansion of Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance
program for the poor, which will expand its enrollment by
another 16 million people under the health-care overhaul.  To contact the reporter on this story:
