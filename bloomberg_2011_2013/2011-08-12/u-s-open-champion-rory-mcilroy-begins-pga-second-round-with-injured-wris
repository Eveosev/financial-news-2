U.S. Open champion  Rory McIlroy  teed
off to start the second round of the PGA Championship at the
Atlanta Athletic Club a day after injuring his right wrist and
considering quitting the year’s final major golf tournament.  McIlroy, from  Northern Ireland , had his wrist taped this
morning when he stepped to the tee. He sent his drive down the
middle of the fairway and was able to keep both hands on the
club, something he often couldn’t do after injuring his wrist
when he struck a root while hitting a 7-iron on the third hole
yesterday.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
