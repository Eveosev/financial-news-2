OAO Rosneft halted a distillation
unit at its Komsomolsk oil refinery in  Russia ’s Far East this
week for maintenance.  The unit known as E-AVT-3 halted on Aug. 10 and is
scheduled to start operating on Sept. 11, according to data from
the Energy Ministry’s CDU-TEK unit. CDU-TEK collates information
gathered from  oil companies  operating in Russia.  The Komsomolsk facility can process 8 million metric ton of
crude a year, according to Rosneft. That’s about 160,000 barrels
a day.  --Raj Rajendran, Alessandro Vitelli.  To contact the reporter on this story:
