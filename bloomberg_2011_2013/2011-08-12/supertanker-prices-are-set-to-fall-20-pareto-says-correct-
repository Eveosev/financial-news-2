(Corrects names of securities firm and analyst starting in
headline.)  Prices of secondhand supertankers
probably are set to drop as much as 20 percent, Pareto
Securities ASA said.  Very large crude carriers, as the ships are also known,
will likely sell for $40 million or less, Oslo-based analyst
Martin Korsvold said in an e-mailed report today, adding owners’
bids below that figure. Brokers are assessing the ships’ worth
at $47 million, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
