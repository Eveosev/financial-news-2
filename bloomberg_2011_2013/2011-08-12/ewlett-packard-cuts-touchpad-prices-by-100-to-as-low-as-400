Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  has cut prices
of TouchPad tablet computers by $100 one month after introducing
the product, a move that may help the company compete with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s market-leading iPad.  TouchPads  cost  $399.99 for a 16-gigabyte model and $499.99
for a 32-gigabyte version, according to Hewlett-Packard’s
website. The  Palo Alto , California-based company said in a June
9  statement  it would charge $499.99 for 16 gigabytes and $599.99
for 32 gigabytes.  Hewlett-Packard in July introduced the TouchPad into a
market dominated by the iPad, which generated $6 billion in
sales in the most recent quarter. Price reductions make the
TouchPad $100 less expensive than comparable iPad 2 models,
which may help the HP tablets draw customers from Apple, said
Brian Marshall, an analyst at Gleacher & Co.  “Lowering prices is a decent way to stimulate demand,”
said Marshall, who is based in  San Francisco  and has a $50 price
target for Hewlett-Packard shares. Hewlett-Packard should have
priced the TouchPad below the iPad when it introduced the tablet
last month, Marshall said. “To have a product that’s new to the
market come out at the same level as the iPad offerings doesn’t
make much sense.”  Hewlett-Packard’s shares gained $1.27, or 4.1 percent, to
$32.32 at 4 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has
dropped 23 percent this year.  Hewlett-Packard said in an e-mailed statement that it
“continually evaluates pricing for its products and is pleased
to permanently extend its back-to-school promotion on the HP
TouchPad.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
