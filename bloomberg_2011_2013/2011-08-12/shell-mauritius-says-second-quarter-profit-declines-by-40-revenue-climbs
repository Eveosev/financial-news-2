Shell Mauritius Ltd. (SHELL) , a fuel
retailer, said profit declined 40 percent in the second quarter
through June as operating costs increased.  Net income retreated to 56.9 million rupees ($2 million)
compared with 94.9 million rupees a year earlier, it said in a
 statement  published on the website of the Port Louis-based Stock
Exchange of Mauritius today. Sales increased 38 percent to 3.04
billion rupees, it said.  “Operating profits registered a drop as a result of an
increase in operating costs both at distribution and
administrative levels,” the Port Louis-based company said.  For the six months through June, net income fell 3.6
percent to 162.1 million rupees, while sales rose 41 percent to
6.06 billion rupees, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
