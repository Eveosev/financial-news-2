Unitech Ltd. (UT) ,  India ’s second-largest
developer, said net income in the three months through June 30
fell 45 percent on lower home sales.  Profit in the quarter dropped to 983.6 million rupees
($21.7 million), lower than the 1.58 billion-rupee median of 15
estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales slid 28 percent to 5.96
billion rupees, according to a statement from the company.  India’s central bank, which has increased its benchmark
repurchase rate 11 times starting March 2010 by 3.25 percentage
points to 8 percent, may boost it further by half a percentage
point before the end of 2011, the median of 11 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey showed.  Sales in  New Delhi  and its surrounding areas declined 19
percent to 22 million square feet in the quarter from the
previous three months, while unsold units are at a record 220
million square feet, according to Liases Foras Real Estate
Rating & Research Pvt., a Mumbai-based research company.  Unitech sold 1.9 million square feet valued at 10.2 billion
rupees in the quarter ended June 30, according to the statement.
It cut debt by 2.04 billion rupees in the quarter.  The shares have plunged 56 percent this year as federal
investigators deepened their probe into the sale of mobile-phone
licenses in 2008. The New Delhi-based company’s Managing
Director Sanjay Chandra is among corporate executives jailed by
the nation’s  Supreme Court  after the  Central Bureau of
Investigation  charged a minister, bureaucrats and a lawmaker
with conspiracy to sell airwaves below cost. Chandra has denied
any wrongdoing.  Unitech Wireless Ltd. is the developer’s phone venture with
Telenor ASA. The telecommunications investigation pertains to
Unitech Wireless Tamilnadu Pvt., a separate legal entity engaged
in the telecommunications business, and will not impact the real
estate developer, Unitech has said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
