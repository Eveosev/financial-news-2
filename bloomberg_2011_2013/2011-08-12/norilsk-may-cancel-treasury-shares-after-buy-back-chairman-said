OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the world’s
largest producer of the metal, may cancel treasury shares after
a plan for a buyback announced this week, the chairman said.  “It is an international practice and we think that the
shares which Norilsk will buy back from the investors should be
canceled,” Andrey Bugrov said today in interview in Moscow.  Norilsk said this week that its board will discuss a
possible buyback, the third this year, on Aug. 15. The terms
haven’t been discussed yet, Bugrov said.  “The board will suggest on Monday that management should
work out the terms of the offer, considering the investment
plans of the company”, he said. The main goal of this buyback
is to support the shares when markets aren’t stable, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
