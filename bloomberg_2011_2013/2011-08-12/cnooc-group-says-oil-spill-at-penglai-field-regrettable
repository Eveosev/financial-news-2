China  National Offshore Oil Corp.,
the country’s largest offshore oil producer, said the spill at
Penglai 19-3 field in  Bohai Bay  is regrettable and that it’s
sorry for not preventing the accident.  The state-controlled  oil company  will assist and supervise
ConocoPhillips, the operator of the field, in cleaning up the
leak, Beijing-based China National Offshore said in a  statement 
on its website.  The Chinese government ordered ConocoPhillips and China
National Offshore, which jointly own the field, to halt
production at two platforms at Penglai 19-3 in northeastern
China last month, following two leaks in June. The spill, which
polluted an area of at least 840 square kilometers (324 square
miles), may exceed an initial estimate of 1,500 barrels of oil
and oil-based drilling fluids, the official Xinhua News Agency
said on Aug. 3, citing the Houston-based company.  China’s State Oceanic Administration this week told
 ConocoPhillips (COP)  to apologize to the public for not cleaning up
the spill more quickly and urged the U.S. oil producer to plug
the source of the leaks and eliminate the risk of further spills
by the end of this month. Two phone calls to the media
department of ConocoPhillips’s China unit seeking comment
weren’t answered.  ConocoPhillips has recovered 1,695 barrels of oil-based mud
and deployed about 900 personnel and more than 30 vessels during
the cleanup, the company’s China unit said in a statement on its
 website  yesterday.  The U.S. oil producer operates the Penglai 19-3, 19-9 and
25-6 fields, which together gave it 56,000 barrels of oil a day
in 2010, data on the company’s website show. China National
Offshore’s has a 51 percent stake in Penglai 19-3 through  Cnooc
Ltd. (883) , according to the Hong Kong-listed unit.  Halting production at the two platforms will cut
ConocoPhillips’ share of the output by about 17,000 barrels of
oil a day net after royalties, the company said. Cnooc’s daily
share of production from the platforms was 22,000 barrels,
according to the Chinese company.  --Winnie Zhu. Editors: Ryan Woo, Baldave Singh.  To contact the reporter on this story:
