Tiger Woods finished his second
round of the PGA Championship at 10 over par, six shots off the
projected cut line at the seasonâ€™s final major tournament.  With more than 30 players left on the course, the cut line
is expected to be 4 over. Only the top 70 players, plus ties,
move on to weekend play.  It would be the first time Woods, 35, has failed to make
the cut in 14 appearances at the PGA Championship, where he has
won the title four times. He has missed the cut in three other
Grand Slam events.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
