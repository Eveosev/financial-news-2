U.S. stocks fell for a third
straight week, including the biggest one-day drop since 2008, as
 Standard & Poor’s  reduction of the nation’s credit rating and
 Europe ’s debt crisis fueled concern the economy will falter.  The S&P 500 pared its slump in the last two days of the
week as government data showed jobless claims unexpectedly
decreased and retail sales improved.  Bank of America Corp. (BAC) 
plunged 12 percent, the worst performing stock in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average.  Walt Disney Co. (DIS)  sank 5.9 percent after
posting disappointing third-quarter studio revenue. For-profit
educator  DeVry Inc. (DV)  lost 23 percent, the largest drop in the S&P
500, after it said new undergraduate enrollment fell.  The S&P 500 lost 1.7 percent to 1,178.81 in the five days
ended Aug. 12, capping a week of record swings. The Dow fell
175.59 points, or 1.5 percent, to 11,269.02. Both gauges have
fallen for three straight weeks.  “Investors are going to have to get accustomed to above-
normal volatility,” Leo Grohowski, chief investment officer for
BNY Mellon Wealth Management in Boston, said in a telephone
interview. The firm oversees $171 billion. “Economic
uncertainty is going to continue to outweigh the good news from
company fundamentals. We’re all hostage to the news flow out.”  About $6.8 trillion was wiped off the value of global
equity markets from July 26 through Aug. 11 as Europe’s debt
crisis deepened and investors speculated the economy may
contract. The swings in U.S. equities this week were
unprecedented in the history of the American stock market,
according to data compiled by Birinyi Associates Inc., Bloomberg
and  Howard Silverblatt , senior index analyst at S&P.  Record Swings  The  S&P 500  plunged 6.7 percent on Aug. 8, its biggest
slump since December 2008, in the first trading session after
the U.S. was stripped of its AAA credit rating at S&P. The index
rebounded 4.7 percent the next day after the  Federal Reserve 
said it will leave its benchmark  interest rate  at a record low
through at least the middle of 2013. The gauge then fell 4.4
percent on Aug. 10 and rebounded 4.6 percent the next day.  Never before has the S&P 500 reversed moves that large in
each session over a four-day period, the data show. This week’s
trading also marked the first time the Dow moved more than 400
points either up or down for four days in a row.  “This week was unnerving,” said Channing Smith, a  money
manager  at Capital Advisors in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The firm manages
$920 million. “The large price swings are indicative of
uncertainty in the markets, but we haven’t panicked. Our clients
haven’t panicked. We used the market sell-off to go in and buy
high-quality stocks. The economy is very sluggish and growth is
below-trend but it’s still positive.”  Losses Pared  The S&P 500 rallied 5.2 percent in the final two days of
the week, its biggest back-to-back gain since March 2009, as
economic reports showed first-time applications for jobless
benefits decreased 7,000 in the week ended Aug. 6 and retail
sales increased the most in fourth months.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, which
is known as the VIX and measures the cost of using options as
insurance against declines in the S&P 500, climbed 14 percent to
36.36 this week. The index surged 50 percent on Aug. 8, its
biggest one-day gain since February 2007.  The rout in global markets spurred some Wall Street
strategists and investors to revise their outlooks on equities
and the economic recovery. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its 2011
target for the S&P 500 on Aug. 5, while  Laszlo Birinyi , one of
the first investors to recommend buying when the bull market
began in 2009, said his forecast for the benchmark equity index
was “shaky.”  ‘Uncertainty and Fear’  David Kostin , the New York-based equity strategist at
Goldman, lowered his estimate for the S&P 500 to 1,400 at year
end from 1,450. “Uncertainty and fear trump fundamentals and
valuations,” Kostin wrote in a note. He said a recession is not
“the most probable outcome in 2012.”  Birinyi, of Westport, Connecticut-based research firm
Birinyi Associates Inc., wrote in an Aug. 9 note, “The bull
market is intact, and while our ‘target’ of 1,450 in mid-2012 is
admittedly a bit shaky, our more important conclusion that a
rational, disciplined portfolio can attain a 10 percent plus
return in 2011 is not.”  Birinyi also said financial companies are unlikely to
outperform as the rally continues. Bank shares declined the most
out of 24 groups in the S&P 500 this week, losing 1.6 percent,
amid concern the European sovereign-debt crisis will threaten
profits.  Banks Slump  Bank of America sank 12 percent to $7.19. American
International Group Inc. disclosed plans this week to sue the
Charlotte, North Carolina-based bank over allegedly faulty
mortgages. The firm’s plunge in share prices over the past week
stoked concern it may need to raise capital. Chief Executive
Officer  Brian T. Moynihan  said on a conference call hosted by
mutual fund manager  Bruce Berkowitz  that the biggest U.S. lender
is being buoyed by conditions that are better than they’ve been
since the credit crisis.  Citigroup Inc. (C)  retreated 11 percent to $29.85.  JPMorgan
Chase & Co. (JPM)  slumped 4.5 percent to $35.91.  American Express Co. (AXP) 
lost 4.9 percent to $44.89.  Comerica Inc. (CMA)  decreased 16 percent
to $24.41, the second-biggest decline in the S&P 500 this week.  Disney, the world’s largest theme-park company, slid 5.9
percent to $33.09 amid concern that slowing consumer spending
and rising costs at the ESPN sports network may crimp profit
growth. The Burbank, California-based company posted third-
quarter studio revenue of $1.62 billion, compared with the
average analyst estimate of $1.83 billion.  DeVry, AOL  DeVry Inc. fell 23 percent to $44.49. New summer enrollment
dropped 26 percent to 15,566 from 20,935 a year earlier, the
Downers Grove, Illinois-based company said.  AOL Inc. (AOL)  tumbled 27 percent, the most since it was spun off
from Time Warner Inc. in November 2009, to $11.78. The Internet
company reported on Aug. 9 a second-quarter loss and an 8.4
percent drop in sales. The New York-based company trimmed its
weekly loss two days later, rising 12 percent, after announcing
it authorized a $250 million stock buyback.  Speculation the economic slowdown will worsen has
overshadowed better-than-estimated profit by companies. Per-
share earnings increased 17 percent among the S&P 500 companies
that have released quarterly results since July 11, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. About three-quarters of the
companies have topped the average analyst profit forecast, the
data show.  Cisco Systems Inc. (CSCO)  rallied 7 percent to $15.99, the biggest
jump in the Dow. The world’s biggest maker of networking
equipment reported profit was 40 cents a share in the fiscal
fourth quarter, beating the 38-cent average estimate by
analysts, according to Bloomberg data.  “This is an exceptional buying opportunity for U.S.
equities,” Barry Knapp, the New York-based head of U.S. equity
strategy at Barclays Plc, said on a conference call this week.
“The incoming data is going to be better, which is going to
serve to stabilize the macroeconomic outlook and set the stage
for a reversal in equity markets.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
