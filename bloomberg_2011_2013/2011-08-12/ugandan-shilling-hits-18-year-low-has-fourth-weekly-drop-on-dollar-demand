Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s
worst-performing currency in the last two months, headed for a
fourth week of declines against the dollar after reaching an 18-
year low on rising demand for the U.S. currency.  The currency of East  Africa ’s third-biggest economy
depreciated as much as 1.4 percent to 2,817.5 per dollar, the
weakest since June 1993, and traded 0.5 percent down at 2,795 by
3:48 p.m. in the capital, Kampala, extending its drop this week
to 4.5 percent, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “There is general demand for the dollar in the market by
importers and multinational companies and yet there is a
significant reduction of dollar inflows,” Denis Mashanyu, a
currency trader at Standard Chartered Bank of Uganda Ltd., said
by phone from Nairobi, the capital of neighboring  Kenya .  The shilling has declined because of “negative sentiments
in the market” and the failure by the central bank to
frequently sell the dollar, he said.  The currency of Africa’s second-biggest coffee producer has
fallen 17 percent against the dollar this year, making it the
world’s worst-performing currency. A surge in food and fuel
prices pushed inflation to a more than 18-year high of 18.7
percent in July from 15.7 percent in June.  Uganda is on the cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc,
the U.K.-based energy company, expected to start pumping crude
and gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an
estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion
barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
