The European Commission may propose
cutting subsidies to the biggest recipients of the 58.2 billion
euros ($82 billion) spent on agricultural subsidies every year,
according to an official with direct knowledge of the talks.  The cuts will apply to anyone getting more than 150,000
euros a year and be capped at a maximum of 300,000 euros, said
the official, who declined to be identified because the
proposals are still being drafted. Exceptions to the maximum
would be made for environmental measures or businesses employing
large numbers of people, the official said.  The European Commission, the executive arm of the 27-nation
European Union, is reviewing its agricultural policy for changes
that will be made after 2013. Agriculture Commissioner Dacian
Ciolos said in January the policy should focus on income support
and limit payouts to the biggest aid recipients.  Roger Waite , a
spokesman for the commission, declined to comment because the
proposals won’t be announced until Oct. 12.  “There’s a very strong feeling among European taxpayers
that certain really large farms get too much,” Waite said.  The commission’s draft proposal was reported earlier today
by the Financial Times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
