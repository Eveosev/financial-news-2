Poland’s zloty gained for a second
day against the euro, paring its biggest weekly retreat in 15
months, as a ban on stock short-sales in some European markets
helped restore investor demand for riskier assets worldwide.  The zloty added 0.5 percent to 4.1453 per euro by 3:25 p.m.
in Warsaw. It was still 2.7 percent weaker compared with the
close on Aug. 5, headed for the worst weekly drop since May
2010. Against the Swiss franc, the Polish currency gained for a
second day, rising 2.5 percent to 3.7689 and reducing its five-
day retreat to 2.2 percent.  European shares advanced, extending the Stoxx Europe 600
Index’s rebound from a two-year low after  France ,  Spain ,  Italy 
and Belgium banned short-selling, or bearish bets placed with
borrowed stock, in an effort to stabilize markets reeling from
the government-debt crisis.  To contact the reporter on this story:
