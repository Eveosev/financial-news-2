Turkey ’s benchmark  ISE National 100
Index (XU100)  climbed 171.63, or 0.3 percent, to 52,188.65 at the 5:30
p.m. close in Istanbul, paring its five-day decline to 7.3
percent, a second weekly drop.  The following stocks were active. Symbols are in
parentheses.  Kiler Gayrimenkul Yatirim Ortakligi AS (KLGYO TI), a real
estate developer, jumped the most since its April public
offering, gaining 27 kurus, or 10 percent, to 2.94 liras after
reporting second-quarter profit of 19.9 million liras ($11
million) compared with a 9.65 million-lira loss the previous
year.  Turkcell Iletisim Hizmetleri AS (TCELL TI), Turkey’s
largest mobile-phone company, lost 38 kurus, or 4.7 percent, to
7.66 liras, its lowest close since April 2009. Sweden’s
 TeliaSonera AB (TLSN) , the company’s largest shareholder, said its
rights were violated at a special board meeting yesterday, and
the sides failed to approve a proposed dividend of 75 percent of
net income for last year or to approve financial statements from
2010.  Turk Traktor & Ziraat Makineleri AS (TTRAK TI), a maker of
tractors and farm equipment, surged 3.5 liras, or 12 percent, to
33 liras. The shares lost 33 percent in the eight days through
Aug. 10, when the stock’s 14-day relative strength index reached
16.9. A reading of below 30 is a signal to some investors that
shares are set to increase.  The global “chaotic environment” spurred the drop,
analyst Kenan Turan at Istanbul’s Tera Brokers said in e-mailed
comments. “The stock performance has been spectacular since the
beginning of the year with 66 percent outperformance to the ISE
100” and “still presents a respectable return potential with
34 percent upside.”  Uyum Gida Ihtiyac Maddeleri Sanayi & Ticaret AS (UYUM TI),
a wholesale food and basic consumer goods company, jumped 52
kurus, or 7.4 percent, to 7.52 liras after saying it signed a
12-month confidentiality accord with a foreign fund and will
sell a stake in the company, according to Bloomberg HT
television.  To contact the reporter on this story:
