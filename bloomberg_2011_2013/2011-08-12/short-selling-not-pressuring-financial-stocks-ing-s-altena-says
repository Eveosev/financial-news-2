Financial stocks aren’t under
“severe pressure” because of short-selling, said  Maarten Altena , an equity analyst at ING Bank NV.  Pressure on the shares is coming from “real money
outflows, reflecting fears over the inability of politicians and
central bankers to handle the (growing) EU debt crisis,” Altena
wrote today in a note to investors.  France, Italy, Spain and Belgium imposed bans on short-
selling starting today after European bank stocks sank to their
lowest in almost 2 1/2 years.  “Reactions on the short-selling ban are mixed, as short
selling can also be used to unmask fundamental errors,” Altena
wrote. “Furthermore, one can argue whether the short-selling
bans have the desired effects.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
