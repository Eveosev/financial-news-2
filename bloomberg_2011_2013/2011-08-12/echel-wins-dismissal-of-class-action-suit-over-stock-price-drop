OAO Mechel,  Russia ’s largest
producer of coking coal, won its bid to have a U.S. judge
dismiss a class action suit filed in 2009 by investor Dean
Frederick and four pension funds over share-price declines.  Judge  Richard Sullivan  in the District Court of the
Southern District of New York ruled in Mechel’s favor on Aug. 9,
court documents show.  Mechel, controlled by billionaire Igor Zyuzin, was sued by
investors over the drop in its share price after Russian
authorities said in 2008 the company was engaged in anti-
competitive conduct.  Mechel’s American Depositary Receipts lost half their value
in New York trading in the week after Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said July 24 the company avoided taxes and sold coal to a
Swiss unit at a quarter of the price charged domestically.  Mechel “failed to disclose material adverse facts about
the company’s financial well-being, business relationships and
prospects,” Frederick said in his complaint.  Ekaterina Videman, a spokeswoman for Mechel, declined to
comment on the court decision.  The case is Frederick v. Mechel OAO, 09-cv-3617, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of  New York  ( Manhattan ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
