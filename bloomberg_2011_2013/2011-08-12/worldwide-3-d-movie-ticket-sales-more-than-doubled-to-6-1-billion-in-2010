Ticket sales for 3-D movies more
than doubled to $6.1 billion worldwide last year, driven by
demand outside  North America , IHS Inc. said.  Markets other than North America generated $3.9 billion, or
64 percent, of the revenue, an increase from 54 percent the
previous year, the Englewood, Colorado-based research company
said today in a statement. The global total rose from $2.5
billion in 2009, IHS said.  International sales have become increasingly important for
three-dimensional movies. Sales in the U.S., the biggest market
for the films, were 33 percent of the total last year, a
decrease from 42 percent in 2009, according to IHS.  Movies released this year, including  Walt Disney Co. (DIS) ’s
“Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides” and  DreamWorks
Animation SKG Inc. (DWA) ’s “Kung Fu Panda 2,” took in less than 50
percent of U.S. revenue from 3-D screenings. In 2009 and early
2010, the rate for major releases was in the upper 60 percent
range or higher.  Disney’s “Alice in Wonderland,” released in March 2010,
earned 70 percent of its U.S. box-office revenue from 3-D, and
DreamWorks Animation’s “How to Train Your Dragon,” which made
its debut the same month, took in 68 percent, according to BTIG
Research analyst  Rich Greenfield .  To contact the reporters on this story:
