There is an 80 percent chance that
Jefferson County,  Alabama , officials will vote to file for
Chapter 9 bankruptcy today, Commissioner Sandra Little Brown
said before the panel was set to meet to consider the option.  A Chapter 9 filing by the county of 660,000 would be the
largest in U.S. municipal history. Jefferson owes $3.14 billion
on sewer bonds left from a failed refinancing that left it
exposed to the 2008 financial crisis.  Last night, Little Brown, one of five county commissioners,
had put the probability at “50-50.” She said her concern grew
because of parts of the creditors’ settlement proposal that
would require that the county end all lawsuits against banks and
possibly criminal prosecutions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
