German stocks climbed for a second
day, as the benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  extended its rebound from the
lowest level since February 2010, amid speculation the slump
isn’t commensurate with the outlook for earnings.  The DAX gained 200.08, or 3.5 percent, to 5,997.74 at the
5:30 p.m. close in Frankfurt, trimming this week’s drop to 3.8
percent. The gauge had tumbled 20 percent from this year’s high
on May 2 amid concern that the global economic recovery is
stalling, while European leaders struggled to contain the
sovereign-debt crisis. The broader HDAX Index climbed 3.4
percent today.  The decline dragged the price-to-earnings ratio on the DAX
to 9 times its constituents’ estimated profits, close to the
ratio of 8.2 reached in October 2008, five months before the
 bull market  in equities began, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  “Valuations are cheap as long as the earnings estimates
are somewhere near right,” said  Andy Lynch , who manages about
$1.9 billion at Schroder Investment Management Ltd. in  London ,
in a Bloomberg Television interview. “There are some individual
opportunities out there, but at the aggregate level, there are
still some headwinds.”  Earnings for companies in the DAX will grow 27 percent over
the next 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Deutsche Bank AG (DBK) , Germany’s largest bank, advanced 4
percent to 30.29 euros, while competitor  Commerzbank AG (CBK)  jumped
5.4 percent to 2.21 euros.  Adidas AG (ADS) , the maker of sporting
goods, gained 2.2 percent to 49.42 euros, while Metro AG,
Germany’s biggest retailer, rose 5 percent to 32.78 euros.  IVG Immobilien AG (IVG)  sank 4.5 percent to 3.53 euros after
posting an unexpected loss. The company reported a second-
quarter net loss of 68.8 million euros ($98 million). The German
real-estate company also forecast a loss for the full year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
