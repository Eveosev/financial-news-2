Poland’s benchmark stock index
headed for its biggest two-day gain since 2009 as a stronger
zloty against the Swiss franc eased concern borrowers will
default on foreign-currency home loans and copper producer  KGHM
Polska Miedz SA (KGH)  reported a record profit.  The WIG20 Index jumped 2 percent to 2,339.21 at 12:05 p.m.
in Warsaw, extending yesterday’s 4.5 percent advance. The gauge
is still down 21 percent from a 2011 high on April 8, amid
speculation that  Europe ’s debt crisis is spreading and the U.S.
economic recovery is stalling.  “Polish banks were heavily oversold and the positive news
from the  currency market  is helping them rebound,” said Tomasz
Bursa, a Warsaw-based analyst at Ipopema Securities SA.  Warsaw’s WIG Banking Index slumped to the lowest level
since October 2009 on Aug. 10 as the zloty tumbled to a record
low against the Swiss franc, raising concern the quality of
Polish banks’ loans will worsen. Franc-denominated mortgages
totaled 151.8 billion zloty ($52 billion) in June, accounting
for almost 53 percent of all home loans in  Poland , according to
the country’s financial regulator.  The franc weakened for a second day as rallying equity
markets lessened demand for the safest assets, a day after the
nation’s central bank indicated it may consider pegging the
currency to the euro. The zloty climbed 2.4 percent against the
franc today, extending yesterday’s 4.3 percent advance.  Getin Holding  Getin Holding SA (GTN) , the financial-services group controlled
by Polish billionaire Leszek Czarnecki, soared 7 percent to 9.15
zloty, after advancing 7.1 percent yesterday. Getin is among
eastern European lenders whose earnings are most vulnerable to a
decline in the zloty against the Swiss currency, ING Groep NV
said on Aug. 9.  BRE Bank SA (BRE) , controlled by Commerzbank AG, jumped 4 percent
to 276.5 zloty and  Bank Millennium SA (MIL) , a unit of Banco Comercial
Portugues SA, increased 2.4 percent to 4.3 zloty.  PKO Bank Polski SA added 1.5 percent to 35.54 zloty after
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. reiterated its “buy” recommendation
for Poland’s largest bank, with a price estimate at 56.9 zloty.  KGHM Polska Miedz SA, the copper producer with the biggest
European mine output, increased 1 percent to 163.5 zloty, its
second day of gains. Unconsolidated net income, which excludes
earnings at certain units such as phone company Telefonia Dialog
SA, rose to 2.36 billion zloty ($805 million) from 1.5 billion
zloty a year earlier, beating the 2.14 billion-zloty mean
estimate of 12 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
