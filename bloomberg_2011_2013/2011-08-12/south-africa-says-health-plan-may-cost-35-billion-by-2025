South Africa ’s government said a
compulsory medical insurance plan that will be implemented over
the next 14 years may cost as much as 255.8 billion rand ($35
billion) annually by 2025.  The government aims to introduce the plan from April,
starting with a pilot program in 10 of the 53 health districts,
Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi said yesterday. The required
funding could rise from 125.3 billion rand next year to 213.6
billion rand in 2020 and 255.8 billion rand in 2025, the Health
Ministry said in a draft policy released for public comment
today.  Those estimates are “indicative” of what it will cost to
provide universal access to cost-effective  health services ,
Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  told reporters in  Pretoria 
yesterday. “That doesn’t mean that’s going to be the cost. We
will have to do a lot more work in order to get a fiscally
affordable system going.”  Privately insured  South Africans  on average have access to
medical benefits worth six times more than those who rely on the
state, which services 84 percent of the population of 50.6
million, according to the Health Ministry.  “There is recognition that this system is neither rational
nor fair,” the ministry said in its draft policy. “National
health insurance is intended to ensure that all South African
citizens and legal residents will benefit from health-care
financing on an equitable and sustainable basis.”  The national budget released in February allocated 112.6
billion rand toward healthcare in the year through March 2012
and 120.6 billion rand the following year. Spending on private
health insurance amounted to about 92 billion rand last year,
according to government estimates.  Implementing the new health plan “could imply an
additional tax for individuals and the need for increased
funding from local capital markets,” Standard Bank Group Ltd.,
 Africa ’s largest lender, said in e-mailed comments today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
