Peruvian benchmark bonds gained,
sending yields to a five-month low, as the faltering global
recovery led traders to bet the nation’s central bank may wait
until next year to raise  interest rates .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell four basis points, or 0.04
percentage point, to 6.03 percent at 11:44 a.m. New York time,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose
0.27 centimo to 112.41 centimos per sol, the highest since Feb.
23. The price has risen 0.74 centimo this week, the most since
the period ending May 6.  The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 4.25 percent
for a third straight month at a policy meeting yesterday, citing
“weakness” in the global economy and signs of slower domestic
growth.  Standard & Poor’s  unprecedented downgrade of the U.S.’s
top credit rating is fueling “uncertainty” about the world
economy, the central bank said.  “Although  Peru  showed itself to be prepared during the
2008 crisis, this time it’s a bit more complicated,” said
Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco Internacional del
Peru. “If global conditions stay like this and August inflation
isn’t very high or comes in below market expectations, the rate
could remain at 4.25 until the end of the year. I don’t see the
central bank being very aggressive.”  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7410 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7445 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
