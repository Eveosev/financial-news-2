The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index

in Johannesburg, bringing the week’s gains to 2 percent.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  Anglo American Plc (AAL)  , the mining company that makes
up 9 percent of the benchmark  stock index , rose for a second
day, adding 4.10 rand, or 1.5 percent, to 283.10 rand. Copper

in U.S. retail sales provided additional evidence of sustained
economic growth, tempering concern that the recovery is
faltering.  BHP Billiton Ltd. (BHP)  , the world’s biggest mining
group, closed at its highest in over a week, rising 6.64 rand,
or 2.9 percent, to 235.64 rand.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, fell for the first day in four, dropping 5.50 rand, or

rise in U.S. retail sales eroded demand for the metal as a
haven.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, declined the most in over two weeks, falling 3.01
rand, or 2.6 percent, to 114.99 rand.  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest

Stassen told Bloomberg the lender can maintain its rate of
adding at least 50 branches a year for the next five years.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the world’s second-
largest producer of the metal, closed at its highest since Aug.
2, advancing 1.94 rand, or 1.2 percent, to 169.07 rand. The

expected to be between 37 percent and 42 percent higher than a
year earlier.  Kumba Iron Ore Ltd. (KIO)  , an iron ore-producing unit of
 Anglo American Plc (AGL) , fell for the first day in three, declining
9.20 rand, or 1.8 percent, to 489.80 rand. Workers at the

tomorrow to protest over safety issues, the National Union of
Mineworkers said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nedbank Group Ltd. (NED)  , South Africa’s fourth-largest
commercial bank, closed at its highest in more than a week,
