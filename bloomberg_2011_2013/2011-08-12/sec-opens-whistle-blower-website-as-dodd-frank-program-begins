The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission, trying to encourage employees to report corporate
wrong-doing, opened a  website  today to gather tips as its new
bounty program for whistle-blowers officially begins.  The Dodd-Frank Act’s new incentive program, which rewards
tipsters with as much as 30 percent of penalties collected, has
been operating on an interim basis since the law was enacted
last year.  Sean McKessy, chief of the SEC’s whistle-blower office,
said in an interview that tip quality -- if not volume -- has
already improved since last year’s enactment. Some recent tips
will be eligible for the bounties, he said.  The SEC’s Office of Market Intelligence will do most of the
“wheat versus chaff work” to filter incoming tips, McKessy
said, noting that the SEC whistle-blower office has just seven
staffers. “We just don’t have the resources to read every
single one of them.”  Today’s formal opening means whistle-blowers will now have
to submit tips in the agency’s approved formats, such as a
questionnaire accessed through the website.  Companies have told the SEC they’re concerned that the
program will cause whistle-blowers to ignore firms’ internal
compliance programs.  McKessy said employees who first report a securities law
violation to their companies will get the same reward
consideration as if they reported it to the SEC. They also
“receive the benefit of all the information uncovered by the
company in connection with its own internal investigation of the
alleged wrongdoing,” he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
