South Korea ’s won rose, paring a
weekly loss, as an unexpected drop in U.S. jobless claims eased
concern that the world’s biggest economy is headed for a
recession.  Government bonds  advanced.  Unemployment-benefit claims fell by 7,000 in the week ended
Aug. 6 to 395,000, the fewest since early April, the Labor
Department said yesterday. The median estimate of economists
surveyed by Bloomberg was for an increase to 405,000. The MSCI
Asia Pacific Index of regional shares fell for a second day
while South Korea’s Kospi Index swung between gains and losses
before declining 1.3 percent.  “Better than expected jobless claims in the U.S. had a
positive effect on market sentiment,” said Han Sung Min, a
foreign-exchange dealer at Busan Bank in  Seoul . “Still, gains
in the won were limited as the Kospi Index weakened in afternoon
trading,”  The won appreciated 0.2 percent to 1,079.63 per dollar at
the 3 p.m. close in Seoul, after strengthening to 1,072.94,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency lost 1.1
percent this week.  Inflation is likely to remain a problem after heavy rain
disrupted  food production  in South Korea, and as low U.S.
interest rates increase liquidity in global markets, Finance
Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today. Bahk reiterated he’ll keep
policy efforts aimed at stabilizing prices.  The Bank of Korea left its benchmark  interest rate 
unchanged at 3.25 percent for a second month yesterday, after
having raised it three times this year.  The yield on the 3.5 percent notes due June 2014 fell three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 3.48 percent, Korea
Exchange Inc. prices show.  South Korea’s 20-year government bond yields declined to
3.93 percent, the lowest level since these long-term maturity
securities were issued in January 2006, according to prices from
the Korea Financial Investment Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
