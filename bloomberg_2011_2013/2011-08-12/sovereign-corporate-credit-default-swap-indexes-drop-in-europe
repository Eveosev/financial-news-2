The cost of insuring against default
on European sovereign and corporate debt fell, according to
traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx SovX Western Europe Index of credit-
default swaps on 15 governments dropped 9 basis points to 280,
signaling an improvement in perceptions of  credit quality . Swaps
on  France  fell 21.5 basis points to 147.5 and contracts on Italy
dropped 22 basis points to 349, CMA prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Crossover Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 40 companies with mostly high-yield ratings dropped
29.5 basis points to 625.5, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co. at
3 p.m. in London.  The Markit iTraxx Europe Index of credit-default swaps
linked to 125 companies with investment-grade ratings declined
6.5 basis points to 149. The Markit iTraxx Financial Index
linked to the senior debt of 25 banks and insurers fell 8 basis
points to 235, while contracts on subordinated securities were
15 basis points lower at 400.  The price of swaps insuring Societe Generale SAâ€™s senior
debt fell 38 basis points to 290, down from an earlier record
346 basis points, according to CMA.  A basis point on a credit-default swap protecting 10
million euros ($14.2 million) of debt from default for five
years is equivalent to 1,000 euros a year. Swaps pay the buyer
face value in exchange for the underlying securities or the cash
equivalent should a borrower fail to adhere to its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
