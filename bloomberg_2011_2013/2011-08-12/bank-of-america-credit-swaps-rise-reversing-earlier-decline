The cost of protecting against a
default by Bank of America Corp. rose, reversing an earlier
decline as credit swaps on U.S. lenders head for their biggest
weekly increase since March 2009.  Contracts on  Charlotte , North Carolina-based Bank of
America gained 30 basis points to 340 basis points as of 4:29
p.m. in New York, after earlier dropping to 285, according to
broker Phoenix Partners Group. The contracts, which typically
increase as investor confidence deteriorates, have climbed from
208 on Aug. 5 and reached as high as a mid-price of 370
yesterday.  The average credit-default swap on the six biggest U.S.
banks rose 45.7 basis points this week to 205.1, CMA data show.  Credit-default swaps pay the buyer face value if a borrower
fails to meets its obligations, less the value of the defaulted
debt. A basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract
protecting $10 million of debt.  Contracts on Morgan Stanley fell 11 basis points to 263,
while swaps on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. were unchanged at 201
basis points, erasing an earlier decline, according to data
provider CMA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
