The rand advanced versus the dollar
for a third day, paring its worst weekly decline since May,
after U.S. retail sales data eased concern the world’s biggest
economy is headed for a recession.  The rand strengthened as much as 1 percent to 7.1580 per
dollar, and traded 0.7 percent stronger at 7.1835 as of 3:16
p.m. in Johannesburg, paring its decline this week to 3.7
percent, the most since the week ending May 13. The rand gained
0.4 percent to 10.2395 per euro.  Emerging-market stocks rose and commodity prices gained for
a third day after data showed U.S. retail sales climbed by the
most in four months in July. The report came after an unexpected
drop in jobless claims reported yesterday. The Dollar Index
declined for the first day in three as investors turned to
riskier, emerging-market assets.  South Africa ’s benchmark stock
index headed for its best week in six.  Recent economic data “is not a sign of an imminent
recession in the U.S.,” Tradition Analytics strategists led by
Johannesburg-based Quinten Bertenshaw wrote in a research note.
Signs of growth in the U.S. economy “impact capital flows and
the rand tremendously. Underlying rand strength will remain,”
they wrote.  The increase in retail sales, which was in line with the
media estimate of economists in a Bloomberg survey, could spark
a “near-term” advance for the rand to 6.96, Standard Bank
Group Ltd. analysts led by Johannesburg-based Michael Keenan
wrote in a research note. The move could prove temporary, the
analysts said.  Rand ‘Vulnerable’  “The rand remains vulnerable to the global growth outlook
and sovereign debt fears” which saw the currency plunging to a
two-year low versus the dollar on Aug. 9, the Standard Bank
analysts said. The South African currency could weaken to 7.38
per dollar today and 7.50 in coming weeks, Standard said.  The likelihood of the rand trading at 7.50 per dollar in
the next month was 50 percent, implied volatility from options
contracts monitored by Bloomberg showed when the rand traded at
7.18 per dollar.  The 13.5 percent notes due 2015 added 6 cents to 122.77
rand, driving the yield down two basis points, or 0.02
percentage point, to 6.97 percent. The 6.75 percent securities
due 2021 declined 25 cents to 91.25 rand, boosting the yield
four basis points to 8.07 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
