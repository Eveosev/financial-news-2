PT Aneka Tambang’s ferronickel
production gained six percent in the first half from a year
earlier, said Alwin Syah Loebis, president director at the
Indonesian state-owned mining company. Gold output fell.  Ferronickel production rose to 9,838 metric tons in the six
months through June, compared with 9,252 tons a year earlier,
Loebis told reporters in Jakarta late yesterday.  That accounts for 55 percent of this year’s output target,
the company said in a statement. Sales fell 7 percent to 9,072
tons, it said. Gold production declined 10 percent to 1.2 tons,
or 41 percent of target, while sales rose 6 percent to 3.6 tons,
the statement said.  Aneka reported a 32 percent increase in first-half net
income to 997 billion rupiah ($116.7 million), the statement
said, confirming comments by the State-Owned Enterprises
Ministry Aug. 10. Revenue rose 13 percent to 4.9 trillion rupiah.  The company has spent 1.5 trillion rupiah in  capital
expenditures  in the first half, out of 3.9 trillion rupiah
slated for the whole 2011, Loebis said.  Aneka Tambang gained 2.6 percent to 1,960 rupiah a share at
2:50 p.m. Jakarta time. The stock has fallen 20 percent this
year, compared with the 4.5 percent gain on the benchmark
 Jakarta Composite Index. (JCI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
