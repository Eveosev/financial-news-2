Jason Dufner , Keegan Bradley, John
Senden and Scott Verplank are tied for the lead at 5-under par
during the second round of golf’s U.S. PGA Championship.  Dufner and Bradley have finished their second rounds at
Atlanta Athletic Club in Johns Creek, Georgia, while Senden and
Verplank are still on the course.  Jim Furyk, D.A. Points,  Steve Stricker  and Brandt Jobe are
4-under par at the season’s final major championship.  Tiger Woods finished 10-over par, six shots off the
projected cut line for weekend play. It would be the third time
Woods has missed the 36-hole cut at a major as a professional.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
