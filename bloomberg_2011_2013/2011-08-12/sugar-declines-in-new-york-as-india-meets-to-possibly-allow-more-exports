Raw sugar fell for the first time in
four days as signs of rising exports from  Thailand  and  India 
eased concern that output will decline in Brazil, the world’s
largest grower. Cocoa rose, and coffee was little changed.  Thailand, the second-biggest exporter, may boost shipments
by as much as 5 percent to 7.5 million metric tons next year as
planting increases, Prasert Tapaneeyangkul, the secretary-
general of the Office of the Cane & Sugar Board, said today in
an interview in Bangkok. India, the second-largest producer,
today approved additional exports for 500,000 tons, a minister
told reporters.  “There was selling pressure from India, Thailand and, to a
lesser extent, the  Philippines  in today’s trade, which offset
the tight supply-demand balance the world is currently in,”
Rafael Crestana, a risk-management consultant with FCStone Group
Inc., said in a telephone interview from Campinas,  Brazil .  Sugar for October delivery fell 0.24 cent, or 0.9 percent,
to settle at 27.84 cents a pound as of 2 p.m. on ICE Futures
U.S. in  New York . In London, refined-sugar futures for October
delivery fell $6.20, or 0.8 percent, to $743.50 a ton on NYSE
Liffe.  Prices in New York gained 1.1 percent for the week,
extending the rally in the past year to 47 percent, on concern
that output is dropping in Brazil’s main growing area, the
Center-South. Cane production in the region will total 510.2
million tons this year, down 4.4 percent from a July estimate of
533.5 million, Unica, a Sao Paulo-based trade group, said Aug.
11.  Bullish Brazil Data  “Even though the numbers were not worse than first
estimated, and mirrors cane-output of three years ago, Brazil
now has more demand for sugar and ethanol,” Crestana said.  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery fell 0.2 cent,
or 0.1 percent, to settle at $2.4385 a pound on ICE. In  London ,
robusta-coffee futures for November delivery rose 2.7 percent to
$2,280 a ton.  Cocoa futures for December delivery advanced $21, or 0.7
percent, at $2,907 a ton on ICE.  Global output will exceed demand by 362,250 tons in the
year ending Sept. 30, analysts in a Bloomberg survey said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
