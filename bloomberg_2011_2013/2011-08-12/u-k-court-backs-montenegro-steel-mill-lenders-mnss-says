The main creditors of  Zeljezara AD
Niksic (ZEHK) , a Montenegrin steel mill, have secured a U.K. court
judgment backing their rights and claims against the steelworks
which was declared bankrupt three months ago, they said in an e-
mail today.  MNSS BV, a Dutch-based  investment company  which controlled
just above 50.1 percent of Zeljezara’s capital, and its sister
company Recupero Credito Acciao NV, reported Montenegro and its
steel mill to the European Union for violating investor rights.  They together hold 60 million euros ($85.59 million) worth
of claims and had turned to the U.K.  High Court  of Justice to
seek protection of their rights after a Montenegrin court and
Zeljezara’s bankruptcy administrator dismissed their claims.  The U.K. court yesterday issued a “judgment in favor of
MNSS and Recupero on all counts and including a declaration that
the amounts representing MNSS and Recupero’s claims as creditors
are ’due and owing’ by ZN to MNSS and Recupero respectively,”
MNSS said in the statement today.  The judgment is in the process of being served and enforced
in  Montenegro , MNSS representative Marc Jacobson, said as cited
in the statement.  Zeljezara was put into bankruptcy on April 15 by a workers
union that demanded overdue monthly wages. It is estimated to
have total liabilities of about 120 million euros ($175
million), while the book value of Zeljezara’s assets is about
100 million euros, according to June 7 report of  Ethemba Capital
LLP , which is representing MNSS.  To contact the reporter on this story:
