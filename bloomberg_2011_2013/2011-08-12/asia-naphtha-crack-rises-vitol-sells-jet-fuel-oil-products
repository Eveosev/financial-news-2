Asia ’s naphtha crack spread widened
this week, signaling increased profit for refiners. Vitol Group
sold jet-fuel cargoes in  Singapore , the region’s biggest oil-
trading center.  Light Distillates  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures rose
to $105.83 a metric ton at 5:45 p.m. Singapore time, from $88.92
at the end of trading in Asia last week, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. This crack spread is a measure of
refining profit.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the biggest naphtha buyer on the
Platts window this month, purchased 25,000 tons for delivery in
the second half of October from Glencore International AG at
$921 a ton, based on a Bloomberg News survey of traders
monitoring transactions on the window.  Middle Distillates  Vitol sold 100,000 barrels of  jet fuel  to Hin Leong Trading
Pte at 45 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes, according to
the Bloomberg News survey. That’s the first reported jet-fuel
transaction in Singapore since July 25. The Geneva-based trader
also sold to Cargill Inc. at a 40-cent discount.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil, or diesel, rose 40 cents to
$2.35 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM Oil
Associates Ltd., a broker. This regrade increased 52 percent
this week, the most in 12 weeks, indicating it is more
profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Hin Leong bought 250,000 barrels of 0.5 percent sulfur
gasoil from Shell at 60 cents a barrel below benchmark quotes,
the survey showed. That’s the largest discount since June 28.
The Singapore trader also sold a similar cargo to ConocoPhillips
at 40 cents below August quotes.  Gasoil’s premium to Asian benchmark Dubai crude fell $2.29
to $18.41 a barrel, PVM said. This crack spread shrank 4.2
percent this week, the most in seven weeks.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude widened 78 cents to
$5.65 a barrel at 2:21 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
The difference has increased 17 percent this week, signaling
growing losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
was unchanged after climbing to $8.25 a ton, PVM said. This
viscosity spread narrowed for a fourth week, meaning bunker, or
marine fuel, has gained more than higher-quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporters on this story:
