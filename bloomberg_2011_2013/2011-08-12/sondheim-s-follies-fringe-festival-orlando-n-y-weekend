Ageless Bernadette Peters burns
through  Stephen Sondheim ’s torchy “Losing My Mind.” That’s
just one highlight of “Follies,” Sondheim and James Goldman’s
killer musical about the end of burlesque and youthful optimism.  After an acclaimed revival at the Kennedy Center, the show
-- about two couples revisiting their days as stage-door
johnnies to a pair of follies girls -- has moved into the
Marquis Theatre.  Sondheim’s spectacular pastiche score includes the upbeat
“Broadway Baby,” the acid “Could I Leave You?” and the mock
song-and-dance number, “Buddy’s Blues.”  Jan Maxwell adds a cartwheel to the daredevil course that
is “The Story of Lucy and Jessie.” Elaine Page, the original
Evita and Grizabella, belts the incomparable “I’m Still Here.”  At Broadway and West 46th Street. Information: +1-877-250-
2929;  http://www.folliesbroadway.com .  Afterward, wax nostalgic over wine and cheese or something
more ambitious at Elsewhere, 403 W. 43rd St.; +1-212-315-2121.  Saturday  Catch a matinee of the lushly romantic “Death Takes a
Holiday” by Maury Yeston, the composer-lyricist of “Grand
Hotel” and “Nine.” Based on the play that became a hit film
for Fredric March, Yeston’s romantic score, with a book by
Thomas Meehan, abounds with lovely songs put across by a
sensational ensemble at the intimate  Laura Pels Theatre .  111 W. 46th St. Information: +1-212-719-1300;

chomping iceberg lettuce with Gorgonzola crumbles and great
burgers at Joe Allen, 326 W. 46th St.; +1-212-581-6464.  Pick a show, any show, at  The New York International Fringe
Festival . Now in its 15th year, the new edition offers some 200
events, each ticket $15 in advance or $18 at the door. You never
know what your $15 will buy -- maybe the next “Urinetown” (and
maybe not).  Today’s options include in alphabetical order: The comedic
“ The Apartment: A Play With Four Sides ”; “ The Bobbed-Hair
Bandit ,” about a Brooklyn couple’s 1924 crime spree; “ The
Booby Prize ,” an “uplifting” one-woman show, and “ The
F***ing World According to Molly ,” about a poet-slash-security
guard with bed bugs and other issues.  There’s also “ Gleeam ,” a musical comedy that promises to
combine TV’s “Glee” with the “Scream” thriller franchise.  Through Aug. 28 at venues around the city. Information:

has become such a phenomenally popular band. Listen to their
appealing blend of folk rock and indie pop, along with some of
the near-countertenor vocals that are all the rage today (see
Grizzly Bear, Fleet Foxes, Beach House, etc.).  Also appearing are label mates Ducktails, along with White
Fence and Widowspeak.  6 Delancey St. Information: +1-212-533-2111;

afternoon features two oddities worth attending: A post-brunch-
friendly 4 p.m. concert, and a chance to hear Handel’s mind-
bending, virtually neo-modernist opera “Orlando.”  The players are  San Francisco ’s  Philharmonia Baroque
Orchestra , and the singers are led by Clint van der Linde in the
title role.  Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, Broadway at 66th
Street. Information: +1-212-721-6500;

Boulud Sud, a tribute to his hometown of Lyons,  France , and a
temple of sunny Mediterranean classics like planked octopus and
baked cod. 20 W. 64th St.; +1-212-595-1313.  Adventurous jazz singer Jane Monheit returns to familiar
leaves in the American songbook. By her side is Mark O’Connor, a
music polymath of extraordinary range: composer of contemporary
longhair music, classical violinist and swing musician of
thrilling dexterity. They’re closing out a brief run at the  Blue
Note  with a set that’s sure to end your weekend on a high note.  131 W. 3rd St. Information: +1-212-475-8592;
