Turkey ’s lira gained after the
central bank offered to sell $100 million, the most it has
offered since the sales began a week ago, and said it may
increase the amount gradually in the coming days.  The lira rose 0.2 percent to 1.7789 per dollar at 11:32
a.m., after declining as much as 0.7 percent earlier, and
trimmed this week’s loss to 2 percent.  The central bank will increase the amount of dollars it
sells “if necessary,” governor Erdem Basci said in an e-mailed
statement from Ankara today.  The lira’s appreciation “stems from the market perception
that the central bank does not want the lira below the current
levels,” Tufan Comert, a strategist at Garanti Securities, said
in a note to investors.  The lira lost 7 percent against the dollar in the past
month, making it the worst-performing emerging market currency.
The government-run employment fund Iskur sold $34 million for
liras today, CNBC-e television reported.  Benchmark two-year bond yields increased one basis point,
or 0.01 of a percentage point, to 8.11 percent, according to the
RBS Istanbul Benchmark Bond Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
