France ’s stock market regulator
opened an investigation into speculation that affected trading
in shares of  Societe Generale (GLE)  SA, said the agency’s president,
Jean-Pierre Jouyet.  Societe Generale, France’s second-largest bank, on Aug. 10
denied “all market rumors” and asked France’s Autorite des
Marches Financiers to open a probe. Speculation that France’s
creditworthiness was in doubt sent the shares tumbling 15
percent that day.  “We’re investigating the unfounded rumors that hit
specific stocks this week,” Jouyet said in an interview on  RTL
Radio  today. “I can tell you that the secretary general of the
AMF, Thierry Francq, has opened an investigation into the rumors
that affected Societe Generale.”  France, Spain, Italy and Belgium banned short-selling of
financial stocks beginning today. The ban is aimed at
stabilizing the market, reducing the volatility in some stocks
and preventing manipulation based on false rumors, Jouyet said
in the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
