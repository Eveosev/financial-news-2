Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , the Hong Kong-
based supplier of energy, food and mining commodities, bought
five iron-ore shipments from  Ferrous Resources Ltd.  as China
boosts its imports of the steelmaking material.  Noble bought 750,000 metric tons to be delivered between
next month and January, Ferrous Chief Financial Officer Andre
Simao said in a telephone interview late yesterday. Four trading
companies bid for the cargoes, with Noble offering the best
conditions, he said, declining to name the other participants.  China, the world’s biggest consumer of iron ore, boosted
ore imports by 6.8 percent in July to 54.55 million metric tons
as steelmakers replenished stockpiles.  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-
based Ferrous is competing with miners including Vale SA and MMX
Mineracao & Metalicos SA in boosting iron ore sales and output.  “This is very good for Ferrous to position itself in the
international market,” Simao said of the deal, without
providing financial details of the transaction.  Stephen Brown , Noble’s investor relations director, said in
email that the company declined to comment on its business.  To contact the reporter on this story:
