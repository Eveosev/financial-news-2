Alastair Cook â€™s unbeaten double
century helped England extend its lead to 279 runs over  India  in
their third cricket Test.  Cook has scored 206 as England reached 503-3 before rain
brought an early lunch on day three at Edgbaston in Birmingham.
Eoin Morgan is 66 not out for the hosts, who began the day 456-
3. India was bowled out for 224 in its first innings.  England won the first two Tests in the four-match
series. It can replace India as No. 1 in the International
Cricket Council rankings with another victory or by drawing the
final two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
