Japanese stocks declined, extending
losses on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average for a third week, after
the government cut its forecast for the country’s economic
growth and as concern grew  Europe ’s debt crisis will spread.  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the world’s biggest carmaker, fell 1.1
percent after IHS Automotive reduced its forecast for U.S. auto
sales. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co., which gets 26 percent
of sales from China, dropped 2.1 percent after a report mainland
regulators have introduced new curbs on real estate loans. Canon
Inc., the world’s biggest camera maker, climbed 5.6 percent
after announcing a share buyback.  The Nikkei 225 lost 0.2 percent to 8,963.72 at the 3:00 p.m.
close in  Tokyo . The gauge dropped 3.6 percent this week as
sentiment weakened amid signs Europe’s debt crisis may be
spreading and after  Standard & Poor’s  cut the U.S. credit rating.
The broader Topix index slid 0.4 percent today to 768.19.  “Investors are losing confidence,”  Naoki Fujiwara , who
helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “The recovery is looking weak and investors are
concerned about the earnings outlook.”  Japanese stocks reversed early gains after the government
cut its forecast for economic growth this year to 0.5 percent
from 1.5 percent as a record earthquake disrupted output and
depressed  consumer spending .  U.S. Car Sales  The nation’s top car manufacturers declined after IHS
Automotive reduced its forecast for U.S. auto sales this year by
200,000 units to 12.5 million light vehicles. Analyst  Rebecca Lindland  also cut her forecast for 2012 deliveries to 13.5
million vehicles from 14.7 million.  Toyota slid 1.1 percent to 2,819 yen. Honda Motor Co.,
which counts  North America  as its biggest market, fell 1.3
percent to 2,537 yen. Nissan Motor Co., which gets 33 percent of
sales from the U.S. and  Canada , declined 2.3 percent to 693 yen.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index dropped 1.2
percent today. The gauge surged 4.6 percent in  New York 
yesterday, reversing the previous day’s decline, after claims
for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped last week to
a four-month low. Stocks in the U.S. also rose after better-
than-estimated earnings from companies including Cisco Systems
Inc., the world’s largest maker of networking equipment, and
Rupert Murdoch’s News Corp.  Fundamentals?  “The latest U.S. jobs data and earnings results are a
reasonable indicator of the health of the economy and may
suggest that things are not as dire as the markets had feared,”
said Prasad Patkar, who helps manage the equivalent of $1.7
billion at Sydney-based Platypus Asset Management Ltd. “However,
fundamentals are not really driving stock markets at the moment
To a large extent, we may be getting a bounce because they are
oversold.”  Stocks also fell after a report that the  China  Banking
Regulatory Commission last month told banks to set significantly
higher standards on loans for commercial properties. China is
 Japan ’s biggest export market.  Hitachi Construction Machinery dropped 2.1 percent to 1,470
yen. Komatsu Ltd., a construction machinery maker that gets 23
percent of sales from China, lost 0.8 percent to 2,005 yen.  A global selloff that has erased more than $7 trillion from
world markets since July 26 has cut share prices to a level
where some investors are seeing bargains, said Shinkin Asset’s
Fujiwara. Japan’s Topix has plunged 11 percent this month,
reducing the price of companies on the index to 0.90 times
estimated book value, the lowest level since March 2009. A
number below one means investors can buy companies for less than
the value of their assets.  ‘Price Attractively’  “Japanese stocks are priced attractively,” Fujiwara said.
“Investors are looking to buy on dips but the potential for
earnings growth is weak so nobody’s going to chase prices
higher.”  Among stocks that rose, Canon surged 5.6 percent to 3,590
yen, its biggest advance since May 26. The maker of PowerShot
and Ixus compact cameras will buy back as many as 15 million
shares for as much as 50 billion yen ($651 million) between
today and Sept. 16, according to a statement to the Tokyo Stock
Exchange yesterday after the market closed. The stock has lost
15 percent this year.  Dai-Ichi Life Insurance Co. climbed 2.2 percent to 93,000
yen after saying first-quarter net income more than tripled to
32.3 billion yen from 10.4 billion yen a year earlier.  Of the 1,466 companies that reported earnings since July 11,
203 surpassed analyst estimates, while 121 fell short, according
to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  has fallen 12 percent this year through
yesterday compared with a 6.8 percent decline for the  S&P 500 
and a 16 percent drop for the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Shares on
the benchmark Japanese index were valued at 14.9 times estimated
earnings on average, compared with 11.8 times for the S&P 500
and 9.4 for the Stoxx 600.  To contact the reporter on this story:
