European coal rose for a third day
on speculation demand may strengthen because the fuel is a
cheaper alternative to natural gas.  Thermal coal burned to make electricity climbed 65 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to $127 a metric ton by 5:44 p.m. in  London , on
course for the highest close since Aug. 3. Coal appears to be
“relatively cheap compared to gas power,” Mark Pervan, an
analyst at Australia & New Zealand banking Group Ltd., said in a
report today.  Natural gas futures for September delivery slipped 0.2
percent to $4.101 for a million British thermal units on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . Prices yesterday rose the most since
July 15 after a government report showed a smaller-than-forecast
gain in U.S. inventories.  European coal prices are also supported by regional
restocking demand,  Barclays Capital  said in a report today.  Coal from Europe outperformed the commodity from South
Africa, the report showed. Coal for delivery next year from
Richards Bay in  South Africa , known as API4, rose 0.3 percent
yesterday to $119.15 a metric ton.  Prices will fall further in the current quarter on a supply
glut, according to the report. Coal from South Africa is more
expensive than other sources, the bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
