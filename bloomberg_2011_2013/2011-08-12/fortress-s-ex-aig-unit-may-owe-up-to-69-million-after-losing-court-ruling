Fortress Investment Group LLC (FIG) ’s
lender acquired from  American International Group Inc. (AIG)  may owe
as much as $68.7 million after losing a state court ruling over
laws designed to protect mortgage borrowers.  A South Carolina judge issued an interim order on July 29
saying that a class of 9,157 people could recover damages
through a law that entitles customers to select “who will
represent the borrower in closing the loan,” Springleaf Finance
Corp. said today in a regulatory filing. The penalty could be
$1,500 to $7,500 per person, according to the filing from
Evansville, Indiana-based Springleaf, which was called American
General Finance when it was owned by AIG.  Fortress, the buyout and hedge-fund firm run by Dan Mudd,
agreed to buy 80 percent of the lender last year for $125
million. New York-based AIG sold units as Chief Executive
Officer  Robert Benmosche , 67, worked to repay bailout funds and
attract private investors to replace the U.S. Treasury
Department’s majority stake.  Springleaf “is defending the case vigorously,” the lender
said in the filing.  The court will issue a final order, which will include a
ruling on the plaintiff’s request for penalties, interest and
attorneys’ fees, according to the filing. The suit was filed in
1996, according to Springleaf, and AIG bought the firm in 2001.  A spokesman for New York-based Fortress couldn’t
immediately be reached for comment. AIG’s Mark Herr declined to
comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
