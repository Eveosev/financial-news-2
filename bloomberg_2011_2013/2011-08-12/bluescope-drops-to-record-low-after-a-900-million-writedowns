BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL) ,  Australia ’s
largest steelmaker, fell to a record low in Sydney after saying
it will write down the value of its assets by about A$900
million ($925 million) because of higher costs and lower prices.  The shares fell 7.7 percent to 90.5 Australian cents at the
4:10 p.m. local time close in Sydney, taking their decline to 60
percent this year, compared with the benchmark stock index’s 12
percent drop.  The close was the lowest since the steelmaker was spunoff
from BHP Billiton Ltd. in 2002 at a value of A$2.80 a share.  The Melbourne-based company expects to record a “small”
loss in the second half when it reports earnings on Aug. 22
after costs jumped due to increased raw material costs, a high
Australian dollar and low prices, it said in a stock exchange
filing after the market closed yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
