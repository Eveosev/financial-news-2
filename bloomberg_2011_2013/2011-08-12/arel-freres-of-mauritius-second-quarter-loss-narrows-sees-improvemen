Harel Freres Ltd. (HFRERES) , a Mauritian
company with interests in sugar and energy, said its loss
narrowed in the second quarter as revenue advanced and it
forecast an improved performance for the remainder of the year.  The company’s loss fell to 21.8 million rupees ($775,442)
in the three months through June from 46.4 million rupees a year
earlier, it said in a  statement  published on the Port Louis-
based Stock Exchange of Mauritius’s website today. Revenue
advanced 12 percent to 711.7 million rupees.  “We expect overall performance for 2011 to be better than
last year,” the company said. “The profitability of our energy
and commercial activities should improve during the second
semester, while losses suffered to date by our sugar activity
will be substantially reduced.”  Harel Freres is the Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest
producer of specialty sugars that include muscovado and demerara
varieties, and is targeting output of 85,000 metric tons this
year, Jean Arthur Pilot-Lagesse, the general manager of its cane
milling unit, said July 13. Sugar cane is the country’s main
crop, making up 80 percent of land under cultivation, according
to the Chamber of Agriculture.  The loss for the six months through June narrowed to 73.9
million rupees from 118.9 million rupees a year earlier, Harel
Freres said. Revenue climbed 15 percent to 1.39 billion rupees.  The stock gained 1.3 percent to 38.20 rupees by the 1:30
