U.S. Gulf oil premiums weakened as
the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to Brent
was little changed.  The gap widened 35 cents to $22.65 a barrel, below the Aug.
10 record of $23.79. When Brent declines versus WTI, it weakens
the value of low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West
African oil priced against the European benchmark.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium narrowed $1.10 to $20.90 a
barrel at 1:55 p.m. in  New York , according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Heavy Louisiana Sweet added 50 cents to $23.25 a
barrel over WTI.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed 75 cents to $19 while Poseidon’s shrank 5 cents
to $18.95 a barrel.  Southern Green Canyon dropped 75 cents to $18 a barrel over
WTI. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 3 cents to 88 cents
below the benchmark. Thunder Horse’s premium slipped $1 to
$22.25.  The premium for Syncrude gained 40 cents to $14.90 a
barrel. Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived
from the  tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select widened 5 cents to
$13.35.  To contact the reporter on this story:
