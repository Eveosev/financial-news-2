Tsingtao Brewery Co.,  China ’s
second-largest brewer, said first-half profit rose 22 percent as
it made more beer to cater to growing demand in the world’s most
populous nation.  Net income rose to 989.9 million yuan ($155 million), or
0.733 yuan a share, from 813.9 million yuan, or 0.602 yuan, a
year earlier, beating the 971 million yuan median of five
analysts’ estimates in a Bloomberg News survey. Sales climbed 21
percent to 12 billion yuan, Tsingtao said in a filing to  Hong
Kong ’s stock exchange yesterday.  Tsingtao is competing against rivals, including  SABMiller
Plc (SAB)  and  China Resources Enterprise Ltd. (291)  in China, by increasing
production and introducing more offerings. It said yesterday it
aims for annual beer sales of 100 million hectoliters in 2014.  Beer output in China, the world’s largest maker of the
alcoholic beverage, was 44.8 million kiloliters in 2010 and is
expected to increase 4 percent annually over the next five
years, according to Wei Huang, an analyst with CITIC Securities
Research.  Per capita beer consumption in China was 33.4 liters in
2010, a third of that in Western Europe and the gap implies room
for expansion, Huang wrote in a June 14 note.  Tsingtao fell 0.5 percent to close at HK$48.45 in Hong Kong
trading yesterday, before the earnings announcement. The stock
has climbed 19 percent this year, compared with a 15 percent
decline in the benchmark  Hang Seng Index. (HSI)   To contact the editor responsible for this story:
