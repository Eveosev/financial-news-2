Citadel LLC, the $11 billion hedge
fund run by  Ken Griffin , raised its stake in  Evercore Partners
Inc. (EVR)  to 5.2 percent as it ends a three-year effort to build its
own investment bank.  Citadel holds 1.38 million shares in Evercore, the New
York-based investment bank co-founded by  Roger Altman , the firm
said today in a regulatory filing. The hedge fund, which
previously owned about 210,500 shares of Evercore, is now the
company’s second-largest shareholder after mutual-fund manager
 Fidelity Investments , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Griffin, who is based in Chicago, is disbanding Citadel
Securities, the business he started in late 2008 to offer
underwriting, stock, bond and derivatives trading, and advice on
mergers, acquisitions and restructurings, people familiar with
the matter said yesterday. The New York-based unit, whose
efforts were hampered by executive turnover, will now focus on
providing electronic trading to institutions and on its market-
making business, the people said.  Officials at Citadel and Evercore declined to comment on
the filing, which categorized the hedge fund’s stake as passive.  To contact the reporter on this story:
