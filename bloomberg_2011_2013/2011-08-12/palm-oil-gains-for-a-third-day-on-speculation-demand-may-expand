Palm oil  advanced for a third day as
demand for the tropical oil, used in food and biofuels, was seen
rising amid tightening supply of competing vegetable oils.  October-delivery palm oil gained as much as 1.1 percent to
3,025 ringgit ($1,008) a metric ton on the Malaysia Derivatives
Exchange and closed at 3,015 ringgit a ton in Kuala Lumpur. The
most-active contract fell for a third week, losing 1.2 percent.  India , the world’s largest palm oil buyer, may boost
imports to a record, gaining 10 percent to about 7 million tons
in the year ending Oct. 31 from a year ago, as rising incomes
boost demand for processed food, according to a Bloomberg News
survey of five processors and analysts.  “If their local crop is having some problems, they would
need to import more,” driving prices higher, Donny Khor, a
senior vice president for futures and options at OSK Investment
Bank Bhd., said by phone from  Kuala Lumpur  today.  The area of monsoon-sown peanut in India may decline 10
percent from 4.98 million hectares last year, as farmers
switched to planting cotton after prices of the fiber surged to
a record, according to GG Patel & Nikhil Research Co.  That may push the nation’s imports because peanut produces
more oil than soybeans, said B.V. Mehta, executive director of
the Solvent Extractors’ Association of India.  Stockpiles Drop  Strong demand in emerging markets and the growing
popularity of palm oil in developed countries, as well as the
limited supply of other vegetable oils will keep the market
“resilient,” Golden Agri-Resources Ltd., the world’s largest
oil palm planter, said in a statement yesterday.  Stockpiles of palm oil in  Malaysia , the world’s second-
largest producer, dropped to 2 million tons in July from 2.05
million tons in June, the Malaysian Palm Oil Board said on Aug.
10. That was lower than the median estimate of 2.07 million tons
in a Bloomberg survey of three analysts and two plantation
companies. Output slipped 0.1 percent to 1.75 million tons,
while exports rose 9.1 percent to a record 1.73 million tons,
the board said.  Soybeans for delivery in November gained as much as 0.8
percent to $13.42 per bushel in  Chicago , before trading little
changed at $13.3125 at 6:14 p.m. Singapore time.  Soybean oil  for
December delivery climbed as much as 0.8 percent to 55.02 cents
per pound.  Palm oil for May delivery added 0.1 percent to 8,774 yuan
($1,372) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity Exchange  and soybean oil
for delivery in the same month ended little changed 9,968 yuan a
ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
