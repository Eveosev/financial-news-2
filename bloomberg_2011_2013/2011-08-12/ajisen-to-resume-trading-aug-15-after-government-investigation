Ajisen ( China ) Holdings Ltd., the
restaurant chain being investigated by the government for how it
discloses the nutritional content of its soup, said it will
resume trading on Aug. 15.  The company, which was suspended from trading on the Hong
Kong Stock Exchange Aug. 5, also disclosed the production
process and supply chain for its soup, in a filing yesterday. It
also said it closed a processing plant earlier this month in the
eastern city of Xiamen and shifted production to a facility in
Dongguan in southern China’s Guangdong province.  The closure was related to an expired catering license and
“no penalty in respect of food safety has been imposed on
Xiamen Processing Centre by regulatory authorities,” the filing
said.  The Hong Kong-based restaurant chain is assisting an
investigation by China’s commerce ministry into the
“inappropriate” description of the nutritional-content test of
its soup base.  Ajisen had dropped 40 percent since July 22, the last
trading day before  China Daily , citing other media reports, said
it used powder and instant seasoning to make its soup. The
company said on July 26 it used pig bones to make a soup
concentrate that shops dilute.  The restaurant operator in an Aug. 11 filing apologized
“for the concern in relation to the calcium content of the soup
base caused by our previous misinterpretation” of the report
from China Agricultural University.  Ajisen pledged to comply with applicable laws and to make
only “true and legitimate” statements in its food
advertisements. It also promised to assume liability for any
 food-safety  problems and not to use unauthorized or excess
additives.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
