The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index, for
the first time since July 2010, is close to producing a “dead
cross” chart usually seen as bearish. If history is a guide,
investors should ignore the signal, Piper Jaffray Cos. said.  The 50-day moving average for the equity benchmark slipped
to 1,285.91 yesterday, about 0.2 point above the average price
for the prior 200 days. Technical analysts, who study price
charts to predict market moves, call it a “dead cross” when a
50-day average moves lower than a 200-day average while both are
falling, and say that it shows a deterioration in trends.  Craig W. Johnson, a technical market strategist with Piper
Jaffray, found that the S&P 500’s 50-day moving average has
broken below its 200-day average 16 times since 1978. In 11
cases, the benchmark had positive returns over the next month,
with gains averaging 0.82 percent. During the month before the
signals, the index lost 1.77 percent.  “You tend to do most of the damage to the market before
the actual cross occurs,” Johnson said in a telephone interview
from  Minneapolis . “It’s more of a psychological negative
barrier than anything else.”  The last time the S&P 500 produced a “dead cross” on July
2, 2010, the index was at a 10-month low, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg and Piper Jaffray. The index rallied 33
percent through the end of April this year.  The S&P 500 dropped 7.2 percent last week, the most since
November 2008, as concerns grew the economy is headed for a
recession. The benchmark rallied 4.6 percent yesterday as an
unexpected drop in jobless claims and better-than-estimated
corporate earnings tempered concern  Europe ’s debt crisis is
worsening.  To contact the reporter on this story:
