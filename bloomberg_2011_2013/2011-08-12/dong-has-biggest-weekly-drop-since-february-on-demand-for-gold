The Vietnamese dong had its biggest
weekly decline since February as a surging domestic gold price
pushed up demand for dollars.  Local prices reached a record high of 46 million dong
($2,210) per tael, or 1.2 ounces, this week. That was more than
the $1,761.70 per ounce that gold futures for December delivery
were fetching on the Comex in  New York  today. The central bank
is permitting companies to import up to five metric tons of the
metal to take advantage of the price differential, boosting
demand for dollars, the central bank said on Aug. 9.  “Companies need dollars to import gold,” said Luu Hai Yen,
a Hanoi-based fixed-income analyst at Thang Long Securities
Joint-Stock Co. “Demand for dollars is expected to rise from now
to the end of the year.”  The dong fell 1 percent this week to 20,812 per dollar as
of 3:34 p.m. in Hanoi, the biggest weekly decline since Feb. 11,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It was unchanged today.  The  State Bank  of  Vietnam  set the dong-dollar  reference
rate  at 20,618 today, according to its website. The dong is
allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either side of the fixing.  The yield on Vietnam’s five-year bonds fell four basis
points, or 0.04 percentage point, to 12.55 percent this week,
according to a daily fixing price from banks compiled by
Bloomberg. The rate declined one basis point today.  --Nguyen Kieu Giang in Hanoi. Editors: Andrew Janes, Simon Harvey  To contact the Bloomberg News Staff on this story:
