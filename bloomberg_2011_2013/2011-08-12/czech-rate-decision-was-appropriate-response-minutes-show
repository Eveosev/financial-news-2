The Czech central bank said it was
“appropriate” to leave  interest rates  at current levels amid
concerns about slowing growth and  Europe ’s growing debt
problems.  The Ceska Narodni Banka board voted 5-2 in Prague on Aug. 4
to leave the two-week repurchase rate at a record-low 0.75
percent for a 14th month, with board member  Eva Zamrazilova  and
Kamil Janacek casting votes for a quarter-point increase, the
bank said in minutes from the meeting.  “The prevailing opinion was that the risks of the
inflation forecast were balanced and the appropriate monetary
policy response was to leave rates at the current level,” the
bank said in the minutes, published on its website today.  The euro area’s debt crisis, which is threatening to spread
to  Italy , has prompted central banks across Europe to keep
borrowing costs on hold after raising rates earlier this year to
curb inflation. Even with the Czech economy expanding faster
than projected, a rate increase is not needed as demand-driven
inflation remains under control and the outlook for the euro
area’s economy is risky, economists said.  The Czech central bank board debated the risks presented by
slowing growth and Europe’s growing debt crisis and the need to
remain alert to inflationary pressures building in the economy,
the minutes showed.  Second-Round Effects  Some members on the board argued that inflationary
pressures from commodity and food prices was “greater than
their share in  consumer spending  and that the second-round
effects of” a planned increase in the value-added tax “might
also have an effect on inflation expectations.”  “The opinion was repeatedly expressed that the current
level of monetary policy rates was low and that it was desirable
to return to a neutral rate level,” the minutes showed. “It
was said that keeping rates low for an extended period could
represent a risk from the point of view of financial stability
in the future.”  The Czech public finance deficit is seen at 3 percent of
gross domestic product in 2012 and narrowing to a deficit of
2.8 percent in 2013, according to the bank’s new inflation
forecast also released today.  Debt to GDP is expected to expand to 41.8 percent in 2012
and 42.4 percent in 2013, the forecast showed.  Czech net exports will remain the main source of growth for
the economy this year and employment will remain “stagnant” in
2011 before increasing slightly in 2013.  The second-round effects of the VAT increase proposed by
the government of Petr Necas next year are expected to be
“insignificant,” the new forecast said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
