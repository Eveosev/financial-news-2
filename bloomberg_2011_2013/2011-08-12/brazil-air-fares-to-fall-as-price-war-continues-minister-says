Brazilian airlines will continue
cutting air fares as competition increases and other companies
may enter the market, said Wagner Bittencourt, the nation’s
civil aviation minister.  The reduction in tickets continued during the high season
in July and after  Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (GOLL4)  announced
the acquisition of Webjet Linhas Aereas SA last month, the
minister said.  “The price war will go on, and that’s good for
passengers,” Bittencourt said in an interview at the Bloomberg
office in  Sao Paulo  yesterday.  Average air ticket prices  in  Brazil  in May were the lowest
since records began in 2002, according to the latest data
provided by the civil aviation regulator, or Anac. Fares fell
8.4 percent from May 2010, while airlines yields tumbled 22
percent in the same period.  Passenger demand for air travel in Brazil as measured by
miles purchased grew 21 percent in the first half over the same
period last year, following a 24 percent increase in 2010,
according to Anac.  Air travel  expanded at a pace more than 3
times faster than the Brazil’s economy growth in 2010, the
fastest in more than two decades. In June alone, demand rose 20
percent, said Anac, compared with a 1.4 percent increase in
 Mexico , according to that country’s communications and
transportation secretariat.  Gol dropped 59 percent in Sao Paulo trading this year
before today, the worst performance among the 66 members of
Brazil’s benchmark index, while Tam fell 29 percent. The Bovespa
index lost 23 percent in the period.  To contact the reporters on this story:
