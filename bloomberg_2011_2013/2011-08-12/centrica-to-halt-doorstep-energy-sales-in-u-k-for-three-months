Centrica Plc’s British Gas unit will
halt doorstep energy sales for an initial three-month period,
the company said.  “Doorstep selling, in its current form, is no longer a
sustainable way to engage or build a relationship with
customers,” Ian Peters, managing director of energy at British
Gas, said today in a statement on its website. “We want the
energy advice we give our customers to be trusted and delivered
at a time and place that is convenient to them.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
