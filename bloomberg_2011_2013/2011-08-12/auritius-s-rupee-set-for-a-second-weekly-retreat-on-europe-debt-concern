Mauritius’s rupee is heading for a
second week of declines against the dollar as governments
struggle to contain the debt crisis in  Europe , the nation’s main
trading partner, curbing demand for riskier assets.  The currency weakened for a second day, retreating as much
as 0.6 percent to 28.25 rupees per dollar and traded 0.1 percent
down to 28.125 by 1:37 p.m. in  Port Louis , the capital, taking
its drop this week to less than 0.1 percent. Versus the euro,
the rupee slipped 0.4 percent to 40.0929.  Banks’ overnight borrowings from the  European Central Bank 
surged to the highest in three months yesterday, a sign some
lenders might have need for emergency cash. Citigroup Inc., DBS
Group Holdings Ltd. and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. said they
haven’t cut credit lines to French lenders, in response to
speculation that some banks are becoming reluctant to lend to
them amid Europe’s sovereign debt crisis.  The euro weakened against the dollar “as concerns over
French banks increase, with rumors that an Asian bank has cut
the credit lines to French banks, and five others were
considering following suit,” analysts at Port Louis-based
 Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB)  wrote in an e-mailed note to clients.  The rupee closely tracks the euro’s movements against the
dollar, with an average correlation of 0.8 this month. A value
of 1 would mean they move in lock step.  Almost a third of visitors to the French-speaking island
are from Europe’s second-largest economy.  Buying prices for the dollar ranged between 27.3892 to
27.5578 rupees, while the selling price was 28.8588 per dollar.
