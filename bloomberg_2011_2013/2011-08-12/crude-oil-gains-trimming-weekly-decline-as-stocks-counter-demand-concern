Oil rose in  New York , paring this
week’s decline, as data showing higher U.S. retail sales during
July assuaged concerns that the global recovery is fading.  Oil reversed losses today as European equities and U.S.
stock-index futures climbed. Retail sales in the U.S. climbed in
July by the most in four months, showing consumers are holding
up even as employment slows.  France ’s economy failed to grow in
the second quarter and manufacturing in the euro region
unexpectedly declined in June, reports today showed.  “The market is pricing in a double-dip recession, and our
economists definitely don’t see a double-dip just around the
corner,” said Amrita Sen, an analyst at Barclays Plc in  London .
“The data has been holding up okay.”  Crude for September delivery on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange  was up $1.27, or 1.5 percent, at $86.99 a barrel at
1:54 p.m. London time, after falling as much as $1.70 to $84.02.  Brent oil for September settlement on the London-based ICE
Futures Europe exchange advanced 0.7 percent to $108.77. Earlier
it fell as much as $1.16, or 1.1 percent, to $106.86 a barrel.
The European benchmark contract was at a premium of $22.56 to
U.S. futures, down from a record close of $23.79 on Aug. 10.  To contact the reporters on this story:
