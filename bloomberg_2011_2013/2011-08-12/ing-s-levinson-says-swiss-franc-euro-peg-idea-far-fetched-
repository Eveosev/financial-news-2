Tom Levinson, a foreign-exchange
strategist at ING Groep NV, commented about  currency markets  in
a telephone interview from  London .  On the Swiss franc:  “It would be very difficult to achieve the sorts of things
that have been circulating in the market over the last 24 hours.
People have been talking about a temporary peg at 1.15 in euro-
Swiss. We struggle to see how that would operate and in fact it
would probably heap a whole load more pressure on the Swiss
franc, because markets would just target it.  “The things that we see as more realistic are just
continued swamping of liquidity, Swiss franc liquidity,
quantitative easing in the form of purchases of corporate bonds,
less exciting things than the peg idea, which is probably a bit
far-fetched.”  On the euro versus the dollar:  “There are some pretty strong dollar impulses out there,
which over time should see the dollar struggle, but in the near
term there’s a very elevated risk of financial-sector contagion
reintensifying, and that would of course be a dollar-positive.  “In those volatile moments of stress rising, that favors
the  U.S. dollar  and keeps euro-dollar lower and risks it
dropping down to 1.40 or so.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
