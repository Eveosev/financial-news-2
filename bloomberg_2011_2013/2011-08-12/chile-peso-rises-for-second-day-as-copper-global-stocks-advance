Chile ’s peso rose for a second day
as copper and global stocks advanced after U.S. government data
showed an increase in retail sales last month.  The peso climbed 0.1 percent to 470.73 pesos per U.S.
dollar at 1:32 p.m. New York time, from 471.15 yesterday. It
fell 1.2 percent for the week.  “The improvement in copper prices is an improvement in
Chile’s terms of trade, which puts appreciative pressure on the
peso,”  Osvaldo Cruz , an economist at Banco de Credito e
Inversiones, said in a telephone interview from Santiago. “The
decrease in  risk aversion  in the markets means investors are
more apt to bet on emerging market currencies.”  Copper, which accounts for half of Chile’s exports, rose as
much as 1.2 percent to $4.08 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  U.S. stocks rose after data showed U.S. retail sales
climbed in July by the most in four months. European stocks
climbed, extending the Stoxx Europe 600 Index’s rally from a
two-year low, as France, Spain, Italy and Belgium imposed short-
selling bans.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ views of future rates, rose 10 basis points, or 0.10
percentage point, to 5.06 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
