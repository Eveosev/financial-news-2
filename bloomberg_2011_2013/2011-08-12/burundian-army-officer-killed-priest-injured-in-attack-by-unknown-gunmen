A Burundian army officer was killed
and three people were injured in an attack in the northwest of
the country by unidentified gunmen, said Jacques Kenese,
governor of the Bubanza province.  Those wounded in the Aug. 10 shooting, 30 kilometers (19
miles) north of the capital, Bujumbura, included a Catholic
priest, Kenese said in a phone interview yesterday. Two cars and
three motorcycles were burned in the incident, which may have
been carried out by armed bandits, he said.  The shooting follows a series of similar attacks in which
soldiers and policemen have been targeted by gunmen wearing
military uniforms, said Pierre Claver Mbonimpa, president of the
Association for Protection of Human Rights and Prisoners. The
attacks may be linked to the start of an armed rebellion in the
East African country, Niyoyankana Bonaventure, president of the
opposition Union for National Progress, told reporters on Aug.
10 in Bujumbura.  Burundi is rebuilding its economy after a decade-long civil
war that killed 300,000 people. Fighting broke out in 1993 when
the country’s first democratically elected president was
assassinated. The East African nation, one of the world’s
poorest, relies on coffee to generate two-thirds of its exports
and the industry is the main source of income for about 800,000
households, according to the  International Monetary Fund .  To contact the reporter on this story:
