India ’s benchmark stock index fell
for the eighth time in nine days as higher-than-expected growth
in factory output intensified concerns of a further increase in
borrowing costs, and as Asian equities declined.  Tata group companies led the losses. Tata Motors sank 5.8
percent after the owner of Jaguar  Land Rover  posted net income
of 20 billion rupees in the first quarter, which lagged behind
the 21.6 billion-rupee median of 32 analysts’ estimates compiled
by Bloomberg. Industrial output growth unexpectedly quickened in
June, rising 8.8 percent from a year ago following a revised 5.9
percent gain in May, a government report showed today.  Tata
Consultancy Services Ltd. (TCS) , the largest software services
provider, tumbled 3.3 percent.  “Investors are nervous,” said Kaushik Dani, a Mumbai-
based  fund manager  at Peerless Mutual Fund, which manages $1.1
billion in assets. “While the recent declines are seen as an
opportunity to buy stocks, the uncertainty in global markets is
keeping them cautious.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, lost
219.77, or 1.3 percent, to 16,839.63 at the 3:30 p.m. close in
Mumbai, the lowest close since June last year. The 30-stock
gauge slid 2.7 percent in the week, its third straight weekly
decline. The S&P CNX Nifty Index fell 1.3 percent to 5,072.95
today while its August futures traded at 5,074.50. The BSE 200
Index dropped 1.1 percent to 2,101.91.  The Sensex has retreated 18 percent in 2011, the worst
performer after  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index among major indexes in
the 10 biggest markets, on concern that higher borrowing costs
will erode earnings. Companies on the gauge are valued at 13.9
times estimated earnings, compared with a multiple of 9.8 for
the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Indian markets will remain closed Aug. 15 for Independence
Day holiday.  Global Growth Concerns  Asian stocks retreated for a second day, with technology
and electronics companies leading the decline.  About $7 trillion has been erased off from the value of
global equities since July 26 after S&P cut U.S.’s debt for the
first time, riots swept across Britain and  Europe ’s debt crisis
deepened. Data today showed French economic growth stalled last
quarter, while European industrial production unexpectedly fell
in June ahead of a report that may show U.S. consumer confidence
weakened.  Emerging-market equity funds posted the third-largest
weekly outflows on record with withdrawals of $7.7 billion in
the week ended Aug. 10, Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Markus
Rosgen said in a report today, citing figures compiled by EPFR
Global. That took total outflows for the year to $14 billion,
according to Citigroup.  Tata Group   Tata Motors sank 5.8 percent to 800 rupees, the steepest
decline on the Sensex today. The stock has retreated 16 percent
in August and is set for a fifth straight month of losses. Tata
Consultancy plummeted 3.2 percent to 947.15 rupees, the lowest
close in 10 months, while Tata Power Co., the nation’s largest
non-state generator, lost 3.5 percent to 1,085.5 rupees, the
lowest close in 25 months. Tata Steel Ltd., the nation’s top
producer of the alloy, retreated 2 percent to 474.95 rupees, the
lowest close in 13 months.  Infosys Ltd., the second-largest software maker, lost 2.7
percent to 2,375.2 rupees.  Wipro Ltd. (WPRO)  declined 2.8 percent to
342.95 rupees.  Earnings for the three months ended June reported by 11 out
of 24 Sensex companies, or 46 percent, have lagged behind
analyst estimates, according to Bloomberg data. That compares
with 33 percent that missed forecasts in the previous quarter.  The median of 23 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast factory output to grow 5.5 percent. The more-than-
expected expansion comes after government data yesterday showed
India’s food costs accelerated to a three-month high in the week
ended July 30. That maintains pressure on the  Reserve Bank  of
India, which has raised its repurchase rate 11 times since the
start of 2010, to continue tightening even amid the risk of a
global downturn.  “Investors would keenly look at the monthly inflation data
which comes out on Aug. 16 as that could define the central
bank’s move,” Dani of Peerless Mutual Fund said.  Foreign investors bought a net 2.49 billion rupees ($55
million) worth of local equities on Aug. 10, increasing their
investments in stocks this year to 47.8 billion rupees, data on
the  website  of the market regulator.  To contact the reporter on this story:
