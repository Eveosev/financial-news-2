Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  won dismissal of
a lawsuit by former salespeople who said the printer-maker
denied them tens of thousands of dollars in commissions because
of a malfunction in the company’s order-management system.  While HP may have underpaid or belatedly paid some of its
salespeople, the four ex-workers suing the company lacked
sufficient evidence that they were denied commissions or paid
late, said U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in a ruling today
that also denied the workers’ request to amend their lawsuit.  The complaint filed in federal court in San Francisco in
2009 alleged as many as 50,000 current and former salespeople
hadn’t received commissions and bonuses because of problems with
the software system that tracks sales, called Omega. Hewlett-
Packard said in August 2009 that about 2,000 members of its
global sales team of 23,000 were affected by the Omega glitch.
The company was working to fix the problem and the workers’
claims exaggerated the issue, HP said at the time.  Meghan Martinez, an attorney for the plaintiffs, didn’t
immediately return a voice-mail message seeking comment on the
ruling.  The case is Johnson v. Hewlett-Packard, 09-03596, U.S.
District Court, Northern District of  California  ( San Francisco ).  To contact the reporter on this story:
