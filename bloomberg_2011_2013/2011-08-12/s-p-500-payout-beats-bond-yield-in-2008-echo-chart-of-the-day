U.S. investors looking for income
might be better off with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index than
the 10-year Treasury note, as they were three years ago during
the depths of a financial crisis.  As the CHART OF THE DAY shows, the S&P 500 dividend yield
surpassed the 10-year yield this week for just the second time
since 1958. The first occurred in November 2008, mainly because
plunging share prices lifted the relative value of payouts by
companies in the index.  Falling bond yields were primarily responsible for the
latest crossover. The Treasury’s yield tumbled 89 basis points
in 12 days as investors sought a haven from a stock-market rout.
Each basis point amounts to 0.01 percentage point.  The decline ended with the 10-year yield at 2.11 percent
two days ago, when it dropped below the S&P 500 dividend yield.
The  stock index  yielded 2.32 percent. The relationship didn’t
last, as the Treasury yield closed about 12 basis points higher
yesterday.  “This may be more of a short-term event than in 2008,”
Kevin Pleines, an analyst at Birinyi Associates in Westport,
 Connecticut , said yesterday in an interview. “We were in real
trouble then.” Pleines helped put together a similar chart that
Birinyi published on Aug. 10.  November 2008 marked the start of a six-month period in
which the S&P 500’s dividend yield exceeded the note’s yield.
That stretch ended after stocks entered a  bull market , which
made payouts less valuable in relative terms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
