Wheat fell in  Chicago , paring a
third weekly climb, after the U.S. government raised its outlook
for global supplies on higher-than-expected production in Europe
and  Russia .  Global  output  will come to 672.1 million metric tons in the
2011-12 season, more than the 662.4 million tons estimated last
month, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday.
Stockpiles will be 188.9 million tons, up from 182.2 million
tons, it said. Wheat reached a two-week low on Aug. 9 as
commodities plunged after the U.S. lost its AAA credit rating.  “The gloomy financial context and large wheat stocks are
putting the prices under pressure,” Bourges, France-based farm
adviser  Offre et Demande Agricole  said on its website today.
“The harvest is progressing in  France  thanks to the improvement
of weather conditions.”  Wheat for December delivery dropped 3 cents, or 0.4
percent, to $7.30 a bushel by 12:08 p.m. Paris time on the
Chicago Board of Trade, cutting this week’s climb to 1 percent.
November-delivery milling wheat fell 1.50 euros, or 0.8 percent,
to 196 euros ($279) a ton on NYSE Liffe in France’s capital.  The wheat harvest in Russia, which ended an export ban last
month, will total 56 million tons, 3 million tons more than
estimated last month, the USDA said. The European Union’s crop
will reach 133.5 million tons, above the 132.1 million tons
forecast last month, it said.  Higher Stockpile Ratio  “The world wheat projections were bearish,”  Luke Mathews ,
a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , said
in a report today. The global stocks-to-use ratio of 28 percent
is “comfortably” higher than the 2007-08 level of about 20
percent, he said.  Corn for December delivery fell 2.5 cents, or 0.4 percent,
to $7.115 a bushel in Chicago after climbing as high as $7.20,
the highest price for the most-active contract since June 9.  Global harvests of corn will total 860.5 million tons in
the 2011-12 season, 11.9 million tons below last month’s
estimate, the USDA said, paring its output forecast for the U.S.
by 4.1 percent. Demand is predicted to outpace production by 8.4
million tons, more than the 5.2 million-ton deficit forecast in
July, the USDA data showed.  Production in the U.S., which is estimated to grow 38
percent of the world’s corn, will total 12.91 billion bushels
(328 million tons), compared with 13.47 billion projected in
July, the USDA said. The average prediction of 31 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey was for 13.08 billion bushels. Last year’s crop
was 12.45 billion bushels. The yield estimate was cut to 153
bushels an acre from 158.7 in July.  “With weather disappointing during both the U.S. planting
and growing season, prices will need to rally further to adjust
demand down to the lower available supplies,” Damien Courvalin
and  Allison Nathan , analysts at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said
in a report yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery were unchanged at $13.3175 a
bushel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
