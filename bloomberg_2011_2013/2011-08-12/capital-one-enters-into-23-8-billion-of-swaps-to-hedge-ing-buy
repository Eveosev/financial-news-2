Capital One Financial Corp. (COF) , the
lender that agreed to purchase ING Direct USA in June, entered
into swaps with a notional amount of $23.8 billion to reduce the
amount of required capital if interest rates rise.  “Since the date we entered into the agreement to acquire
ING Direct, interest rates have declined substantially, and our
current estimate of the fair value of the ING Direct net assets
and liabilities has increased correspondingly,” McLean,
Virginia-based Capital One said today in a filing. “The higher
the fair value of the net assets and liabilities, the lower the
amount of incremental capital needed to achieve a given
regulatory capital ratio.”  The swaps may add to earnings volatility as rates fluctuate,
the company said. If  interest rates  decline 50 basis points
across the yield curve, or 0.50 percentage points, from the time
the swaps were executed, other non-interest income may be
reduced by $400 million due to the swaps, the company estimated.
The decline in rates would also increase the value of ING’s net
assets and liabilities.  The swaps, executed on Aug. 8 and Aug. 9, will not count as
a hedge under accounting rules and will be marked to market
until they are terminated or expire, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
