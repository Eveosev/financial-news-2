Milk prices in the European Union
rose 13 percent in June from the same month a year earlier, LTO-
Nederland said in a report on its website today.  EU milk  rose to an average 34.63 euros ($49.37) for 100
kilograms (220.46 pounds) in June, up 98 cents from the prior
month, LTO-Nederland said. Prices at French dairies increased
the most, rising 10 percent to 35.26 euros at the Sodiaal dairy,
according to the report.  “For most of the dairies, the calculated milk price of
June is the highest average of June, at least that is, since the
start of the LTO International Milk Price Comparison,” the
company said in the report.  Milk buyers are hoping for lower prices in the next few
months on rising stockpiles, LTO-Nederland said. Global dairy
prices have dropped in the past month, according to the report.  “Buyers are holding back on committing large contracts due
to prices going downwards and are instead focusing on the
potential for increased milk production from Oceania as the
dairy season progresses,” the company said. “Expectations for
milk production growth in the Southern Hemisphere are high and
also the EU and U.S. forecasts are higher.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
