New Yorkers who complain they get a
raw deal from a high cost of living can take solace in paying
less for at least one item.  Los Angeles , not New York, has the most expensive sushi in
the U.S., according to the Sushinomics Cost-of-Living Index. The
measure, compiled by Bloomberg Rankings, was based on a survey
of prices for spicy tuna and  California  rolls at restaurants in
27 major cities.  Hirotaka Fujita, sushi chef and owner of  Jinpachi  in West
Hollywood, California, considered the findings ... fishy.  “Really?” Fujita said. “No. New York has to be the most
expensive.” He added that his price for a six-piece spicy tuna
roll was just $8.  After Los Angeles and New York,  San Francisco ,  Minneapolis 
and Austin,  Texas , rounded out the top five. At the bottom were
 Charlotte , North Carolina; Columbus,  Ohio ;  Portland ,  Oregon ; New
Orleans; and Princeton, New Jersey.  Bloomberg used the survey to find an average price for all
27 cities and then compared each locale to that figure. Los
Angeles scored 126.6 on the index, meaning sushi prices there
were about 27 percent above the average. New York rated 120.9,
and Princeton had the cheapest rolls with a rating of 72.9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
