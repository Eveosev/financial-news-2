AS Nordecon,  the second-biggest
publicly traded Baltic builder, said its second-quarter loss was
little changed as cost increases offset a rise in revenue.  The net loss fell to 2.5 million euros ($3.6 million) from
2.6 million euros a year earlier, the Tallinn, Estonia-based
company said in a stock exchange filing after the end of trade
yesterday. Revenue rose 40 percent to 37 million euros, Nordecon
said.  The cost of goods sold rose 39 percent, mainly because of
rising prices of raw materials, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
