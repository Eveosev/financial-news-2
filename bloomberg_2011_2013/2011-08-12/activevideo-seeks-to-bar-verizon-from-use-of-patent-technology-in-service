ActiveVideo Networks asked a judge
for a permanent injunction against  Verizon Communications Inc. (VZ) ,
the second-biggest U.S. phone company, to prevent the unlawful
use of its technology in Verizon’s FiOS TV service.  ActiveVideo, based in San Jose,  California , last week was
awarded $115 million in damages by the jury that heard its
patent-infringement suit against New York-based Verizon in
federal court in Norfolk, Virginia.  “We insist that Verizon immediately cease its unlawful use
of the patented technology developed by the employees and
investors of ActiveVideo Networks,” Jeff Miller, the company’s
chief executive officer, said in a statement today. The request
for the injunction was also filed today in Norfolk.  Miller said last week after the jury verdict that its legal
counsel would seek the court order.  The jury rejected ActiveVideo’s claims that Verizon’s
infringement of its patents was willful. The panel also awarded
the telecommunications company $16,000 in damages after finding
ActiveVideo had infringed two of its patents.  ActiveVide creates interactive television technology and
services, according to its complaint.  “ActiveVideo hasn’t shared a copy of its motion with us,”
Bill Kula, a spokesman for Verizon, said in a phone interview.
“There’s no basis for an injunction.”  The case is ActiveVideo Networks Inc. v. Verizon
Communications Inc., 10cv248, U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of  Virginia  (Norfolk).  To contact the reporter on this story:
