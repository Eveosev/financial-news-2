Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA)  has slowed an
oil leak from its Gannet Alpha platform in the U.K.’s North Sea.  Shell “stemmed the leak significantly” and is working to
isolate it,  Bill Tanner , a company spokesman, said today in an
e-mailed statement. The company deployed a remote-operated
vehicle after a light sheen was discovered and is managing a
leak in a flow line.  A subsea well has been shut and the flow line, which
connects oil from the well to processing equipment, is being
depressurized, Tanner said. Shell operates the facility, located
180 kilometers (112 miles) east of Aberdeen, Scotland.  Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM)  is a partner.  Shell is working with the regulator to assess the size of
the sheen and possible effects on other operations, Tanner said
in an interview. The platform’s other wells continue to produce
crude, he said.  -- Editors: Jasmina Kelemen, Susan Warren  To contact the reporter on this story:
