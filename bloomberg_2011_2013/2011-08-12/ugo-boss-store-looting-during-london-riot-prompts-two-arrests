Two teenagers were arrested in
 London  on suspicion they looted the  Hugo Boss AG (BOS)  store in
Chelsea’s Sloane Square and a nearby currency exchange during
riots this week.  The men, ages 16 and 17, were arrested today at homes in
the nearby Pimlico neighborhood on suspicion of violent
disorder, burglary and grievous bodily harm, London’s
Metropolitan Police said in an e-mailed statement. The teens are
also suspected of looting a jewelry shop on Pimlico Road in the
same area of town, police said.  Hugo Boss , the Metzingen, German-based luxury clothing
company, said in an e-mailed statement that all the store’s
windows were damaged and some clothing was stolen.  Confrontations between rioters and police in neighborhoods
throughout the capital began after an Aug. 6 protest over the
police shooting of north London resident Mark Duggan descended
into violence. A wave of rioting and looting has spread to other
cities around  England . Police in London have arrested more than
1,000 people and charged nearly 600.  In a search of one of the suspect’s homes this morning,
police found a machete, a mobile phone with pictures of the
third night’s riots and possibly stolen jewelry. The allegation
of bodily harm relates to a separate assault with a machete last
night in Westminster, police said.  Police said in a separate statement today that they
released five men on bail after they were arrested on suspicion
of arson at a  Sony Corp. (6758)  distribution center in north London.
Two of the men, arrested on Aug. 9, 10 and yesterday, were 17,
and the others were 18, 22 and 23 years old.  To contact the reporter on this story:
