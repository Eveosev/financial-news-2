The Austrian Financial Market

against  Immofinanz AG (IIA)  Chief Executive Officer Eduard Zehetner,
according to a statement from the company on DGAP newswire
today. Zehetner was initially accused of insider trading, the
statement said. The inquiry was closed because the alleged
offense wasn’t committed or isn’t “indictable” under the
agency’s rules, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
