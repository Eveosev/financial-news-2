Transatlantic Holdings Inc. (TRH) , the
reinsurer that’s received three takeover offers, started
discussions with  Warren Buffett ’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)  about
its $3.25 billion bid.  Transatlantic reached a confidentiality agreement with
Berkshire as it seeks a better offer than the one Buffett’s firm
made last week, the New York-based reinsurer said today in a
statement distributed by  Business Wire .  Transatlantic had previously agreed to merge with Allied
World Assurance Company Holdings AG and had shunned an offer
from  Validus Holdings Ltd. (VR)  Rivals are seeking to diversify their
operations and build capital by acquiring Transatlantic, which
trades for 74 percent of its book value.  Transatlantic declined 14 cents to $50.13 in New York Stock
Exchange composite trading today, and has risen 11 percent since
the close of trading on Aug. 5, the day of Berkshire’s offer.
Berkshire’s Class A shares climbed $500 to $107,600.  A spokeswoman for Allied declined to comment. Gemma Hart of
Validus had no immediate comment. Buffett didn’t return a
message left with an assistant at Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire.  To contact the reporter on this story:
