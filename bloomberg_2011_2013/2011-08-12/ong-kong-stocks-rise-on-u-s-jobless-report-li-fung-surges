Hong Kong’s  Hang Seng Index (HSI)  rose for
a second day this week as a drop in U.S. jobless claims eased
concern demand will slow in the world’s biggest economy,
boosting shares of exporters and commodity producers.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , a supplier of toys and clothes to retailers
including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., surged 7 percent, its steepest
gain in a year, after profit beat analyst estimates.  Techtronic
Industries Co. (669) , maker of Ryobi power tools and Hoover vacuum
cleaners, jumped 5.4 percent.  Cnooc Ltd. (883) , China’s No. 1 offshore
oil producer by market value, declined 0.6 percent, reversing
earlier gains, as crude prices fell today.  “The U.S. data indicated the economy may not be as bad as
before, and in very poor  market sentiment , any good news can
help move the market direction,” said  Castor Pang , head of
research at Core-Pacific Yamaichi International Ltd. in Hong
Kong. “Investors may be trying to close part of their short
positions, seeing the market has been oversold. But it’s still
questionable whether the overall market and economy can turn
around.”  The Hang Seng Index rose 0.1 percent to 19,620.01 at the
close, after rising as much as 1.8 percent and falling as much
as 0.1 percent. About as many stocks fell as advanced in the 46-
member gauge. The index fell 6.3 percent for the week, and is in
a  bear market  after tumbling more than 20 percent from its high
in November 2010. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
Chinese companies listed in  Hong Kong  declined 0.5 percent to
10,452.64.  Steepest Gain  Li & Fung jumped 7 percent to HK$12.84, the steepest gain
in the Hang Seng Index, after saying first-half profit fell 15
percent to $236 million, beating the $206 million average of
seven analysts’ estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Techtronic
increased 5.4 percent to HK$7.02.  Futures on the  Standard & Poor’s  500 Index slid 0.8 percent
today. In  New York , the index surged 4.6 percent yesterday as a
decline in jobless claims and better-than-estimated corporate
earnings tempered concern Europe’s debt crisis is worsening.  Claims for U.S. unemployment benefits unexpectedly dropped
last week to a four-month low, signaling the job market is being
hampered by a lack of hiring rather than more firings.  MTR Corp. (66) , Hong Kong’s urban rail operator, advanced 2.6
percent to HK$25.25 after saying first-half profit from
underlying business fell 24 percent to HK$4.4 billion ($564
million), beating the median HK$3.56 billion estimate of five
analysts in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Hang Seng Index posted its biggest two-week decline
since January 2009 after investors fled equities. The rout
deepened as Standard & Poor’s cut the U.S. credit-rating, China
reported disappointing economic figures and Europe’s debt crisis
showed signs of worsening. Shares on the index traded at 10.5
times forecast earnings, compared with 11.8 times for the  S&P
500 .  Oil Falls  Among stocks that fell, Cnooc Ltd., China’s No. 1 offshore
oil producer by market value, dropped 0.6 percent to HK$14.22
after rising as much as 2.7 percent. PetroChina Co., Asia’s
biggest company by market value, retreated 0.1 percent to
HK$9.36. Oil for September delivery fell as much as 2 percent in
New York today.  Anhui Conch Cement Co., a mainland maker of the building
material, slid 1.7 percent to HK$32.70, while rival producer
 China  National Building Material Co. sank 2.9 percent to
HK$12.96, extending their losses yesterday after Reuters
reported China cut its 2012 affordable housing development
target by 20 percent, citing two unidentified people close to
the government.  Futures on the Hang Seng Index increased 0.7 percent to
19,541. The HSI Volatility Index slumped 10 percent to 37.99,
indicating options traders expect a swing of 11 percent in the
Hang Seng Index in the next 30 days.  To contact the reporter on this story:
