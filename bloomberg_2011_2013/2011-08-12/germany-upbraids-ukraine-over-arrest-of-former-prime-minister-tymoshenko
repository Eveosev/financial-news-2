The German government criticized
Ukraine for the arrest of former Prime Minister  Yulia Tymoshenko 
and the treatment of members of her government, saying it will
watch events in the former Soviet republic “very closely.”  Germany ’s commissioner for human rights, Markus Loening,
warned the Ukraine that the arrest and charges against the
former premier, which include alleged obstruction of justice and
excessive payments for Russian natural gas in 2009, call into
question the country’s pledge to observe the rule of law.  “It is regrettable that the many trials against members of
the previous government take on the appearance of selective and
politically motivated justice,” Loening said in a statement
distributed by the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin today.
“The arrest of Yulia Tymoshenko, the former prime minister and
current opposition leader, has only bolstered this appearance.”  A Ukrainian court today declined to hear Tymoshenko’s
appeal challenging her arrest, a week after she was detained.
The District Court in Kiev ruled she had violated court
procedure and sought to obstruct a trial in which prosecutors
allege she abused her power and agreed to pay too much to buy
Russian natural gas in 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
