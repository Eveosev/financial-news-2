A-Tec Industries AG (ATEC) , the insolvent
Austrian machinery group, rose 15 percent in Vienna trading
after the company reported a first-half return to profit.  A-Tec closed 29.4 cents higher at 2.29 euros a share in the
Austrian capital, extending a 24 percent rise yesterday and
reaching the highest price in a month. That cut the drop this
year to 38 percent, giving the company a market value of 60.5
million euros ($86.2 million).  First-half net income was 24.6 million euros compared with
a net loss of 10.2 million euros a year earlier, the Vienna-
based company said late yesterday in a statement. The company
said its future depends on finding an investor and implementing
a restructuring plan that was agreed upon with creditors last
year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
