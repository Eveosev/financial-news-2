Porsche AG, the maker of the Cayenne
sport-utility vehicle, reported a 4 percent decline in auto
sales in July, burdened by a drop in demand for the aging 911
sports car.  Deliveries fell to 10,722 vehicles last month from 11,169 a
year earlier, the Stuttgart, Germany-based company said today in
a statement. The decline, which comes as Porsche prepares to
show a revamped version of the 911 at the Frankfurt Motor Show
in September, marked the first monthly drop in car sales since
May 2010, said Dirk Erat, a spokesman.  Porsche, which is being integrated into  Volkswagen AG (VOW)  as
part of a merger with parent company Porsche SE, aims to double
deliveries to at least 200,000 cars and SUVs by 2018 by adding
models and expanding in emerging markets. Luxury-car brands tend
to be more resistant to industrywide sales declines than mass-
market manufacturers because their customers still have money
even when economic growth slows.  “We are looking confidently at the next few months and
believe that new vehicles like the Panamera diesel will underpin
sales figures in  Europe ,” Bernhard Maier, Porsche’s sales
chief, said in the statement.  Deliveries of the 911 slumped 35 percent to 1,666 vehicles.
Demand for the Boxster roadster and the hard-top Cayman version
fell 23 percent to 1,221 cars. The Cayenne, Porsche’s best-
selling model, jumped 16 percent to 5,483 SUVs. Deliveries of
the Panamera coupe rose 2.5 percent to 2,352.  To contact the reporter on this story:
