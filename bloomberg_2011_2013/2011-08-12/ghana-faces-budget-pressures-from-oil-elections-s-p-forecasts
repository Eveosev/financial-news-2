Ghana , Africa’s newest oil exporter,
faces budget pressure from spending prompted by elections and
crude sales and may run a deficit of as much as 7 percent of
gross domestic product this year,  Standard & Poor’s  said.  “They will benefit from the oil-related revenue, but we
still believe their fiscal expenditure pressures are
significant,” Christian Esters, a Frankfurt-based credit
analyst at S&P, said in a phone interview yesterday.  Ghana raised its budget deficit target to 5.1 percent of
GDP for 2011 from 4.1 percent, Finance Minister  Kwabena Duffuor 
said last month. The fiscal gap will narrow from 6.5 percent of
GDP in 2010 as oil earnings boost revenue. Ghana’s economy will
grow 14.4 percent this year, the fastest in  Africa , and the
revised budget boosts government spending on roads, schools and
agricultural production by 1.5 billion cedis ($989 million),
Duffuor said.  “The expectations from the oil revenue are fairly high and
have created spending demands,” Esters said. “Ghana has also
implemented wage increases for their public sector employees
which will also weigh on the fiscal performance.”  London-based Tullow Oil Plc operates Ghana’s Jubilee oil
field, West Africa’s biggest discovery of crude from an offshore
field in a decade. Daily output from the field is expected to
climb to 120,000 barrels per day by August or September from
80,000 barrels now, according to Tullow.  Presidential Elections  Incumbent President John Evans Atta Mills faces elections
next year after winning 96.9 percent of the nation’s ruling
National Democratic Congress party vote last month. Mills will
face Nana Akufo-Addo of the opposition New Patriotic Party in
the election after beating him 50.23 percent to 49.77 percent in
a run-off vote in December 2008.  “They are going to have presidential elections in 2012
which in the run up may lead to some fiscal slippage,” Esters
said.  Ghana’s first-quarter government wage bill rose 24 percent
to 869.6 million cedis after a new payment policy was
implemented for state workers, the  Bank of Ghana  said June 1.  The $750 million of 8.5 percent Eurobonds due 2017 of
Africa’s second-biggest cocoa and gold producer was little
changed at 110.81 cents on the dollar, heading for a 1.7 percent
weekly drop, the biggest five-day decline since January, as of
4:46 p.m. in London. The yield was 6.342 percent, according to
prices compiled by Bloomberg.  “Their level of fiscal debt is high, we expect Ghana’s
general government debt to come to 44 percent of GDP at the
year-end of 2011,” Esters said.  The West African nation, which began production of crude
for export in December, was downgraded by S&P to B, five steps
below investment grade, with a “stable” outlook on Aug. 27,
2010. The rating service said the government’s then fiscal
deficit target of 2.1 percent in 2011 and 1.6 percent in 2012
was “unrealistic.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
