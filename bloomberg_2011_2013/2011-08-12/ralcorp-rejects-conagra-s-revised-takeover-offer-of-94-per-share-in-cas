Ralcorp Holdings Inc. (RAH) , the maker of
Raisin Bran cereals, rejected a revised $94 a share cash
takeover offer from ConAgra Foods.  Ralcorp said the proposal was unanimously rejected by its
board of directors, saying the offer “is not in the best
interests” of the company and shareholders.  ConAgra first offered to buy Ralcorp in March for $82 a
share. The offer was revised to $86 in May. Last month, Ralcorp
decided to spin off Post Foods.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
