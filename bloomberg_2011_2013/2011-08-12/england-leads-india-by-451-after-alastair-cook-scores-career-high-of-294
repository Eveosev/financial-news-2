Alastair Cook  scored a career-high
294 as England was 710-7 declared in the third cricket Test
against  India  at Edgbaston in Birmingham.  Cook’s total was the third-highest by an England batsman
and the most since Graham Gooch’s 333 against India in 1990.
India was 35-1 at the close of play to trail by 451 runs as
Virender Sehwag was dismissed on the first ball he faced for the
second consecutive innings.  England’s run total is its most since scoring 903-7
declared against Australia in 1938.  England won the first two Tests in the four-match series.
It can replace India as No. 1 in the International Cricket
Council rankings with another victory or by drawing the final
two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
