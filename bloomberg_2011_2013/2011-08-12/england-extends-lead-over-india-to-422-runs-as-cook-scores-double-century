Alastair Cook â€™s career-best 266 not
out helped England extend its lead to 422 runs over India at tea
on day three of their third cricket Test.  Cook eclipsed his previous high score of 235, set in
November in Australia, as England reached 646-6 at Edgbaston in
Birmingham. Eoin Morgan scored 104 before being caught by
 Virender Sehwag  from Suresh Raina. India was bowled out for 224
in its first innings.  England won the first two Tests in the four-match series.
It can replace India as No. 1 in the International Cricket
Council rankings with another victory or by drawing the final
two matches.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
