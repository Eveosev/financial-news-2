Peruvian benchmark bonds gained,
sending yields to a six-month low, as the faltering global
recovery led traders to bet the nation’s central bank may wait
until next year to raise  interest rates .  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 7.84 percent sol-
denominated bond due August 2020 fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, to 6.02 percent at 3:54 p.m. New York time.
That was the lowest level since Feb. 11, according to prices
compiled by Bloomberg. The bond’s price rose 0.37 centimo to
112.51 centimos per sol. The price has risen 0.84 centimo this
week, the most since the period ending May 6.  The central bank kept its benchmark rate at 4.25 percent
for a third straight month at a policy meeting yesterday, citing
“weakness” in the global economy and signs of slower domestic
growth.  Standard & Poor’s  unprecedented downgrade of the U.S.’s
top credit rating is fueling “uncertainty” about the world
economy, the central bank said.  “Although  Peru  showed itself to be prepared during the
2008 crisis, this time it’s a bit more complicated,” said
Manuel Aldave, head of investments at Banco Internacional del
Peru. “If global conditions stay like this and August inflation
isn’t very high or comes in below market expectations, the rate
could remain at 4.25 until the end of the year. I don’t see the
central bank being very aggressive.”  After accelerating 0.79 percent in July, the most in three
years, monthly inflation will likely be slower than 0.25 percent
through the end of the year, Adrian Armas, the central bank’s
research director, told reporters in a conference call from  Lima 
today.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7430 per  U.S. dollar ,
from 2.7445 yesterday.  To contact the reporter on this story:
