ConocoPhillips bought a cargo of
diesel in northwest  Europe  from Morgan Stanley. Barges of the
ultra-low-sulfur grade traded at a cheaper price than yesterday.  Gasoil gained on London’s ICE Futures Europe exchange as
Brent advanced. Gasoline barges for immediate loading rose as
stockpiles fell for a fourth week.  Light Products  Eurobob gasoline for loading in Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp
traded from $967 to $980 a metric ton, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Argus Bulletin Board. That
compares with deals yesterday from $946 to $965.  Vitol Group bought 4,000 tons of the 7,000 tons that
changed hands. Ethanol is added to Eurobob to make finished
motor fuel. The trades are typically for 1,000 or 2,000 tons.  Gasoline inventories in independent storage in the ARA-area
dropped 10 percent to 554,000 tons in the week to yesterday on
exports to  Canada ,  Nigeria , the U.K. and the U.S., according to
PJK International BV, a researcher based in the Netherlands.
That’s the lowest level since Dec. 30.  The fuel’s crack shrank to $6.38 a barrel from $6.45
yesterday, according to PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a crude and
refined products broker in London.  Naphtha’s discount to Brent shrank to $4.96 a barrel from
$5.11 yesterday, according to PVM. That’s the lowest spread
since May 27.  Middle Distillates  ConocoPhillips bought the diesel cargo at a premium of $34
a ton to September gasoil, priced for delivery to Bremen in
 Germany  from Aug. 27 to Aug. 31, according to a survey of
traders and brokers monitoring the Platts pricing window which
ends at 4:30 p.m. in  London . Vitol also bought a cargo from
Royal Dutch Shell Plc at a $40 premium, priced for delivery to
the Turkish port of Aliaga, the survey showed.  Diesel barges traded three times at a premium of $26 and
once at $27.50 a ton to September gasoil, according to the
survey. That’s lower than yesterday’s deals at $28 more than the
gasoil contract.  Gasoil for September advanced 3.5 percent to $918.25 a ton
as of 5:03 p.m. London time on the ICE exchange. Brent for the
same month rose 0.4 percent to $108.50 a barrel.  The fuel’s crack, a measure of refining profitability, was
little changed at $14.84 a barrel at 4:30 p.m. London time
yesterday, according to ICE data.  Jet fuel traded at $71 and $72 a ton more than September
gasoil, the survey showed. That compares with Aug. 10 trades at
a premium of $71. A deal was also done today at $985 a ton.  Residues  High-sulfur fuel oil barges rose, trading from $602.50 to
$603.75 a ton, according to the Platts survey. That compares
with deals yesterday from $595 to $596.50. Low-sulfur grade
traded at $632.25 a ton, higher than the $629 done yesterday,
the survey showed.  Refiners  U.S. refiners may start exporting more fuels as refinery
processing rates rose to close to the highest level in a year,
at 90 percent of capacity, “much to the woe of European and
Asian refiners,” according to JBC Energy GmbH.  Zambia’s only oil refinery will shut for maintenance from
Oct. 1 to Nov. 10, October, the Times of Zambia reported today
citing Teddy Kasonso, permanent secretary in the Ministry of
Energy and Water Development.  The government will increase imports of gasoline and diesel
before the shutdown to avert shortages, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
