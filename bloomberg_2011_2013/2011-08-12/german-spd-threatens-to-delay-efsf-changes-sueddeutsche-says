Lawmakers from  Germany ’s main
opposition party threatened to withhold parliamentary approval
for an overhaul of  Europe ’s rescue fund until they’re presented
with more information about the size of guarantees Germany has
to provide, the  Sueddeutsche Zeitung  reported.  An agreement of European leaders on revamping the European
Financial Stability Facility is “too vague and abstract” and
plans to pass the changes by the end of September are “very
ambitious,” Carsten Schneider, the Social Democratic Party’s
budget spokesman, told the newspaper.  If the government provides “timely and sufficient
information” about the burden the EFSF changes will add to the
budget, the party is willing to enter into negotiations about
giving their support, Joachim Poss, SPD deputy caucus chairman,
was quoted as saying.  The SPD has signaled it backs the plan to empower the 440
billion-euro ($624 billion) EFSF to buy bonds in the secondary
market, grant precautionary credits and recapitalize banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
