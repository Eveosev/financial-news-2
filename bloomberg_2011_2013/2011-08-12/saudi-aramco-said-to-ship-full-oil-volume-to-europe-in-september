Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, will supply full contractual volumes of
oil to customers in Europe in September, according to two
refinery officials.  Saudi Aramco , as the company is known, will provide 100
percent of cargoes of crude sold under long-term contracts, said
the officials, who declined to be identified because the
agreements are confidential.  Saudi Arabia exported 790,000 barrels a day of Arab Light
and Extra Light crude and 20,000 barrels a day of Arab Medium to
the 24 European members of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in May, the  International Energy
Agency  said Aug. 10. It didn’t ship any Arab Heavy to Europe,
the IEA said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
