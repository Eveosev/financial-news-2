Clover Industries Ltd. (CLR) , a South
African food producer, will import 4 million liters of ultra-
heat treated milk from Uruguay to ensure supply while it moves
its long-life milk facilities to KwaZulu-Natal and  Port
Elizabeth ,  Business Report  said.  The relocation will take place in so-called low milk-flow
seasons over the next two to three years, the Johannesburg-based
newspaper cited Clover Deputy Chief Executive Officer Manie
Roode as saying.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
