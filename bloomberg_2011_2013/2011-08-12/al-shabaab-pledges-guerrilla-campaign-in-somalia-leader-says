A leader of al-Shabaab, the group of
Somali militants the pledge allegiance to al-Qaeda, said it will
wage a “guerrilla” campaign against African Union peacekeepers
following the militants’ withdrawal from Mogadishu.  “Now we can practice guerrilla war,” said Sheikh Hassan Dahir Aweys on Radio Kulmiye, a broadcaster based in the city.
“We adjust our tactics.”  Al-Shabaab, which has waged a four-year campaign to remove
the Western-backed government of President Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed, withdrew its forces from the Somali capital, Mogadishu,
on Aug. 6. The government said the move was a “tremendous step
forward for the nation,” according to an Aug. 9 statement.  Aweys said today there has been infighting among the
leaders of al-Shabaab since the withdrawal. Strategic
Forecasting Inc. said in an e-mailed note yesterday the
militants may have appointed a new leader.  Last month, the  United Nations  declared a famine in five
southern regions of Somalia, including Mogadishu, amid the worst
drought in the region in 60 years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
