Heat will extend from coast to coast
next week with the highest temperatures in the south-central
U.S. and the northern Rocky Mountains, said  Matt Rogers ,
president of Commodity Weather Group LLC.  The U.S. Northeast may remain seasonable during same time
frame, Aug. 17 to Aug. 21, according to Rogers’ 6- to 10-day
forecast.  Hot weather is expected to move into the Northeast
beginning Aug. 22 and lasting through Aug. 26, according to
Rogers’ 11- to 15-day forecast.  During that period, Oklahoma and parts of  Texas , as well as
Idaho and parts of Nevada, Utah and Oregon, may experience an
intense outbreak of heat.  “Texas stays hot,” Rogers, based in Bethesda, Maryland,
said in a note to clients today.  Natural gas traders monitor  weather forecasts  to determine
if temperatures may boost heating or cooling needs.  Yesterday, the high temperature at  Dallas  Fort Worth
International Airport hit 97 degrees Fahrenheit (36 Celsius),
ending a 40-day streak of 100 degrees or higher, according to
the  National Weather Service . In 1980, the temperature hit 100

degrees today and climb back into the 100s early next week, the
