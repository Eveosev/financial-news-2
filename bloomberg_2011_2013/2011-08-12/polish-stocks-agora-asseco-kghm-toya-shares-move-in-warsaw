Poland ’s WIG20 Index rose 38.15, or
1.7 percent, to close at 2,331.53, gaining for a second day and
trimming this week’s decline to 4.7 percent.  The following are among the most active stocks on the
 Warsaw Stock Exchange  today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Agora SA (AGO)  , Poland’s largest publisher, jumped 1.5
zloty, or 12 percent, to 13.75 zloty. First-half net income was
27.8 million zloty ($9.5 million), beating the 17.1 million-
zloty mean estimate of six analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  Asseco Poland SA (ACP)   rose for the first time in eight
days, increasing 2.32 zloty, or 6.2 percent, to 39.47 zloty
after central  Europe ’s largest software developer proposed
buying back as much as 600 million zloty of shares.  PGE SA (PGE PW), Poland’s biggest power producer, climbed
0.25 zloty, or 1.3 percent, to 19.5 zloty, extending yesterday’s
8.5 percent advance.  Tauron Polska Energia SA (TPE)  , the
second-largest utility, increased 0.6 percent to 5.32 zloty. ING
Groep NV raised its recommendation for central European power
utilities to “overweight” from “neutral,” saying the
industry has strong finances and has become more attractive
after recent declines.  Toya SA (TOAA PW) slumped 0.04 zloty, or 1.4 percent, to
2.76 zloty as the Polish manufacturer of power tools started
trading in Warsaw. The company sold 25.9 million zloty of shares
at 2.8 zloty each in an initial public offering last month,
according to a Warsaw bourse e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
