Heating oil gained, following crude
higher after a report that U.S. retail sales increased in July
by the most in four months, boosting confidence in the economic
recovery.  Futures rose as much as 1.3 percent as the Commerce
Department reported that retail sales advanced 0.5 percent.
Excluding automobiles and service stations, sales climbed 0.3
percent. This follows a report yesterday that jobless claims
sank to a four-month low.  “While things might not look like the recovery is
advancing rapidly, the world isn’t going to come to a halt,”
said  Gene McGillian , an analyst and broker at Tradition Energy
in Stamford,  Connecticut . “Some of the panic seems to have
slipped away.”  Heating oil for September delivery gained 0.65 cent to
$2.9057 a gallon at 11:20 a.m. on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . It was the third straight increase. Prices were
heading for a weekly loss of 1.2 percent.  Crude oil for September slipped 1 cent to $85.71 a barrel.  Futures pared gains as equities retreated after a report
that U.S. consumer confidence slid in August to the lowest level
since May 1980.  “A decline in the consumer confidence may translate into
lower  consumer spending  in the months ahead and dampen economic
growth and demand for petroleum products,” said  Andy Lipow ,
president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in Houston.  Consumer Confidence   The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment slumped to 54.9 from 63.7 the prior
month. The gauge was projected to decline to 62, according to
the median forecast in a Bloomberg News survey.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.4 percent as of
11:22 a.m. in  New York , after an earlier increase of 1.4
percent. The index has risen or fallen at least 4.4 percent the
previous four days.  “The oil market is tacking the equities price swings,”
McGillian said.  Gasoline for September delivery sank 0.79 cent, or 0.3
percent, to $2.8194 a gallon on the exchange, and headed for a
weekly gain of 0.5 percent.  Regular gasoline at the pump, averaged nationwide, fell 1.4
cents to $3.606 a gallon yesterday, according to AAA data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
