(Corrects name of analyst in sixth paragraph in story
first published on Aug. 12.)  Dangote Flour Mills Plc (DANGFLOU) , a Nigerian
flour milling company, said profit fell 51 percent during the 12
months through December.  Net income for the period declined to 2.72 billion naira
($17.7 million) from 5.56 billion naira a year earlier, the
company said in a statement published on the website of the
 Nigerian Stock Exchange  today. Revenue increased to 67.6 billion
naira from 61.4 billion naira.  Wheat prices were higher in the second half of last year
and resulted in the drop in profit, Securities Africa Trading
said in a note e-mailed to clients today. The prices increased
for the first two quarters of this year “so the margins and
numbers are going to get worse,” it said.  “The wheat price has subsequently eased somewhat so we
expect better numbers for the second half of this year,” the
statement said.  The company will pay a dividend of 20 kobo per share for
the period, Dangote Flour said.  “Dangote Flour is on offer with 6 million shares at 15.20
naira, as the market is likely unhappy with these numbers,”

Capital , wrote in an e-mailed note to clients today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
