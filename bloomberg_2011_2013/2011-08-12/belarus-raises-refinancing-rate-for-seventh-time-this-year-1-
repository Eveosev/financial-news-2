The Belarusian central bank raised
its refinancing rate for the seventh time this year to 22
percent to tame inflation, saying borrowing costs would remain
elevated until the former Soviet republic’s economy improved.  The Minsk-based Natsionalnyi Bank Respubliki Belarus
increased the rate by 2 percentage points, effective Aug. 17,
according to a statement on its  website  today.  “Along with general economic measures undertaken by the
government, this tightening will help stabilize the external
economic situation and limit inflation,” the bank said. “As
positive trends in the economy and financial markets develop,
the Natsionalnyi Bank will return to its policy of gradually
lowering the refinancing rate.”  Belarus is struggling to close a current-account deficit
that reached 16 percent of economic output in 2010 and has
sought bailout loans from  Russia  and the  International Monetary
Fund . Cumulative inflation rose to a 10-year high of 36.2
percent in the six months through June, the state-run news
service Belta reported July 14, citing the National Statistics
Committee.  Belarusian dollar-denominated debt due in January 2018
fell, pushing the yield up 50 basis points, or 0.5 percentage
point, to a record of 12.911.  To contact the reporter on this story:
