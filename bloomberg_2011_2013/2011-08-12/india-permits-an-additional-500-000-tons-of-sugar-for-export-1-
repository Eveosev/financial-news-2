India , the world’s second-biggest
sugar producer, said it would allow an additional 500,000 metric
tons of the sweetener to be exported as local supplies outstrip
demand.  The government permitted mills and traders to sell 24
percent more sugar overseas than was previously allowed, a
minister told reporters today on condition of anonymity.  India won’t allow further exports until Sept. 30, Food
Minister K.V. Thomas said today. Before today the sugar export
limit from Oct. 1 last year was 2.1 million tons, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
