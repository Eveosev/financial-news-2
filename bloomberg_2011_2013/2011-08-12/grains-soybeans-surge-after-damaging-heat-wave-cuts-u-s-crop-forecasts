Wheat futures declined, reversing
their advance, after the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  raised
its estimate on global supplies, boosted by higher-than-expected
output in  Europe  and Russia.  December-delivery wheat fell as much a 0.5 percent to
$7.295 a bushel in  Chicago  after rising 1.9 percent yesterday.
It traded at $7.3125 at 3:35 p.m. in Singapore time.  Global  production  will rise 3.7 percent to 672.09 million
metric tons in 2011-2012, more than the 662.4 million ton
estimate last month, the USDA said. Stockpiles will be 188.9
million tons, up from 182.2 million tons, it said.  “The world wheat projections were bearish,”  Luke Mathews ,
a commodity strategist at Commonwealth Bank of  Australia , wrote
in a report today. The global stocks-to-use ratio of 28 percent
is “comfortably” higher than the 2007-2008 level of about 20
percent, he said.  The wheat harvest in  Russia , which ended an export ban last
month, will total 56 million tons, bigger than the 53 million
tons estimated last month, the USDA said. Harvests in Europe
will reach 133.5 million tons, compared with 132.1 million tons
forecast last month, it said.  Corn for December delivery lost 0.5 percent to $7.105 a
bushel, after gaining as much as 0.8 percent to $7.20 a bushel,
the highest price for the most-active contract since June 9.  Corn Harvests  Global harvests of corn will total 860.5 million tons in
the 2011-2012 season, 11.9 million tons smaller than last
month’s estimate, the USDA said, as it pared its output forecast
for the U.S. by 4.1 percent. Demand was predicted to outpace
production by 8.4 million tons, bigger than the 5.2 million ton
deficit forecast by the agency in July, the USDA data showed.  Production in the U.S., which is estimated to grow 38
percent of the global corn harvest, will total 12.914 billion
bushels (328 million tons), compared with 13.47 billion
projected in July, the USDA said. The average prediction of 31
analysts in a Bloomberg survey was for 13.079 billion. Last
year’s crop was 12.447 billion bushels. Yields were cut to 153
bushels an acre, down from 158.7 in July.  “With weather disappointing during both the U.S. planting
and growing season, prices will need to rally further to adjust
demand down to the lower available supplies,” Damien Courvalin
and  Allison Nathan , analysts at Goldman Sachs Group said in a
report yesterday.  Soybeans for November delivery declined 0.4 percent to
$13.27 a bushel in Chicago after gaining 0.8 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
