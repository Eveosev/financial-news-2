European stocks climbed the most
since May 2010, extending the Stoxx  Europe  600 Index’s rally
from a two-year low, as France,  Spain ,  Italy  and  Belgium  imposed
short-selling bans.  A gauge of European banks increased 4.3 percent, for its
second day of gains, as  Dexia SA (DEXB)  surged 17 percent and  Barclays
Plc (BARC)  soared 5.3 percent.  Aker Solutions ASA (AKSO) ,  Norway ’s biggest
maker of oil rigs, declined 5.3 percent after reporting
quarterly earnings that missed the average analyst projection.  The Stoxx 600 jumped 3.7 percent to 237.49 at the 4:30 p.m.
close in  London  as more than 30 stocks rose for every one that
fell. Even so, the benchmark measure dropped 0.6 percent this
week. The gauge has decreased 18 percent from its high this year
on Feb. 17.  “The ban will cause a short-term rally,” said Manish Singh, head of investment at Crossbridge Capital in London,
which has about $2 billion under management. “The authorities
can ban short-selling, but they can’t ban the spate of bad news
on the economy from hitting the tape. A robust response that
addresses long-term structural concern is needed to restore
confidence to the markets.”  France, Spain, Italy and Belgium imposed bans on short-
selling from today to stabilize markets after Societe Generale
SA dropped to its lowest price since March 2009 on Aug. 10.  National benchmark indexes advanced in every western
European market. France’s  CAC 40 Index (CAC)  rose 4 percent. The
U.K.’s FTSE 100 Index gained 3 percent and  Germany ’s DAX Index
climbed 3.5 percent.  Short-Selling Ban  National regulators imposed the bans “to restrict the
benefits that can be achieved from spreading false rumors or to
achieve a regulatory level playing field,” the European
Securities and Markets Authority, which coordinates the work of
national regulators in the 27-nation European Union, said in a
 statement  after talks ended late yesterday.  The short-selling ban, “combined with the recent upward
momentum we’ve seen, could help ensure we see a slightly less
dramatic finish to the week,” said Cameron Peacock, a market
analyst at IG Markets in  Melbourne . “Although with traders
still jittery, any negative news could see people heading for
the exit once again.”  French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and German  Chancellor
Angela Merkel  will meet in Paris on Aug. 16 after concern that
the sovereign-debt crisis will spread to the region’s larger
economies rattled the French stock market.  France ’s gross domestic product was unchanged from the
first quarter, when it rose 0.9 percent, the Insee statistics
office said today in Paris. Economists had forecast a 0.3
percent gain, according to the median of 15 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey.  European Industrial Output  Industrial production in the euro area unexpectedly fell in
June, led by a drop in capital goods such as machinery, adding
to signs the economy is losing momentum as governments struggle
to contain the debt crisis.  Production slipped 0.7 percent from May, when it rose 0.2
percent, the European Union’s  statistics office  in Luxembourg
said. Economists had forecast that output to remain unchanged.  A report showed that U.S. retail sales gained 0.5 percent
in July, their biggest increase in four months. That matched the
median estimate of 81 economists surveyed by Bloomberg News.
scheduled for release at 9:55 a.m. New York time may show a drop  A separate report showed that U.S. consumer confidence fell
further than expected in August. The Thomson Reuters/University
of Michigan index of consumer sentiment declined to 54.9. That
missed the median estimate of 69 economists for a reading of 62.  Societe Generale (GLE)  jumped 5.7 percent to 24.30 euros in
Paris. Even so, France’s second-largest lender has retreated 11
percent this week.  Dexia, Barclays Advance  Dexia, Belgium’s largest bank by assets, surged 17 percent
to 1.80 euros, its biggest gain since March 2009.  KBC Groep NV (KBC) 
rose 9.6 percent to 20.90 euros.  UBS AG (UBSN) ,  Switzerland ’s biggest
bank, advanced 5.7 percent to 11.67 Swiss francs, while Barclays
jumped 5.3 percent to 187.2 pence.  Lloyds Banking Group Plc (LLOY) 
rallied 5 percent to 33.8 pence.  Banco Santander SA (SAN) , Spain’s
largest lender, climbed 6.6 percent to 6.40 euros.  Swiss insurers led a gauge of European insurance companies
higher, for one of the best industry performances in the Stoxx
600, a 4.5 percent rally.  Zurich Financial Services AG (ZURN) ,
Switzerland’s largest insurer, surged 7.1 percent to 171.50
Swiss francs and  Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  soared 7.4 percent to
98.90 francs.  CNP Assurances (CNP)  rose 8.2 percent to 12.30 euros,
while  Allianz SE (ALV) , Europe’s biggest insurer, climbed 5.3 percent
to 76.51 euros.  Aegon Shares Rally  Aegon NV, the Dutch owner of U.S. insurer Transamerica
Corp., rallied 8.8 percent to 3.11 euros. Moody’s Investors
Service raised its outlook for the company to “stable” from
“negative.”  SMA Solar Technology AG (S92)  rallied 18 percent to 73.10 euros
after the company confirmed its outlook for the second half,
saying it sees the conditions for a significant increase in
global demand.  The stock was raised to “buy” from “sell” by Alla Gorelova, an analyst at Wolfgang Steubing AG.  Meyer Burger Technology AG (MBTN) , the biggest maker of solar-
panel manufacturing equipment, surged 6.2 percent to 28.95
francs, while Renewable Energy Corp. ASA, the Norwegian maker of
solar-energy components, climbed 11 percent to 9.30 kroner.  Aker Solutions , Fugro  Aker Solutions slid 5.3 percent to 69 kroner after the
company reported second-quarter net income of 134 million kroner
($24 million), compared with 445 million kroner a year earlier,
missing analysts’ estimates of 389 million kroner.  Fugro NV (FUR) , the world’s biggest surveyor of deepwater  oil
fields , slumped 4 percent to 39.65 euros after posting first-
half net income of 100.4 million euros ($143 million). That
missed the average analyst estimate of 104 million euros.  Of the 276 companies in the Stoxx 600 that have reported
earnings since July 11, 47 percent have missed analysts’
estimates for per-share profit, while 44 percent have beaten
projections, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
valuation of Stoxx 600 companies as a multiple of their
estimated earnings has slipped to 9.7, near its lowest level
since March 2009.  To contact the reporter on this story:
