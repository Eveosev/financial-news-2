Coal India Ltd. (COAL) , the world’s largest
producer of the fuel, gained in Mumbai trading after posting
first-quarter profit that beat analyst estimates.  Coal India rose 1.8 percent to 392.15 rupees at 9:26 a.m.
local time. The stock, which was sold at 245 rupees apiece in an
initial public offering in November, gained 25 percent this
year, compared with a 17 percent drop in the benchmark Sensitive
Index. The Indian stock market was closed yesterday.  Net income rose 63 percent to 41.4 billion rupees ($915
million) in the three months ended June 30, the company said in
a stock exchange filing Aug. 12, after the markets closed. The
median estimate of 10 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg was a
profit of 36 billion rupees. Sales rose 27 percent to 145
billion rupees.  The state-run miner, based in Kolkata, increased prices as
environmental restrictions and approval delays curbed growth in
output of coal, used to fire more than half of  India ’s power
generation capacity. Utilities in the second-fastest growing
major economy are building plants to cut a peak-hour shortfall
that may reach 13 percent of demand this financial year.  Production in the quarter rose 1.2 percent to 96.3 million
metric tons, while sales climbed 5.1 percent to 106.3 million
tons, according to the filing. Coal India said it would add 62
billion rupees in revenue this financial year after increasing
prices in February.  Profit growth in the current quarter may be hurt by wage
increase provisions, Chairman N.C. Jha told reporters in Kolkata
Aug. 12. Coal India may conclude negotiations with unions on
wages in five to six months, he said.  The company, which accounts for more than 80 percent of
India’s coal output, expects profit to rise about 10 percent to
120 billion rupees if the sales target of 454 million tons for
this financial year is achieved, Jha said May 25.  The miner plans to boost production by 4.8 percent to 452
million tons this fiscal year, according to an agreement signed
with the government. Coal India produced 431.3 million tons of
coal in the year ended March 31, unchanged from a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
