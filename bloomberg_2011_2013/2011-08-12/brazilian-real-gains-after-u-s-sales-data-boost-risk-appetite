Brazil ’s real gained after retail
sales in the U.S. climbed in July by the most in four months,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real strengthened 0.9 percent to 1.6117 per dollar at 5
p.m. New York time, from 1.6257 yesterday. It declined 2.2
percent this week amid a sell-off in global financial markets.  Retail sales in the world’s biggest economy rose 0.5
percent last month, following a 0.3 percent increase in June
that was larger than previously estimated. A stronger global
economy will bring more dollars to Brazil, driving up the real,
said Hideaki Iha, a currency trader at Fair Corretora de Cambio
e Valores.  As economic indicators improve, “lots of money will go
searching for returns,” Iha said in a telephone interview from
 Sao Paulo . “Brazil will be one of those targets.”  Yields on most Brazilian interest-rate futures contracts
fell after central bank President Alexandre Tombini said today
in Sao Paulo that Brazil’s monthly inflation in June and July
was equivalent to an annual pace of less than 2 percent. Tombini
repeated a pledge to slow annual inflation to the 4.5 percent
mid-point of the government’s target range by 2012 from 6.87
percent in July.  The yields on futures contracts due in January 2012 fell
three basis points to 12.26 percent, indicating traders are
wagering policy makers will cut the benchmark Selic rate from
12.5 percent this year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
