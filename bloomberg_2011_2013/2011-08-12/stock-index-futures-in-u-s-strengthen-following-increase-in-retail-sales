U.S. stock-index futures extended
gains, signaling benchmark indexes may trim a third straight
weekly drop, after government data showed retail sales climbed
in July by the most in four months.  Standard & Poor’s 500 Index futures expiring in September
added 0.7 percent to 1,176.9 at 8:33 a.m. in  New York  after
earlier falling as much as 1.9 percent. The benchmark gauge for
American equities jumped 4.6 percent yesterday, trimming this
week’s decline to 2.2 percent. Dow Jones Industrial Average
futures increased 83 points, or 0.8 percent, to 11,167 today.  The 0.5 percent increase in sales reported by the Commerce
Department matched the median forecast of 81 economists surveyed
by Bloomberg News and followed a 0.3 percent increase in June
that was larger than previously estimated. Excluding auto sales,
purchases rose more than projected.  The  S&P 500  is down 14 percent from a three-year high at
the end of April after plunging as much as 18 percent through
Aug. 8. About $2.3 trillion was erased from U.S. equity values
in the last three weeks as  Europe ’s debt crisis, signs the
economy is slowing and S&P’s downgrade of the government’s AAA
credit rating left the benchmark gauge for U.S. shares within 11
points of a  bear market .  Both European shares and the Russell 2000 Index of small
U.S. companies entered a bear market this week, falling at least
20 percent from their previous highs.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
