Bulgarian inflation was the slowest
in nine months in July as the domestic harvest pushed down food
costs.  Consumer prices rose 4.4 percent from a year earlier, after
a 4.8 percent increase in June, the National Statistics
Institute in the capital, Sofia, said today in a statement. The
median estimate of three economists surveyed by Bloomberg was
4.4 percent. Prices were unchanged in the month.  The  International Monetary Fund  cut its inflation forecasts
for  Bulgaria  on May 20 to an average of 4.2 percent this year
and 3 percent in 2012, from 4.8 percent and 3.7 percent
respectively. Food prices will fall in the second half of the
year, the IMF said. The government forecasts inflation at 3.6
percent in 2011.  To contact the reporter on this story:
