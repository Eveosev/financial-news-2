Romanian stocks soared the most in
almost 15 months as  Fitch Ratings  upgraded the city of
Bucharest’s foreign-currency ranking.  Romania ’s Bucharest Exchange Trading Index rose 4.6 percent
to 4,678.71 at the end of trading, the biggest daily surge since
May 26, 2010.  Fondul Proprietatea SA and  Banca Transilvania (TLV) , which
together comprise more than 42 percent of the 10-member index,
jumped 5.8 percent and almost 5 percent, respectively.  Fitch, a New York-based credit rating company, raised its
short-term foreign currency rating for the city of Bucharest to
F3 from B, while the long-term measure was increased to BBB-
from BB+ with a stable outlook.  “The ratings take into account the city’s improvement in
budgetary performance and its good track record of debt coverage
ratios,” Fitch said in a statement today. Bucharest’s debt is
“prudently managed,” the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
