Spring wheat yields in Manitoba and
Saskatchewan may improve as hot weather dried up flooded areas
and created “optimal crop-development conditions,” the
Canadian Wheat Board said in a report today.  Floods that delayed seeding of winter wheat were followed
by hot weather in July that dried flooded areas and provided sun
and warmth needed to promote crop growth, according to the
report. Spring wheat is now more developed than earlier
planted varieties, the wheat board said.  “The record-breaking heat wave that hit Manitoba and
eastern parts of Saskatchewan in July, created optimal crop
development conditions for most cereal grains,” Bruce Burnett,
director of weather and market analysis at the wheat board,
wrote in the report. “The areas originally washed out with
flood waters have now caught up, and in some cases surpassed the
early-sowed crops.”  Wheat futures for December delivery on the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange , where spring wheat is traded, gained 2 cents, or
0.2 percent, to $8.685 a bushel, at 11:36 a.m. London time.
Prices are up 4 percent this week.  The spring wheat harvest has started in some southern areas
of the provinces and is expected to accelerate in the next two
weeks, Burnett said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
