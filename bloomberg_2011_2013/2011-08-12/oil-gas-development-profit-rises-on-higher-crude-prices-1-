Oil & Gas Development Co.,
 Pakistan ’s biggest energy explorer, reported a 7.3 percent
increase in full-year profit after crude prices rose.  Net income in the 12 months ended June 30 climbed to 63.5
billion rupees ($735 million), or 14.77 rupees a share, from
59.2 billion rupees, or 13.76 rupees, a year earlier, the
Islamabad-based company said in a filing to the  Karachi Stock
Exchange  today. Sales rose 9.2 percent to 155.6 billion rupees.  The Islamabad-based company benefited from a 26 percent
increase in crude prices during the financial year as demand in
Pakistan surged to three times local supply. Pakistan imports 80
percent of its oil needs.  Oil & Gas Development’s average oil-selling price rose 17
percent from a year earlier to $72.05 a barrel, according to the
 filing . The selling price of natural gas rose 15 percent to
214.03 rupees per million cubic feet.  Oil & Gas Development, which has fallen 26 percent this
year, declined 0.5 percent to 127.24 rupees as of 12:14 p.m.
local time on the Karachi Stock Exchange. The company plans to
pay a cash dividend of 2.50 rupees a share, according to the
statement. Total dividend for the year was 5.50 rupees a share,
unchanged from a year earlier.  Gasoline prices in the country rose 13 percent in the
financial year, while gas climbed 9 percent, Karachi-based
