Copper rose for a second day in  New
York  as a jump in U.S. retail sales provided additional evidence
of sustained economic growth, tempering concern that the
recovery is faltering.  Retail sales in the U.S. climbed 0.5 percent in July, the
most in four months, showing consumers are holding up even as
employment slows. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index climbed as
much as 1.4 percent. Most raw materials rose. The U.S. is the
world’s second-largest copper user, after  China .  “Copper is acknowledging the fact that the economy is
slightly improving,” Phil Streible, a senior strategist at MF
Global Holdings Ltd., said in a telephone interview. “Copper
has strictly ignored its own fundamentals and has been 100
percent focused on macroeconomic data and the stock market in
the past week.”  Copper futures for September delivery rose 0.35 cent, or
0.1 percent, to close at $4.0335 a pound at 1:24 p.m. on the
Comex in New York. Yesterday, the price jumped 3 percent, the
most since March, after claims for unemployment-insurance
payments unexpectedly fell in the U.S. Still, the metal was down
2 percent for the week.  On the  London  Metal Exchange, copper for three-month
delivery fell $16, or 0.2 percent, to $8,865 a metric ton ($4.02
a pound), after gaining as much as 1.2 percent.  Copper futures have climbed 22 percent in the past year as
the world’s mining companies struggled to keep pace with rising
consumption. Falling ore grades, labor disputes and adverse
weather have cut output at mines owned by BHP Billiton Ltd. and
Rio Tinto Group, while demand from China is forecast to rebound
as consumers start to restock.  Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. predicted the
metal will rise to $11,000 on the LME in 12 months, citing
“supply disappointments.”  Tin rose 4.6 percent in London, the biggest gain since Aug.
26, 2010. Aluminum, lead, nickel and zinc dropped.  To contact the reporter on this story:
