Sterling Bank (STERLNBA)  Plc, a Nigerian
lender, rose the most in three weeks after Vanguard newspaper
reported it has agreed to buy privately held Equitorial Trust
Bank, a lender bailed out by the central bank in 2009.  The stock gained 7 kobo, or 4.9 percent, its biggest
increase since July 22, to 1.49 naira by 12:25 p.m. in Lagos,
reducing its loss this year to 36 percent.  Vanguard cited a statement from Sterling Bank regarding the
acquisition. The Central Bank of  Nigeria  has given the eight
lenders it bailed out in 2009 with 620 billion naira ($4
billion) until Sept. 30 to recapitalize or face liquidation or
nationalization. Nigeria on Aug. 5 nationalized three banks that
the central bank said were unlikely to meet the deadline.  To contact the reporter on this story:
