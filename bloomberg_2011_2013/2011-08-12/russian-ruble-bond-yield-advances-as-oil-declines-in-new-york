The yield on Russia’s 38 billion
rubles ($1.3 billion) of bonds due 2021 climbed for the first
day in three as oil, Russia’s chief export earner, headed for a
third weekly decline in  New York .  The yield on the ruble-denominated OFZ notes jumped 20
basis points, or 0.2 of a percentage point, to 8.07 percent as
of 12:21 p.m. in Moscow, the first rise in three days. OFZs due
2016 yielded three basis points less than yesterday at 7.73
percent.  Oil dropped in New York on concern volatility in global
financial markets will worsen an economic slowdown. Crude for
September delivery dropped 0.7 percent to $85.16 a barrel.  “Russian and Commonwealth of Independent States bonds are
under pressure amid high global volatility,” VTB Capital
analysts in Moscow wrote in an e-mailed research note. “This is
clearly not the best environment for the risk-on trade.”  The ruble was 0.2 percent stronger at 29.4175 per dollar,
bringing its total drop against the greenback this week to 3.7
percent. A close at that level would be the worst weekly drop
since July 2009.  Russia ’s currency was 0.5 percent stronger at 41.81 per
euro, leaving it up 0.4 percent at 34.9941 versus the central
bank’s target dollar-euro basket. Three-month implied volatility
in the ruble’s level against the dollar was little changed at 16
percent, after climbing 4.43 percentage points so far this week.  Non-deliverable forwards, which provide a guide to currency
movement trends and enable companies to hedge against them, show
the ruble at 29.7408 per dollar in three months, compared with
29.8580 yesterday.  Extra Yield  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian government
dollar debt rather than U.S. Treasuries rose four basis points
to 297, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global indexes.
The difference rose 17 basis points to 449 for Kazakhstan and
fell three basis points to 592 for Ukraine.  The cost of protecting Russian debt against non-payment for
five years using credit-default swaps rose one basis point to
220, according to data provider CMA, which is owned by CME Group
Inc. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  That’s the highest level since May 2010, based on closing
prices, the data show. The swaps have risen every day since July
28, the longest rising streak since at least October 2004, when
Bloomberg started tracking the data.  The contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for the
underlying securities or the cash equivalent should a government
or company fail to adhere to its debt agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
