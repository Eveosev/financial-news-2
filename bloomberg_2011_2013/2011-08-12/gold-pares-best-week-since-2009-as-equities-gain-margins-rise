Gold fell for the second straight
day as a jump in U.S. retail sales helped temper concern that
the recovery is faltering, eroding demand for the metal as a
haven.  Retail sales climbed 0.5 percent in July, the most in four
months, the government said today. Yesterday, a report showed
that applications for jobless benefits were the lowest since
early April. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index was up more than 5
percent in two days. Gold has advanced 23 percent this year amid
mounting sovereign debt in the U.S. and  Europe . Yesterday, the
metal reached a record $1,817.60 an ounce.  “The market is reacting to the reversal in risk trade,”
Tom Pawlicki, a Chicago-based analyst at MF Global Holdings
Ltd., said in a telephone interview. “People will want to wait
on the sidelines for the prices to come down further.”  Gold futures for December delivery fell $8.90, or 0.5
percent, to close at $1,742.60 at 1:45 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. This week, the metal jumped 5.5 percent, the most since
February 2009 and the sixth straight gain.  CME Group Inc. (CME) , owner of the world’s largest futures
market, raised  margins  on gold contracts by 22 percent as of the
close of business yesterday. The minimum amount of cash that
speculators must keep on deposit for an initial account
increased to $7,425 on a 100-ounce contract from $6,075.  Silver futures for September delivery rose 44.5 cents, or
1.2 percent, to $39.114 an ounce on the Comex. The metal, up 2.4
percent this week, has climbed 26 percent this year.  Platinum futures for October delivery rose $4.30, or 0.2
percent, to $1,796.70 an ounce on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange . This week, the price climbed 4.5 percent, the most
since December. The price gained for the fifth straight day, the
longest rally since March. The commodity has climbed 1 percent
in 2011.  Palladium for September delivery gained $14.40, or 2
percent, to $748.20 an ounce. The metal, up 0.9 percent this
week, has dropped 6.9 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
