Rossi Residencial SA (RSID3)  tumbled in  Sao
Paulo , leading a slump for Brazilian homebuilders that reported
declines in second-quarter earnings.  Rossi,  Brazil ’s sixth-biggest homebuilder by revenue, fell
7.1 percent to 10.55 reais at 3:53 p.m. New York time.  Cyrela
Brazil Realty SA Empreendimentos e Participacoes (CYRE3) , the second-
biggest, lost 6.6 percent to 13.70 reais while its next-largest
rival,  Gafisa SA (GFSA3) , slipped 6.1 percent to 6.90 reais.  Rossi’s net income fell 19 percent from a year earlier to
85 million reais, Cyrela’s dropped 43 percent to 95.9 million
reais and Gafisa’s plunged 74 percent to 25.1 million reais,
according to filings from the companies. That compares to
estimates by JPMorgan Chase & Co. for profits of 92 million
reais, 117 million reais and 50 million reais, respectively.  Adrian Huerta, an analyst at JPMorgan, called all three
results “weak” in notes to clients today.  “Cyrela remains our least preferred stock among the
Brazilian homebuilders despite recent underperformance,” Huerta
wrote in one of the reports.  Cyrela is down 9.7 percent this month, compared to a 7.3
percent drop for the  BM&FBovespa Real Estate (IMOBBV)  Index. Rossi has
lost 9.2 percent and Gafisa has fallen 8 percent.  Gafisa also cut its forecast for the margin on earnings
before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or
Ebitda, to a range of 16 percent to 20 percent, from 18 percent
to 22 percent previously, according to a regulatory filing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
