China ’s foreign trade faces a
complicated and unstable environment due to a slowing global
economic recovery, Li Rongcan, an assistant commerce minister,
said today at a forum in Beijing.  “The marked slowdown in the trend of global economic
recovery has directly restricted the growth of China’s external
demand,” according to a webcast of Li’s speech on sina.com. The
news website later removed the webcast.  The world’s biggest exporting nation faces the threat of
weakening overseas demand as Europe and the U.S. struggled to
rein in their debt burdens. China, which this week posted its
highest monthly  trade surplus  in more than two years, faces
challenges ahead in terms of trade, according to economists
including Societe Generale SA’s Yao Wei.  Li said today that Chinese exporters, especially small and
medium-sized companies, are facing an increasingly difficult
environment, according to the webcast.  --Victoria Ruan. Editor:  John Liu   To contact Bloomberg News staff on this story:
