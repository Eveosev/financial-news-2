The  European Investment Bank  and
 European Bank for Reconstruction and Development  will lend
Ukraine 400 million euros ($566 million) to upgrade hydropower
stations, the Energy and Coal Industry  Ministry  said.  An accord will probably be signed in September, the Kiev-
based ministry said late yesterday in an e-mailed statement.  Ukraine will use the funds to increase electricity
production by 213 gigawatts an hour at its six hydropower
stations from 2011 through 2016, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
