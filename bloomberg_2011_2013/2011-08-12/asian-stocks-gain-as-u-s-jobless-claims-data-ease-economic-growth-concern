Asian stocks fell, dragging the
benchmark index to its third straight weekly decline, amid
concern slowing global growth will hurt corporate earnings.  Hynix Semiconductor Inc. (000660)  retreated 9.6 percent in Seoul on
speculation memory-chip prices will decline. Sumitomo Rubber
Industries Ltd. and Sumitomo Realty & Development Co. sank more
than 3.6 percent in  Tokyo , where the government cut its economic
growth forecast.  Li & Fung Ltd. (494) , which supplies clothes and toys
to retailers, rose 7 percent in  Hong Kong  after profit beat
analysts’ estimates. News Corp. jumped 6.2 percent in Sydney on
brokerage upgrades.  About five stocks declined for every four that advanced in
the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, which lost 0.2 percent to 121.86 as
of 5:10 p.m. in Tokyo. The measure rose as much as 0.9 percent
earlier. The gauge has fallen 3.3 percent this week, set for its
third weekly drop, the longest stretch since June.  “Sentiment is still quite fragile, and we’re continuing to
see heightened volatility in markets,” said Im Jeong Jae, a
Seoul-based  fund manager  at Shinhan BNP Paribas Asset Management
Co., which oversees about $29 billion.  The MSCI gauge has tumbled 12 percent since July 26 as part
of a global rout that erased about $7 trillion in stock-market
value. Equities have slumped in that time amid disappointing
U.S. economic reports and an unprecedented downgrade in the
country’s debt rating by  Standard & Poor’s . MSCI’s Asia-Pacific
gauge is trading at 12.2 times estimated profit, the lowest
valuation since December 2008.  Jobless Claims  Australia ’s S&P/ASX 200 Index climbed 0.8 percent today,
while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index added 0.1 percent. The  Nikkei
225 (NKY)  Stock Average lost 0.2 percent in  Japan .  South Korea ’s Kospi
Index dropped 1.3 percent, while  Taiwan ’s Taiex Index lost 1.1
percent.  Futures on the S&P 500 Index slid 0.9 percent. The gauge
surged 4.6 percent yesterday, rebounding from the previous day’s
4.4 percent drop. Claims for U.S. unemployment benefits dropped
to the lowest level since April, a government report showed.
Stocks were also boosted by earnings at companies including
Cisco Systems Inc., the world’s largest maker percent of
networking equipment.  “The market had become pessimistic enough to start
becoming more responsive to upside surprises in terms of
economic data and earnings,” said Nader Naeimi, a Sydney-based
strategist for AMP Capital Investors Ltd., which manages almost
$100 billion. “There are still economic headwinds that haven’t
gone anywhere.”  Stalled Economy  The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan preliminary
index of consumer sentiment for August dropped to 62 from 63.7,
according to the median estimate of economists surveyed ahead of
a report due today.  France ’s statistics office reported today
that gross domestic product was unchanged from the first
quarter, when it rose 0.9 percent.  Technology shares were the biggest drags on MSCI’s Asian
index today. Hynix, the world’s second-largest computer-memory
chipmaker, tumbled 9.6 percent to 19,750 won after NH Investment
& Securities Co. said computer-memory chip prices are likely to
continue their drop in the third quarter.  Powerchip Technology Corp. fell 1.7 percent to NT$2.98 in
Taipei, while Nanya Technology Corp. slumped 5.1 percent to
NT$4.50.  “We may see additional drop in chip prices in the current
quarter amid still high inventories at PC makers while
chipmakers are boosting production,” Seo Won Seok, a Seoul-
based analyst at NH Investment & Securities Co., wrote in a
report dated yesterday.  Japanese Growth  Hanjin Shipping Co., South Korea’s largest shipping line,
sank 6.6 percent to 16,250 won after reporting a second-quarter
loss.  BlueScope Steel Ltd. (BSL)  plunged 7.7 percent to a record low
of 90.5 Australian cents after saying it will write down the
value of its assets by about A$900 million ($900 million).  Japanese stock gauges reversed earlier gains after the
government cut its forecast for economic growth this year to 0.5
percent from 1.5 percent as a record earthquake disrupted output
and depressed  consumer spending .  Sumitomo Rubber declined 5.3 percent to 893 yen, while
Sumitomo Realty sank 3.6 percent to 1,560 yen.  “Investors are losing confidence,”  Naoki Fujiwara , who
helps oversee $6 billion at Shinkin Asset Management Co. in
Tokyo. “The recovery is looking weak and investors are
concerned about the earnings outlook.”  Phone Hacking  Li & Fung climbed 7 percent to HK$12.84 in Hong Kong.
First-half net income of $236 million beat the $206 million
average analyst estimate in a Bloomberg survey.  News Corp. (NWS) , the media company involved in a phone-hacking
scandal, climbed 6.2 percent to A$15.66 in Sydney. Gabelli & Co.
raised its rating on the owner of Fox TV and the Wall Street
Journal to “buy” from “hold,” while Atlantic Securities
boosted the stock to “overweight” from “neutral.” The
company reported higher-than-estimated profit on Aug. 10.  Some 221 of 492 companies in MSCI’s Asia-Pacific index that
have reported quarterly net income since July 11 exceeded
analysts’ estimates, while 157 fell short, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  The Asian gauge lost 11 percent this year through
yesterday, compared with drops of 6.8 percent by the S&P 500 and
16 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
