Sterling Bank (STERLNBA)  Plc of Nigeria agreed
to acquire Equitorial Trust Bank Plc, a privately held lender
bailed out by the central bank in 2009.  The merger will lead to the recapitalization of Equitorial
Trust, Lagos-based Sterling Bank said in a statement published
today on the website of the  Nigerian Stock Exchange .  Equitorial Trust was one of eight banks bailed out in 2009
with an injection of 620 billion naira ($4 billion) following a
debt crisis that put the banking industry on the verge of
collapse. Regulators gave the lenders until Sept. 30 to
recapitalize.  Three of them, Afribank Plc, Bank PHB Plc and Spring Bank
Plc were nationalized by the government on Aug. 5 after they
were deemed unlikely to meet the recapitalization deadline.  Four others, Union Bank  Nigeria  Plc, Intercontinental Bank
Plc, Finbank Plc and Oceanic Bank International Plc, had earlier
signed agreements to be acquired by other lenders.  Sterling Bank rose 1.4 percent to 1.49 naira in Lagos,
paring its decline this year to 38 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
