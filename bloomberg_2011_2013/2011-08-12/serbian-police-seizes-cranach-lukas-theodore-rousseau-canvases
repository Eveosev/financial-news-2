Serbia’s special task force fighting
organized crime seized eight paintings, four of which are
suspected to have been stolen in  Switzerland  in 2008 and 2009
and sought by Interpol, the Interior Ministry said.  Two of the works were oil-on-canvas paintings of an unknown
17th-Century artist picturing Goddess Diana hunting, police
said. The others were an oil-on-wood painting of the Crucifixion
by Cranach Lukas and a still-life by Theodore Rousseau.  The value of the paintings is “unofficially estimated at
many million euros, with the Crucifixion alone worth more than 2
million euros ($2.85 million),” the Interior Ministry said in
an e-mail today.  Serbia has stepped up its fight against corruption and
organized crime to satisfy conditions for European Union
candidacy and win a date for entry talks by the end of 2011. The
police said they were working with Interpol to identify the
authors and owners of the remaining four paintings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
