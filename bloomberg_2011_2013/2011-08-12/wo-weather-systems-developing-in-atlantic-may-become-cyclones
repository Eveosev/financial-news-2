Two areas of disturbed weather off
West Africa have a 30 to 40 percent chance of becoming tropical
cyclones within two days, the Hurricane Center said.  Conditions may be more conducive to the development of both
systems over the next several days, the Miami-based center said
in a 2 a.m. New York-time  advisory .  One disturbance, 1,000 miles (1,600 kilometers) west of the
southern Cape Verde Islands, has a 30 percent chance of
developing into a tropical storm, while the other, 275 miles
south-southwest of that point, has a 40 percent chance, the
center said.  The systems may signal that the  Atlantic hurricane season 
is about to enter its most active phase. From about Aug. 20 to
Oct. 20 large storms typically develop in an area from the Cape
Verde Islands to the Leeward Islands known as the “main
development region.”  Storms that form in the area are often the largest and most
powerful of the Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from June
1 through Nov. 30.  To contact the reporter on this story:
