Cencosud SA,  Latin America ’s third-
largest retailer by sales, signed an agreement with Brazilian
lender Banco Bradesco SA to operate branded credit cards for
Cencosud’s supermarkets in  Brazil .  The Santiago, Chile-based shopping center, supermarkets,
department store and home improvement store operator will
receive a payment of as much as 200 million reais ($124 million)
from Bradesco as part of the deal, Cencosud said in an e-mailed
statement.  Cencosud expects to triple in the next years its credit
card operations in Brazil, where it already has more than 1.5
million cards, the statement said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
