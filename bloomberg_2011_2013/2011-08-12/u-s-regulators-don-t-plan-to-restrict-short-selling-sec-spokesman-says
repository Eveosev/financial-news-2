The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission doesn’t plan to take action to stem short sales after
four European countries banned the practice, a spokesman said.  “We do not intend to further restrict short sales, as the
commission already has in place restrictions on short selling
that are triggered when a stock is experiencing significant
downward price pressures,” SEC spokesman  John Nester  said in an
e-mailed statement today.  France, Spain, Italy and Belgium yesterday announced a ban
on short sales -- bets that a security will decline in value --
in a bid to stem a drop in financial stocks. The SEC prohibited
short sales for three weeks in September 2008 as the financial
crisis deepened.  Nester said that the commission also has rules in place
that restrict abusive short selling, including curbs on
“naked” sales and rules addressing failures to deliver by
trade settlement dates, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
