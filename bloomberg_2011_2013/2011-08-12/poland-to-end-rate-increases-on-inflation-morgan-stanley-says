Polish policy makers are likely to
give up further borrowing-cost increases after a report today
showed inflation unexpectedly slowed, Morgan Stanley said.  “There seems to be now only a remote chance of the
 National Bank of Poland  hiking again in this cycle, so we see
rates on hold at 4.5 percent,” Pasquale Diana, an economist
with Morgan Stanley in  London , wrote in a report today. The New
York-based bank’s earlier forecast was for the main rate to peak
at 5 percent, he wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
