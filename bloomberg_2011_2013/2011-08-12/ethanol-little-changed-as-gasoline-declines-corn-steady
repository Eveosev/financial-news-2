Ethanol futures were little changed
in  Chicago  as gasoline declined and as corn was steady after a
report forecast a smaller crop.  Futures rose 0.3 percent a day after the Agriculture
Department cut its corn crop estimate by 4.1 percent to 12.914
billion bushels from a July estimate of 13.47 billion in its
World Agriculture Supply and Demand Estimate. Separately,
gasoline dropped after Irving Oil Corp. started a catalytic
cracker at its New Brunswick refinery.  “When compared to the action generated by Thursday’s WASDE
report and the recent macro volatility, the ethanol market today
seemed unmotivated and lacking any external catalyst,” said
Michael Breitenbach, an analyst and trader at Blue Ocean
Brokerage LLC in New York.  Denatured ethanol for August delivery climbed 0.8 cent to
$2.785 a gallon on the Chicago Board of Trade. Futures rose 1.8
percent this week and are up 17 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol on the West Coast rose 5
cents, or 1.7 percent, to $2.975 a gallon and in  New York  the
additive lost 2.5 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $2.895, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in Chicago decreased 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to
$2.795 a gallon and in the U.S. Gulf the biofuel slipped 1 cent,
or 0.3 percent, to $2.915.  The fuel is made from corn in the U.S. and blended with
gasoline to stretch supply and meet federal mandates.  Gasoline for September delivery declined 0.51 cent to
settle at $2.8222 a gallon on the exchange, the first decline in
three days.  Corn futures for December delivery advanced 0.5 cent to
settle at $7.145 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least
2.75 gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
