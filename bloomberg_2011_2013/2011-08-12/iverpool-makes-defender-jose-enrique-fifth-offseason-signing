Liverpool signed Newcastle defender
 Jose Enrique , the 18-time English soccer champion said today on
its website.  Enrique, 25, had one year remaining on his contract with
Newcastle. He agreed to personal terms and passed a medical
examination to become Liverpool’s fifth signing of the off-
season.  “This is one of the happiest days of my life. I have come
to one of the biggest clubs not just in England, but in the
world. I am really, really happy,” he said in comments
published on the team’s  website . “They have won a lot of things
including the  Champions League . They have amazing players and I
hope to win things here.”  Neither club disclosed the transfer fee. Media reports in
the U.K. said Liverpool had paid around 6 million pounds ($9.8
million).  That figure would take the Reds’ expenditure during
the summer transfer period to about 50 million pounds.  The signing of Enrique follows the additions of  Jordan
Henderson ,  Charlie Adam ,  Stewart Downing  and reserve goalkeeper
Alexander Doni.  “I am excited by the new signings - it shows Liverpool’s
ambition,” Enrique said. “You can see they have big ambitions
and that’s why I came here - because I want to win things and I
think I can do that here.”  Liverpool opens the Premier League season tomorrow at home
against Sunderland.  To contact the reporter on this story:
