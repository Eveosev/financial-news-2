The European Commission is drafting
a plan to cap the subsidy for any single farmer at 300,000 euros
($425,000) a year from 2014, the Financial Times reported,
citing an unidentified commission official.  The plan, which should be completed next month, is likely
to encounter opposition from national governments such as that
of  France , which has resisted moves to change the European
Unionâ€™s common agricultural policy, the newspaper said.  One aim of the plan is to counter the perception that the
agricultural policy mainly benefits big agro-industrial
companies and rich landowners, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
