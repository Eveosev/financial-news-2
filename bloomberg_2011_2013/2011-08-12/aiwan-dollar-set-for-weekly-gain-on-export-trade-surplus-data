Taiwan ’s dollar rose, capping a
weekly gain, after an unexpected drop in U.S. jobless claims
bolstered confidence in the outlook for exports.  Government
bonds  declined.  Overseas sales rose 17.6 percent last month from a year
earlier, after increasing 10.8 percent the prior month, and the
island’s trade surplus widened to $3.34 billion from $1.38
billion, data showed this week.  “Data out of the U.S. and the European Union seem to be
generally mixed to positive,” supporting Asian currencies, said
Wai Ho Leong, a senior regional economist at  Barclays Capital  in
Singapore.  Taiwan’s dollar appreciated 0.2 percent to close at
NT$29.01 against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex
Inc. It reached NT$29.128 yesterday, the weakest level since
April 19, and rose 0.1 percent this week.  Unemployment-benefit claims in the U.S. fell by 7,000 in
the week ended Aug. 6 to 395,000, the Labor Department said
yesterday. The  European Central Bank  began buying Italian debt
on Aug. 8 after the government pledged deficit cuts, helping
trim the 10-year bond yield on that nation by 104 basis points
in four days.  “The sustained move lower in EU bond yields is giving some
encouragement to the market,” Leong said.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.375 percent notes due March 2021
rose three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 1.38
percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market show. The rate
dropped two basis points this week.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.385 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
