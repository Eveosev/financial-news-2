The Hungarian government expects to
spend as much as 45 billion forint ($234 million) on a mortgage
relief plan that runs through 2014, according to a government
report.  The government expects to spend 20 billion forint on the
program in 2012 alone, according to a report on the  website  of
the  Economy Ministry .  The government agreed with banks on a series of measures to
help borrowers with foreign currencies mortgages as the
weakening of the forint, especially against the Swiss franc,
boosted repayment obligations.  The government plans to spend 20.5 billion forint until the
end of 2014 on the purchase of properties of debtors who canâ€™t
service their debt obligations while the total cost of building
social homes should amount to 15 billion forint, the document
showed.  The Cabinet expects to spend 5 billion forint on a state
guarantee offered to banks while the maximum expenditure on an
interest rate subsidy plan is capped at 6 billion forint,
according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
