Serbia’s foreign-exchange reserves
rose to 10.38 billion euros ($14.78 billion) at the end of July,
aided by state borrowing in euros and new credit inflows.  Foreign-exchange reserves rose a net 417.2 million euros,
following the government’s borrowing worth 138.4 million euros,
new credit inflows worth 127.5 million euros and banks adding
51.9 million euros to their mandatory reserves accounts kept
with the central bank, the Belgrade-based National Bank of
Serbia said in an e-mail today.  On the spending side, the Balkan nation repaid 20.8 million
euros to locals whose savings were frozen in the early 1990s and
which the government pays through a so-called savings bond, on
top of 19.8 million euros paid to foreign creditors.  Net reserves, excluding the funds commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the  International Monetary
Fund , expanded to 5.75 billion euros from 5.4 billion euros in
June, the  Narodna Banka Srbije  said.  That level of the reserves matched 417 percent of M1 money
supply, seven months of goods and services imports and 1,075
percent of short-term debt, it said.  Interbank trading volumes rose in July to 2.45 billion
euros, increasing 390 million euros from June, while January
through July interbank trading volumes hit 10.5 billion euros,
it said.  The dinar gained a nominal 0.3 percent against the euro in
July and 3.3 percent in the first seven months of the year,
according to the bank, which sold 20 million euros last month to
stem excessive daily swings in the dinar exchange rate.  To contact the reporter on this story:
