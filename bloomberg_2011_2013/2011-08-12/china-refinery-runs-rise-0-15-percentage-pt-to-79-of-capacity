China ’s biggest oil refineries
increased their processing rate from two weeks earlier, industry
portal Oilchem.net reported.  The utilization rate climbed 0.15 percentage point to 79.24
percent, Shandong-based Oilchem reported on its  website , citing
a fortnightly survey of 23 major refineries with a total
capacity of about 5.6 million barrels a day.  Refinery utilization fell from a record 88.6 percent in May
after plants were closed for seasonal maintenance starting June.
The country may shut 707,800 barrels a day of capacity in the
third quarter for maintenance, according to PetroChina Co., the
nation’s largest oil company.  PetroChina closed a 200,000 barrel-a-day crude distillation
unit at Dushanzi plant on Aug. 9, according to today’s report.  Refineries in the eastern part of the nation were running
at 86 percent of capacity in the two weeks ended yesterday.
Plants in the south were at 90 percent, while those in the
northeast were at 64 percent. Refineries in the northwest were
operating at 48 percent and those in the north were at 85
percent, according to Oilchem.  To contact the reporter on this story:
