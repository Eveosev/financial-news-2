Wheat rose, heading for the first
four-day rally since January, on signs of lower-than-expected
spring-wheat output in the U.S., and as farmers use more of the
grain in livestock feed.  Production of the spring crop may total 522 million
bushels, down from 550.7 million estimated in July and 616
million last year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said
yesterday in a report. The USDA also cut its corn-output
forecast, boosting prospects that livestock-feed supplies will
tighten.  “The first yields out of the spring-wheat fields are a
little disappointing,” and may be lower than the USDA
predicted, Jerod Leman, a broker at Wellington Commodities in
Carmel,  Indiana , said in a telephone interview. “Right now,
there’s a lot of feeding in wheat going on.”  Wheat futures for December delivery rose 9 cents, or 1.2
percent, to $7.42 a bushel at 11:34 a.m. on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Before today, the price gained 1.1 percent in the past
year, while corn surged 74 percent.  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  gained for a second day
for the first time since July 7, after the government said U.S.
retail sales rose in July by the most in four months.  “People watch the financial markets closely, so they can
have a huge impact, near term,” on wheat prices, Leman said.  The U.S. is the world’s biggest wheat exporter. The grain
is the nation’s fourth-largest crop, valued at $13 billion in
2010, behind corn, soybeans and hay, government data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
