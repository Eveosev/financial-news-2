Banco Itau BBA, the wholesale arm of
Itau Unibanco Holding SA, said it obtained a $630 million loan
for working capital from a group of 19 banks, more than the $500
million originally proposed.  The three-year loan is part in euros and part in dollars,
according to a bank statement today. Itau will pay a spread of
120 basis points, or 1.2 percentage point, over the London
interbank offer rate on the $494 million dollar portion. The 97
million euro tranche pays 105 basis points over the euribor.  Itau,  Latin America ’s largest bank by market value, is
borrowing at the same rate as it did in October 2010 even after
the debt crisis in  Europe  and the U.S. caused yields on emerging
market debt to rise.  “The completion of this loan at this moment in the market
reaffirms the trust of international banks in Itau Unibanco,”
said Daniel Gleizer, Itau BBA’s executive vice-president for
institutional treasury, in a statement.  BNP Paribas SA, HSBC Holdings PLC and Mizuho Financial
Group Inc. led the transaction. Of the 19 banks that
participated, 11 are from Asia, according to Itau. Bank of
America Corp., Bank of Montreal, Royal Bank of Scotland Group
PLC and Unicredit SpA also participated. The leading banks and
Itau marketed the deal in  Hong Kong , Taipei and  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
