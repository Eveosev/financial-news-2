Ghana’s cedi weakened for a fourth
day and headed for its third straight weekly decline as traders
and manufacturers demanded dollars for their operations,
according Standard Chartered Bank Ghana Ltd.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
weakened as much as 0.6 percent to 1.5445 per dollar, the lowest
since Feb. 4, and traded at 1.5398 per dollar by 2:30 p.m. in
Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “Today the demand pressure was from traders and
manufacturers,” Othniel Kwainoe, a currency trader at the local
unit of Standard Chartered Bank Plc said by phone. Traders
sought the U.S. currency to import goods for resale while
manufacturers bought the dollar to import raw material, Kwainoe
said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
