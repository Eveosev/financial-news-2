Finning International Inc. (FTT) , the
world’s largest  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  equipment dealer, is in talks
to buy certain distribution assets that the manufacturer is
looking to shed after an acquisition last month.  Finning has entered into preliminary discussions with
Caterpillar about the purchase, the Vancouver-based company said
in a statement today.  Caterpillar, the world’s largest maker of construction and
mining equipment, July 8 closed its $8.8 billion purchase of
Bucyrus International Inc. and said it planned to sell the
company’s distribution assets to dealers with mining in their
territories.  The sale of the unit is part of the integration of Bucyrus.
Caterpillar, based in Peoria,  Illinois , generally uses dealers
to sell its products and provide services to customers, while
Bucyrus did so predominantly without using a third party.  Finning today said second-quarter earnings per share more
than doubled to 48 cents partly on rising demand for mining
equipment in countries such as  Chile .  The shares rose 49 cents, or 1.9 percent, to C$25.89 on the
Toronto Stock Exchange at 10:29 a.m. Earlier the price rose as
much as 5.3 percent, the biggest intraday rise since Aug. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
