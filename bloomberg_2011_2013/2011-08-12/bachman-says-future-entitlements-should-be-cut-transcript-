(Corrects spelling of Bachmann in headline.)  Representative  Michele Bachmann , a
Republican from  Minnesota  seeking her party’s 2012 presidential
nomination, said benefits for federal entitlement programs must
be cut to help balance the budget, while assuring current
beneficiaries that they wouldn’t be affected. She spoke during
an interview on Bloomberg Television’s “Political Capital with
 Al Hunt ,” airing this weekend.  (This is not a legal transcript. Bloomberg LP cannot
guarantee its accuracy.)  AL HUNT: We begin the program with Congresswoman Michele
Bachmann. Congresswoman, thank you for being with us.  REP. MICHELE BACHMANN: Al, thank you.  HUNT: Nice to see you.  BACHMANN: Good to be with you today.  HUNT: Tough debate Thursday night, but the real big deal is the
straw poll on Saturday. Are you going to win?  BACHMANN: Well, we hope to. We’ve been working very hard.  HUNT: Do you expect to?  BACHMANN: Well, we’re a little bit of an underdog, because I’ve
only announced for the presidency less than two month ago. So we
haven’t been here in the state working more than six, seven
weeks. And so we’re working very hard, very pleased with the
response that we’re seeing, and we’re hopeful.  HUNT: Let me ask you this. One person who won’t be in the straw
poll and wasn’t in the debate is Governor  Rick Perry . Now,
you’ve heard this before. You’re both strong Christian
conservatives, small-government economic types. The difference,
his backers say, is he’s created jobs as a governor for 11
years.  What does Michele Bachmann have that Rick Perry does not
have?  BACHMANN: Well, I’ll tell you what I have. I have a doctorate
and a post-doctorate degree in United States federal tax law.
And I’ve spent my entire practice in the United States federal
tax court seeing up close and personal how devastating high
taxes are on businesses and farmers and families.  HUNT: But wouldn’t you say he agrees with you on that?  BACHMANN: He may. I’ve got the background on tax law and on the
economy. I also am a job-creator. My husband and I started our
own company. We have a successful small business that we’ve
started from scratch. We figured out how to amass capital and
how to create two locations in our business and how to employ
people.  HUNT: So in jobs -  BACHMANN: That’s a strong skill, to know how to run a profit.  HUNT: On jobs creation, your record is - is more qualified than
his?  BACHMANN: Well, I - we - we have created jobs. We’ve signed both
sides of a paycheck. I get it.  HUNT: I think you’re saying he hasn’t in the private sector?  BACHMANN: I’m saying that I have in the private sector, but -but
I think more important than anything, what we need in a
president, we need someone who’s right on the issues, but we
also need someone who has a proven record of fighting - even in
the midst of adversity - on what we hope to accomplish, which is
turning the economy around and  job creation .  I’ve done that. I’ve been in  Washington  almost five years, and
I’ve been on the tip of the spear and on the cusp of almost
every big battle that’s come down that’s pro-free market.  HUNT: Including, most recently, the debt ceiling battle. And you
said that the  Standard & Poor’s  downgrade proved that you were
right. The S&P report also said there should be some balanced
package of sharp spending cuts and revenue increases to rectify
the  credit rating . Is S&P wrong on that?  BACHMANN: I think they are. I disagree with the fact that we
should be raising taxes. Clearly, we need to be able to have
revenue, but the way that you can have revenue is have a pro-
growth policy. We’re not seeing a pro-growth policy under
President Obama.  What we do need to do is dramatically shut down the level of
spending. We can’t accept the new normal in spending.  HUNT: You have said that you thought those federal bailout or
rescue efforts were wrong and they wouldn’t have happened under
a President Bachmann. Would we be better off today if Citicorp
and General Motors had gone bankrupt?  BACHMANN: I think that the bankruptcy procedure has worked very
well in this country for years. No one likes the idea of a large
corporation failing, but it happens, because there’s a reason
why those large corporations got themselves into a mess.
Citibank, for one, made some very unwise loans. When you look at
G.M., they made some very unwise union contract negotiation
deals. Why should the federal government come in and prop up
inefficient, burdensome deals that could never be met?  HUNT: So we would be better off - even though no one likes it,
we would be better off if they had met the market -  (CROSSTALK)  BACHMANN: I think the free - I’m an unashamed apologist for the
free market. I think if we would let the market work, I think we
would have had a better, more efficient economy. And certainly,
we wouldn’t have had the debt burden.  HUNT: You’ve called for dramatic tax cuts, even more than  Paul Ryan  called for, in the budget you voted for. Paul Ryan ends up
with a deficit in 10 years of $338 billion. You want a balanced
budget.  Tell us where you would cut. What - that goes beyond Paul Ryan,
Medicare, Social Security, health research?  BACHMANN: If I was president today, I’d call all the members of
Congress back into Washington. I would say, number one, we are
getting our AAA credit rating back, and this is how we’re going
to do it. We’re going to announce to the markets that we will,
under no circumstances, go into default. We will pay our
interest on the debt. And, number two, we will pay our military
salaries. And, number three, anyone who is currently a senior
citizen on entitlement benefits, they will receive them. We’ll
be crystal-clear.  But beyond that, we will reform the entitlement programs now,
not five years from now, not 26 years from now, now. Anyone who
is not yet on those programs, we’re going to change them.  HUNT: So if anyone’s 62 or 63, they would face Medicare cuts
now?  BACHMANN: There would be changes in the entitlement system. Now,
of course, we’d have to agree to them, but we all know what
needs to be done. Whether it’s longevity issues or means-
testing, that needs to be employed.  HUNT: But you would go beyond where Paul Ryan went on Medicare
and you would address Social Security cuts, too?  BACHMANN: For Social Security, again, I want to be crystal-
clear: Anyone who is currently a retiree would not be impacted.
But for people who are younger than that age, that needs to be
on the table. Everything needs to be on the table.  Because let’s face - face where we’re at - 43 cents out of every
dollar we spend is borrowed. We can’t go down this road anymore,
because, remember, this $2.4 trillion blank check we just gave
the president, in exchange for $21 billion in cuts, that only
gets us through next year. Next year, our problems are worse
than they are this year, because in all likelihood, with
President Obama in charge, the economy is not going to turn
around.  Because remember what he said on Monday? He said the problem was
the  Tea Party , that’s why we were downgraded. So he misdiagnosed
the problem. And he also said the solution is more spending,
more taxes. So we’re not going to see the economy turn around. .  HUNT:  The  bond market , which is usually a test of
creditworthiness, seems to be saying the S&P rating is
irrelevant, the U.S. Treasuries are the best investment in the
world. What is the bond market telling us?  BACHMANN: That there’s - there’s a malinvestment strategy
available to them. They look at the value of the dollar. The
dollar has lost 12 percent of its value under Barack Obama’s
presidency. They don’t know where to go. You look at world
markets, and world markets are negative right now. And this
still remains the safest haven.  But it’s - it’s kind of like choose your poison. Where do you
want to invest? And right now, it’s still considered the safest,
but it’s not a great investment. It’s a very bad time. The
American economy got an absolute punch in the gut this last
week, if you look at what happened. And so people are trying to
go to the safest place. That’s what it tells me.  HUNT: How would President Bachmann’s policy towards  China  be
different than the Bush and Obama policies?  BACHMANN: Well, my - my policy toward China would be this. I
would be a lot tougher on China when it comes to currency
manipulation. We don’t see the president of the  United States 
put -applying pressure to China -  HUNT: Would you slap tariffs on if they didn’t?  BACHMANN: That would not be something I would want to do, but I
think that there’s a negotiation process that you can do. We
just saw, for instance, China launch an  aircraft carrier . This
is a very serious issue, because now China is in the process of
becoming a top-tier naval -  HUNT: Doesn’t every candidate say, “I’ll be tougher”? What
would you do that would be “tougher”?  BACHMANN: It would be in the form of the negotiations and the
strategies. And there’s things that you can do in negotiations
and strategies that presidents know that are available to them
that you do behind closed doors.  HUNT: Let me ask you a final question. You’re a devout
Christian. Can a practicing homosexual or lesbian be a good
Christian?  BACHMANN: You know, I’m running for the presidency of the United
States. I’m not running to be anyone’s judge. And I think that I
- I ascribe dignity and honor to all people, whatever their
persuasion. I love people. That’s what it comes down to.  HUNT: But can they be a good -  BACHMANN: I don’t care who you are. I love people.  HUNT: Could they be a good Christian?  BACHMANN: That would be - that’s up to God to make that
decision. It’s not up to me. Of course, I think that, if they
have a faith, that is between them and God. That’s - I can’t
intervene.  HUNT: Could you possibly have a lesbian or gay in your cabinet?  BACHMANN: I will have anyone who stands by the Constitution.  HUNT: Even if they were gay?  BACHMANN: That - that is my one and only test. No matter who
they are, it’s the Constitution that I’ll look to.  HUNT: OK, Michele Bachmann -  BACHMANN: And merit.  HUNT: Michele Bachmann, good luck in Ames. Thank you so much for
being with us.  BACHMANN: Thank you. Oh, thank you, Al. Thank you.  ***END OF TRANSCRIPT***  THIS TRANSCRIPT MAY NOT BE 100% ACCURATE AND MAY CONTAIN
