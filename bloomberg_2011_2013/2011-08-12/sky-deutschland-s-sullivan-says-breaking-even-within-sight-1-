Sky Deutschland AG (SKYD) , the German pay-
television operator controlled by  Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp.,
said it may end the year with enough customers to eventually
become profitable.  Sky Deutschland expects to win another 200,000 customers
this year after reaching 2.76 million subscribers at the end of
the second quarter, the company said in a statement today. The
TV company needs between 2.8 million and 3.2 million clients to
achieve a profit before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortization, Chief Executive Officer Brian Sullivan said on a
conference call today.  Breaking even is “within sight,” he said, adding it
depends on the number of subscribers in combination with the
average revenue per subscriber. For 2011, Sky expects a loss of
145 million euros ($207 million) to 175 million euros at the
level of Ebitda.  Sky Deutschland, 49.9 percent-owned by  News Corp. (NWSA) , faces
competition from free TV channels in  Germany . It has raised 400
million euros since Sullivan became CEO last year, investing in
premium services and high-definition TV in a bid to win
customers and stop subscribers from leaving.  Best Performer  Sky Deutschland is the best performer in the mid-cap MDAX
this year, with a 47 percent gain. The stock rose 6 cents, or
2.5 percent, to 2.49 euros at 11:04 a.m. in  Frankfurt , extending
yesterday’s 11 percent surge.  The company’s second-quarter loss before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization narrowed to 23.4 million euros
compared with a loss of 47.4 million euros a year earlier, the
Unterfoehring, Germany-based company said in a  statement . That
was better than the average 32 million-euro loss estimate of 11
analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.  The company’s guidance for new subscribers this year is
“cautious and will be beaten,” said Sarah Simon, an analyst
with Berenberg Bank in  London . The results were “very solid.”  Second-quarter sales rose 17 percent to 276.7 million
euros, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
