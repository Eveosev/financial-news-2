Russia ’s Micex headed for its
biggest weekly loss in more than a year as oil and commodities
plunged on fears the global economic recovery is fading.  The Micex Index of 30 stocks added 0.2 to 1,411.82 by 11:03
a.m. in Moscow, fluctuating between a gain of as much as 1.1
percent and a loss of as much as 0.3 percent. This took its
weekly loss to 9.4 percent, the worst since May 2010.  OAO Rosneft, Russia’s largest oil producer, fell 0.6
percent. OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel, the country’s biggest miner,
jumped 1.7 percent after Citigroup Inc. said the stock was
“oversold.” OAO Sberbank, the nation’s largest lender, slid
1.9 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index added 0.2 percent
to 1,547.09.  Oil, Russia’s main export revenue earner, fell as much as
$1.08 to $84.64 a barrel in  New York . Stocks have tumbled
globally since July 26 after  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded the
U.S. credit rating for the first time and as concern persisted
that  Europe ’s debt crisis is worsening.  “Volatility remains high on equity markets as investors
are quite sensitive to any news developments from the U.S. and
Europe,” Maria Kalvarskaia, who heads equity research at TKB
Capital, said in an e-mailed report today.  Investors withdrew $412 million from Russia-focused equity
funds in the week to Aug. 10, according to UralSib Financial
Corp., citing data from EPFR Global. Leonid Slipchenko, an
equity analyst at UralSib, described the weekly outflow as “one
of the biggest losses in its history,” according to a report e-
mailed today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
