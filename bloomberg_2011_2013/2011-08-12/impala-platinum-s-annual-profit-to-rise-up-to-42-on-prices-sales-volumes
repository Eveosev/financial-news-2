Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP) , the
world’s second-largest producer of the metal, said earnings
probably rose as much as 42 percent on increased prices, beating
analysts’ expectations.  Earnings per share excluding one-time items are expected to
have risen to 10.75 rand ($1.50) to 11.15 rand in the year
through June 30, from 7.86 rand a year earlier, the
Johannesburg-based company said in a statement today. The median
estimate of 13 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg is for 10.70 rand
in per-share earnings excluding one-time items.  Platinum gained 17 percent to an average $1,706.92 an ounce
in the 12 months ended June 30, from $1,454.38 a year earlier as
demand rose for the metal used in jewelry and devices that
reduce car emissions. Impala produces about a fifth of the
world’s platinum, mainly from mines in  South Africa , which has
the world’s largest reserves of the metal.  The trading update is “clearly positive,”  Michael Kavanagh , an analyst at Religare Capital Markets Ltd. in  London ,
said in a note to clients today. “We expect the ZAR basket
price to rise going forward,” he said, referring to the local-
currency price for platinum and related metals, such as
palladium and rhodium.  Impala, which is due to report full-year results on Aug.
25, gained as much as 1.7 percent to 170.01 rand in Johannesburg
trading, and was at 170.91 rand as of 9:54 a.m. Anglo American
Platinum Ltd., the largest producer, was 0.1 percent higher at
530.52 rand.  To contact the reporter on this story:
