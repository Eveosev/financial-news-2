Richard Turnill, a portfolio manager
at BlackRock Investment Management, said economic growth in
 Europe  in 2012 will be lower than most economists and analysts
have forecast because of the region’s debt crisis,  Boersen-
Zeitung  reported today, citing an interview with Turnill.  The recent decline in European stock markets means there
are “high-quality” shares traded at “attractive valuations,”
Turnill said, according to the newspaper.  Globally, the company is finding “first-class” stocks in
the telecoms, healthcare, technology and consumer industries and
also sees opportunities in financial stocks, Boersen-Zeitung
cited Turnill as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
