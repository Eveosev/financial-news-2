Iran’s oil imports from Turkmenistan
have dropped because of “technical problems,” the state-run
 Fars  news agency reported, citing Javad Owji, managing director
of National Iranian Gas Co.  Since Feb. 1, daily imports of gas have declined to as low
as 6 million cubic meters, which is far less than the volume
stated in the contract, Owji said without elaborating, according
to Fars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
