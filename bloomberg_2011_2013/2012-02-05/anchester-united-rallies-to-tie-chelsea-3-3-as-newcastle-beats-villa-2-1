Manchester United  rallied from three
goals behind to tie 3-3 at Chelsea, although the defending
champion still loses ground on rival Manchester City at the top
of English soccer’s Premier League.  Two penalties from  Wayne Rooney  and a goal from Javier
Hernandez earned a point for the Red Devils at Chelsea’s
Stamford Bridge stadium. An own goal by Jonny Evans gave Chelsea
a halftime lead, then Juan Mata and David Luiz increased the
home team’s advantage in the opening five minutes of the second
half.  United now trails City by two points through 24 matches
after its rival beat Fulham 3-0 yesterday. Third-place
Tottenham, which is at Liverpool tomorrow, is six points further
back and has a six-point advantage over Chelsea.  In today’s other match, Papiss Cisse scored on his debut
for Newcastle in a 2-1 win against  Aston Villa .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
