French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  and
Socialist challenger  Francois Hollande  would tie in the first-
round presidential vote in April if the National Front’s Marine
Le Pen fails to qualify, an Ifop poll showed.  Sarkozy and Hollande would each get 33 percent of the vote
followed by  Francois Bayrou  with 17 percent, according to the
poll published today in newspaper  Le Journal du Dimanche . That
compares with an Ifop poll published two days ago that gave
Hollande 29.5 percent of the vote, Sarkozy 24.5 percent and Le
Pen 19 percent.  Le Pen says she has so far failed to gather the 500
endorsements from mayors, lawmakers or other elected officials
that she needs under French law to put her on the presidential
ballot. Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie had also complained of
problems getting endorsements in the lead up to the 2007
presidential election he contested as the previous leader of the
anti-immigration National Front.  Hollande has consistently led Sarkozy in polls ahead of the
first round of voting on April 22. The top two candidates from
the first round face off in the decisive contest May 6.  The Ifop poll of 922 people was carried out Jan. 31 to Feb.
