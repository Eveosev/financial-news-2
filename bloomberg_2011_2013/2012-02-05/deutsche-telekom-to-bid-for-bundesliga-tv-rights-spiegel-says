Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE)  will bid on its
own for broadcast rights for matches in the Bundesliga,
 Germany â€™s top soccer league,  Der Spiegel  reported without saying
where it got the information.  Bonn-based Deutsche Telekom, which so far only holds
Internet TV rights to broadcast the soccer games, now also wants
to bid for satellite TV rights, the magazine said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
