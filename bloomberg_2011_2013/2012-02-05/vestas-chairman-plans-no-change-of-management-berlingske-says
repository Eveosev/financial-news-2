Vestas Wind System A/S (VWS)  Chairman Bent Carlsen has no plans to step down or change the management at
the wind-turbine maker, whose stock lost 65 percent last year,
Berlingske quoted him as saying in an  interview .  The industry is facing challenges and investors shouldn’t
confuse a bad market with bad leadership, Carlsen said,
according to the Copenhagen-based newspaper.  “If management shows action and a will to change things,
then that’s good enough,” the newspaper quoted him as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
