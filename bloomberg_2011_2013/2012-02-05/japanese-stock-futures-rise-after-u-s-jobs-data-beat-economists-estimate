Asian  stocks  rose, with a regional
benchmark index set to extend its longest streak of weekly
advances since 2010, after U.S. unemployment unexpectedly fell,
boosting the earnings outlook for Asian exporters.  Nikon Corp. , a maker of cameras and lenses that gets more
than a quarter of its revenue from  North America , jumped 11
percent in Tokyo after raising its full-year operating profit
forecast. BHP Billiton Ltd., the world’s No. 1 mining company,
gained 1.6 percent in Sydney after commodity prices increased.
 Agricultural Bank of China Ltd. (601288) , the nation’s third-biggest
lender by market value, dropped 2 percent amid concern that a
worsening of Europe’s crisis will hurt China’s economic growth.  “There’s a modestly constructive outlook for share
markets,” said  Andrew Pease , Sydney-based chief investment
strategist for the Asia-Pacific region at Russell Investment
Group, which manages about $150 billion. “In the second half of
last year, talk was all about whether the U.S. will go back into
a recession. Now I think talk will be about what will be the
strength of the recovery in the U.S. That’s an important shift
in the balance of risk.”  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index  climbed 0.4 percent to 124.84
as of 6:39 p.m. in Tokyo, paring an earlier gain of 1 percent.

200 Index increased 1.1 percent.  South Korea ’s Kospi Index and  China ’s Shanghai Composite
Index were little changed.  Singapore ’s Straits Times Index rose
0.8 percent.  Hong Kong ’s  Hang Seng Index  fell 0.2 percent,

today. The index advanced 1.5 percent in  New York  on Feb. 3,
capping a fifth consecutive weekly rally, after Labor Department

since April. The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of
economists was for an increase of 140,000. The  unemployment rate 
dropped to 8.3 percent, the lowest level since February 2009.  Asian exporters gained. Nikon surged 11 percent to 2,064
yen, the second- steepest gain  in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index,
after raising its full-year operating profit forecast by 7.5
percent.  Panasonic Corp. (6752) , a Japanese electronics company that
receives almost half its sales abroad, climbed 6.3 percent to
637 yen, the biggest increase in more than 10 months, after
saying profit in the year beginning April 1 may recover
following a record loss. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. maintained a
“buy” rating on the stock on expectation the company’s
earnings will improve.  Toyota Motor Corp., the world’s largest carmaker by market
value, added 3 percent to 2,986 yen. Samsung Electronics Co.,

A$72.30 after the U.K.-based Sunday Times, without citing

much 40 percent.  Noble Group Ltd. (NOBL) , a Hong Kong-based commodities

the fund’s current projection, the organization said in a report
