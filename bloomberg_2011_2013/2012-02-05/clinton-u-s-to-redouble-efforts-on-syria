The U.S. will “redouble efforts”
with partners outside the  United Nations  to pressure Syrian
President Bashar al-Assad to end violence and step down, U.S.
Secretary of State  Hillary Clinton  said.  The U.S. will work to strengthen international sanctions
against  Syria  and “expose those who are funding the regime,”
Clinton told reporters in the Bulgarian capital of Sofia today.  Russia and China yesterday vetoed a proposal by Western and
Arab countries that backed an Arab League plan to facilitate a
political transition in Syria. It was the second time Russia
blocked attempts at the UN to hold Assad accountable for a
conflict that the UN says has killed more than 5,400 people.  “Faced with a neutered  Security Council , we have to
redouble our efforts outside of the United Nations with those
allies and partners who support the Syrian people’s right to
have a better future,” Clinton said. “Assad must go.”  The  Arab League  in November imposed sanctions on the regime
and sent monitors to the country in an effort to stop the
violence. The league later drafted a plan that called on Assad
to step down in favor of a national unity government.  “We will work to expose those who are still funding the
regime and sending it weapons to be used against defenseless
Syrians, including women and children,” she said. “We will
work with the friends of a democratic Syria around the world to
support the opposition’s peaceful political plans for change.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
