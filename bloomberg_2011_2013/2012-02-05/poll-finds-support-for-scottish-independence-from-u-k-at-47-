Almost half of Scots support
independence from the rest of the U.K., according to a poll
published in the Sunday Times.  The Panelbase poll of 1,000 Scottish adults, conducted
between Jan. 27 and Feb. 1, found 47 percent support becoming
independent against 53 percent who oppose. The newspaper gave no
details about what proportion were undecided or the poll’s
margin of error.  Scotland ’s nationalist First Minister Alex Salmond has said
he wants to hold a referendum on independence in the fourth
quarter of 2014. Prime Minister David Cameron, who supports the
union with Scotland, has said it should come sooner than that.  To contact the reporter on this story:
