Saudi Cement Co. (SACCO)  rose to the highest
in more than three years after the producer of the building
material said cement companies are in talks to sell as much as
600,000 tons of extra clinker supplies.  The  shares  advanced 1.8 percent to 84 riyals at 3:30 p.m in
Riyadh, the highest close since June 2008.  Southern Province
Cement Co. (SOCCO) , which last month posted a 52 percent gain in
quarterly profit, rose 0.9 percent. The benchmark  Tadawul All
Share Index (SASEIDX)  increased 0.4 percent to 6,758.87, the highest close
in more than a year. The  cement index  climbed 1.3 percent,
bringing this year’s advance to 7.7 percent.  Saudi Arabia ’s  cement makers  are benefiting from increased
 government spending , including a $384 billion plan for
infrastructure in the largest Arab economy. Cement production
climbed 13 percent to 48.4 million tons last year, according to
data on the  website of Yamamah Saudi Cement Co.  The kingdom will
require cement producers to operate at full capacity to help end
a supply shortage, Al-Eqtisadiah reported Feb. 4, citing an
unidentified person at the Ministry of Commerce.  “Huge infrastructure projects in the kingdom are boosting
demand,” said Safaa Zbib, senior research manager at Kuwait and
Middle East Financial Investment Co. “Good results and
dividends are the key drivers behind those stocks.”  Saudi Cement’s board last month proposed a second-half
 dividend  of 4.5 riyals a share after paying 2 riyals for the
first six months. The company paid a dividend of 4 riyals for
2010, according to data posted on the  Saudi bourse website .
Fourth-quarter profit surged 40 percent to 212.3 million riyals
($57 million), the company said Jan. 16.  Southern Province gained to 86.75 riyals. The company on
Jan. 17 said fourth-quarter profit rose to 251 million riyals on
higher sales.  To contact the reporter on this story:
