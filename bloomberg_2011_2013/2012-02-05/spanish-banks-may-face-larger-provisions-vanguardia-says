Spanish banks may face provision
requirements from regulators on top of the 50 billion euros ($66
billion) announced by the government on Feb. 3,  La Vanguardia 
said, citing unidentified people familiar with the matter.  The Bank of  Spain ’s head of regulation, Jose Maria Roldan,
and the central bank’s head of financial stability, Daniel
Perez, met banking representatives to explain the government’s
overhaul plan, La Vanguardia said. The regulators may boost the
provisions requirements if needed, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
