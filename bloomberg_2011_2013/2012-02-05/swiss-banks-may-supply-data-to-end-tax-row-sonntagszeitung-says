Many Swiss banks suspected by U.S.
authorities of aiding in tax evasion would prefer to hand over
client data immediately to avoid prosecution, SonntagsZeitung
 said , citing an unidentified head of a Swiss bank.  Following U.S. charges against Wegelin & Co. on Feb. 2, the
risk of a second indictment is too great and banks don’t want to
wait for the countries’ governments to negotiate a solution by
the year’s end, the Swiss newspaper cited the banker as saying.  Banks want to exchange the names of U.S. clients for a
deferred prosecution agreement in a deal similar to the one
struck by  UBS AG (UBSN)  in 2008, the person was quoted as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
