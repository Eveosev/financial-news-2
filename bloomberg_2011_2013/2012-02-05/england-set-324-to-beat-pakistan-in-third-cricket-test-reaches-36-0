England , seeking to avoid being swept
in its three-Test series against Pakistan, reached 36-0 at the
close of play on day three after being set 324 to win.  Alastair Cook  and Andrew Strauss remain unbeaten at Dubai
International Cricket Stadium, although Cook was dropped in the
third over.  Earlier, Pakistan made 365 in its second innings. Azhar Ali
made 157 and Younis Khan 127. England will now need to produce
its second-highest successful run chase in the final innings of
a Test.  Pakistan lost its last seven wickets for 34 runs, with
Monty Panesar leading England’s bowling attack. He took 5-124.  England, cricket’s top-ranked Test team, has struggled in
this series with defeats by 10 wickets, then by 72 runs after a
batting collapse in the second match.  To contact the reporter on this story:
