Turkey ’s lawmakers won’t be able to
complete a new constitution within a year and a half, Aksam
 reported , citing the parliament’s constitutional committee
chairman.  The country will probably remain a parliamentarian system
and the governing Justice and Development Party won’t press for
a presidential system, Chairman Burhan Kuzu said, according to
the Istanbul-based newspaper.  Prime Minister  Recep Tayyip Erdogan , who is serving his
third term and has said he won’t run again, has said he favors a
presidential system. Speaker of Parliament Cemil Cicek, who
heads the effort to rewrite the national charter adopted after a
1980 military coup, has said he aims to complete the process by
year-end.  To contact the reporter on this story:
