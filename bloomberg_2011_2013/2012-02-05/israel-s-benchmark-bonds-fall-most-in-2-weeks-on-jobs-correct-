(Corrects date in last sentence of second graph.)  Israel ’s benchmark bonds dropped the
most in almost two weeks after the U.S. added more jobs than
forecast, fueling optimism about the global economic recovery.  The yield on the 5.5 percent Mimshal Shiklit government
bonds due January 2022 rose three basis points, or 0.03
percentage point, to 4.49 percent 11:35 a.m. in Tel Aviv, the
most since Jan. 23. The  Tel-Bond 40 Index  of corporate bonds
gained for a fourth day, adding 0.1 percent. The  Tel-Aviv 25
Index  increased 0.7 percent to 1,129.44, poised for the highest
close since Jan. 26.  U.S. stocks rose for a fifth week and European stocks
posted the biggest weekly gain this year after Labor Department
figures showed January payrolls increased the most since April.
Yields on Treasuries climbed the most in almost three months as
the jobs data cast doubt on the  Federal Reserve ’s pledge to keep
 interest rates  low through 2014. Israeli bond yields closely
track those in the U.S., one of its largest trading partners.  “Good U.S. job growth data was a boost to equities and is
encouraging risk-taking sentiment today,” Guy Lazarovich, a
bond trader at I.B.I.-Israel Brokerage & Investments Ltd. in Tel
Aviv, said by telephone.  The yield on the CPI-linked bonds due in June 2013 rose two
basis points to 0.27 percent. The one-year break-even rate, the
yield difference between inflation-linked bonds and fixed-rate
government notes of similar maturity, increased three basis
points to 217, implying an average annual inflation rate of 2.17
percent.  Two-year interest-rate swaps , an indicator of investor
expectations for rates in the next two years, were unchanged at
2.47 percent on Feb. 3. The shekel gained 0.3 percent to 3.7078
on Feb. 3, the highest since Nov. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
