Barclays Plc (BARC)  Chief Executive Officer
 Robert Diamond  may be awarded a 2.5 million-pound ($4 million)
to 3 million-pound bonus, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without
saying where it got the information.  Diamondâ€™s bonus will be in addition to a salary of 1.35
million pounds and potential long-term incentives after three
years of as much as 6.75 million pounds, the newspaper said
today.  Simon Eaton, a spokesman at  Barclays Capital  in London,
declined to comment.  The bank will probably announce this week that it exceeded
government lending targets and earned a profit last year of as
much as 6 billion pounds, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
