The  New York Giants  scored a
touchdown to lead the New England Patriots 9-0 during the first
quarter of the Super Bowl.  Each team is seeking a fourth win in the National Football
League championship game. The Giants last took the title by
beating the Patriots after the 2007 season, while New England
hasnâ€™t won since beating the  Philadelphia Eagles  following the
2004 campaign.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
