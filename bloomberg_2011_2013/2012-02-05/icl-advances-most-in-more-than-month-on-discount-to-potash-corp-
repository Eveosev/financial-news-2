Israel Chemicals Ltd. (ICL)  gained the most
in more than a month on investor speculation the shares of the
harvester of chemicals from the Dead Sea are cheap compared with
competitor  Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc.   ICL rose 3.7 percent, the biggest jump since Dec. 25, to
40.54 shekels at the 4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv .  Israel 
Chemicals’ drop of 34 percent over the past 12 months has left
the shares valued at 8.9 times estimated earnings. That compares
with a decline of 24 percent and an estimated price-to-earnings
ratio of 13 times for the Saskatoon, Canada-based company.  “It’s possible that investors have started to pay
attention to the relative underperformance of ICL versus
international peers, notably Potash Corp.,” said Zach Herzog,
equity-sales trader at the Tel Aviv-based Psagot Investment
House Ltd.  In December, Potash asked Israel for approval to boost its
holding in ICL to as much as 25 percent, from its current 14
percent. “Some investors may think there may be some movement
on this front,” Herzog added.  Israel Corp. (ILCO) , which owns 52 percent of Israel Chemicals,
closed at the highest level since Jan. 4, rising 1.5 percent to
2,396 shekels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
