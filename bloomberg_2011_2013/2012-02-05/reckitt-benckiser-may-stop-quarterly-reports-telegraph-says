Reckitt Benckiser Group Plc, the
Slough, England-based maker of household goods, may abandon
quarterly profit reports, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  New Chief Executive Officer Rakesh Kapoor may tell
investors on Feb. 8 that Reckitt Benckiser will shift emphasize
from  Europe  and the U.S. to emerging markets, especially  China ,
the newspaper said. He may also give up quarterly profit
reports, while still providing a sales update every three
months, the Telegraph said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
