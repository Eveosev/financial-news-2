InterContinental Hotels Group Plc (IHG) 
Chairman David Webster may quit his post after eight years, the
Sunday Telegraph reported, without saying where it got the
information.  David Kappler, an independent director, is overseeing the
search for a new chairman, the paper said. Possible candidates
include former Marks & Spencer Group Plc Chief Executive Officer
Stuart Rose, former Royal Mail Group Ltd. Chairman Allan Leighton, and Luke Mayhew, a non-executive director of
InterContinental, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
