Commercial Bank of Kuwait SAK  said
full-year profit plunged 98 percent on “weak”  government
spending .  Net income fell to 810,000 dinars ($2.9 million), or 0.6
fils a share, from 40.45 million dinars, or 31.8 fils, a year
ago, the bank said in a statement to the  Kuwait  bourse today.  “Weak government spending and the retreating performance
of the Kuwait Stock Exchange” impacted “the pace of the
country’s economy and finance,” Chairman Ali al-Awadhi said in
an e-mailed statement today. “A general improvement in the
economic environment and working atmosphere would positively
influence” the lender.  Commercial Bank of Kuwait’s board decided to take all
operational revenue of 101.3 million dinars as provisions
against bad loans “considering current regional and
international conditions that are marred by a great deal of
uncertainty,” according to the statement.  The global credit crisis weakened lending and investment
banking in the  Middle East , pushing up loan-loss provisions and
leading to a drop in the value of investments.  To contact the reporter on this story:
