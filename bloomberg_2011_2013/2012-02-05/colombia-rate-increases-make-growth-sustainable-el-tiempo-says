Colombian central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe says that without recent increases in the nation’s
benchmark rate, the pace of economic growth would be
unsustainable, El Tiempo reported, citing an interview.  Colombia  “hasn’t seen a major impact” on its exports from
the crisis in  Europe  and other developed countries, Uribe  told
the newspaper .  He said gains in the peso are largely driven by changes in
the perceived risk level of Colombian assets, and have little
correlation with the interest-rate differential between Colombia
and the U.S., according to El Tiempo.  To contact the reporter on this story:
