Jordan Telecom (JTEL)  Corp. said profit
dropped by 5.6 percent to 89.8 million dinars ($126.8 million)
in 2011 from a year earlier.  The drop is due to a decrease in operating income and lower
interest rates on bank deposits, Amman-based Jordan Telecom said
in an emailed statement today.  The companyâ€™s subscriber base rose by 17.7 percent from a
year earlier to 3.55 million, it said.  France Telecom  owns a 51
percent share in the group.  To contact the reporters on this story:
