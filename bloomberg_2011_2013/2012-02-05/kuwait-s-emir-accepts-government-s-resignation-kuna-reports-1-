Kuwait ’s Emir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah accepted the government’s resignation, a
routine step following parliamentary elections, the state news
agency  KUNA  reported today.  The cabinet of Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-
Sabah will continue as a caretaker government until a new one is
formed, KUNA said.  Kuwait elected a new parliament on Feb. 2, which will
convene on Feb. 15, KUNA said.  Kuwait’s government must resign and a new one be formed
within two weeks after parliamentary elections are held,
according to the country’s constitution. The newly elected house
must hold its inaugural session within two weeks of elections,
after a new cabinet is formed, in line with the law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
