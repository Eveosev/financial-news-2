Nationalization of platinum assets, a
50 percent windfall tax and a reduction in royalty taxes were
recommended by a study ordered by  South Africa ’s ruling  African
National Congress , City Press  reported , citing the report.  The windfall tax of up to 50 percent should be imposed on
superprofits, which the report defined as a return on investment
of 22 percent, in return for investment in infrastructure and a
reduction in the overall  tax rate , the Johannesburg-based
newspaper said. Royalty taxes should be cut to 1 percent from 4
percent and platinum, regarded as South Africa’s sovereign
resource, should be nationalized through “targeted
interventions,” according to the study, City Press said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
