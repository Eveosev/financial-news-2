Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS)  Vice
Chairman  Michael Sherwood  was granted a bonus in shares worth
almost $10 million, exceeding the $7 million awarded to Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein, the Sunday Times in
London reported.  The bonus for Sherwood, co-chief of the bank in London, was
34 percent down on last year and will be transferred to him over
three years, the Times said. The bonus is in addition to $2.5
million in shares that Sherwood received last week, the
newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
