     Feb. 4 (Bloomberg) -- Newt Gingrich  vowed to stay in the
race for the Republican presidential nomination until the
party’s August national convention in Tampa after his second
consecutive loss to front-runner Mitt Romney.  “We will continue to campaign all the way to Tampa,” the
former U.S. House speaker said at a news conference in  Las Vegas 
following the state’s caucuses.  Gingrich said Republicans want an alternative to Romney.  Gingrich was running second to Romney in Nevada with 39
percent of precincts reporting, according to the Associated
Press tally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
