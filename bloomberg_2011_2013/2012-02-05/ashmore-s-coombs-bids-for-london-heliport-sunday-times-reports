Ashmore Group Plc (ASHM)  Chief Executive
Officer Mark Coombs may bid for London’s only helicopter port,
the Sunday Times  reported  without citing anyone.  Coombs is in talks with  Andrew Davis , founder of  Von Essen
Hotels Ltd. , over the sale of the heliport, which is valued at
about 35 million pounds ($55.4 million), the newspaper said. The
heliport, in the Battersea area south of the Thames, is allowed
to service 12,000 takeoff and landings a year, charging pilots
between 750 pounds and 1,000 pounds per service.  Coombs is facing competition from an investment group that
includes Matrix Group Ltd., the London-based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
