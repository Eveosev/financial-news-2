Iran  started to mass produce a new,
short-range, naval cruise missile, the Zafar,  Tehran Times 
reported, citing Defense Minister Brigadier General Ahmad Vahidi.  A launch ceremony was held yesterday and the first batch of
missiles were delivered to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps
naval forces, the newspaper said.  The Zafar is a short-range, anti-ship, radar-guided cruise
missile which can be installed on various types of vessels and
is able to hit small- and medium-size targets with high
precision, Vahidi said, according to the newspaper.  Iran in September delivered the locally-made Qader cruise
missile to the Guards and the navy, the report said. The Qader
has a range of 200 kilometers (125 miles), flies at a low
altitude and can target destroyers and battleships, the report
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
