Cristiano Ronaldo, who joined Real
 Madrid  from  Manchester United  in 2009, wants to return 
to English soccer’s Premier League at the end of the season, the
 Sunday Express reported .  Ronaldo, who is 27 today, has told family and friends that
he misses United and is unhappy after Madrid fans questioned his
attitude earlier in the season, the newspaper said.  Manchester City  and Chelsea may be interested in signing
the  Portugal  forward, while a return to United could be
possible, the Express said. United would not be prepared to bid
anywhere near the 80 million-pound ($126.5 million) world record
fee paid by Madrid 2 1/2 years ago, the newspaper added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
