Bumi Plc (BUMI)  co-Chairman  Nathaniel Rothschild  will seek peace with Chairman Indra Bakrie as he
tries to end the feud that may oust Rothschild from the
Indonesian miner’s board, the Sunday Telegraph reported, without
saying where it obtained the information.  Rothschild wishes to remain on the Bumi board, the
Telegraph reported, without providing further details of his
effort to reach out to Bakrie. Advisers to Bakrie and to Samin Tan, who together control 47 percent of Bumi’s shares, are due
in  London  at the end of the week to try to persuade
institutional investors to help oust Rothschild, the newspaper
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
