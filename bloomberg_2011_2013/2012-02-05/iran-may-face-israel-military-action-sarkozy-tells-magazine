Iran may face military action by
 Israel  if it doesn’t stop its threats and nuclear program,
French President  Nicolas Sarkozy  said in an interview with the
quarterly  Politique Internationale .  “We know that some in Israel are seriously considering”
military intervention, Sarkozy said in the 32-page long
interview. “If Iran continues its senseless race to get the
bomb and continues to threaten its neighbors, we are facing the
risk of a military intervention,” he said, adding that
everything must be done do avoid a confrontation and to persuade
Iran to abandon its illegal nuclear activities.  The regime of Syria’s President Bashar al-Assad “has lost
all credibility,” Sarkozy said. He reiterated a call by the
U.S., the U.K. and  Germany  for Assad to step down, according to
Politique Internationale.  French troops will remain in  Afghanistan  until 2014, at the
end of the NATO mandate in the country, he told the Paris-based
magazine.  The French leader, who faces re-election in May and hasn’t
yet declared his intention to run, made a detailed review of his
foreign affairs in  the interview  and didn’t respond to questions
about a second term.  To contact the reporters on this story:
