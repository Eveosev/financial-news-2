Saudi Arabian Oil Co., the world’s
largest crude exporter, raised differentials used in determining
its official selling prices for all grades to customers in
Northwest Europe and the Mediterranean for shipments in March.  The state-owned producer, known as  Saudi Aramco , increased
the premium for  Arab Super Light (PGCRSRLT)  crude to  Asia  by 10 cents a
barrel to $4.20 above the average of Oman and Dubai grades, the
Gulf benchmarks used by traders in Asia, while cutting Asian
differentials for four other grades. Aramco reduced all premiums
and discounts for U.S. buyers, the company said in an e-mailed
statement today.  Persian Gulf oil producers such as  Saudi Arabia  sell most of
their crude under long-term contracts to refiners. Most of the
region’s state oil companies price their crude at a premium or
discount to a benchmark.  The following table gives differentials for the regions
into which Aramco sells in relation to benchmark prices, the
month-on-month change and the degrees of gravity as defined by
the  American Petroleum Institute . Differentials are in U.S.
dollars a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
