U.S. authorities are seeking American
tax evaders, not Swiss banks, and an indictment for aiding  tax
evasion  wouldn’t have forced Wegelin & Co. to sell Notenstein
Privatbank AG,  Blick am Sonntag  reported, citing Donald Beyer,
the U.S. envoy to  Switzerland .  The potential outcome of the U.S. prosecution “could not
have brought Wegelin into difficulties,” the Swiss newspaper
quoted Beyer as saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
