The Spanish economy may shrink about
1.5 percent this year, prompting the government to agree with
the European Union on new targets for the country’s budget
 deficit reduction , Economy Minister Luis de Guindos told El
Pais.  Spain ’s current 2012 deficit target of 4.4 percent was set
based on gross domestic product growth of 2.3 percent and is in
agreement with the European Union, de Guindos told  El Pais .  “The deficit reduction should generate confidence but not
a negative impact on the economic evolution,” de Guindos told
El Pais. “The circumstances have changed, but we have
commitments with our communitarian partners so we can’t
unilaterally decide.”  The Spanish government will wait until the European
Commission releases its updated economic forecast before passing
its yearly budget, and will propose a new stability plan, de
Guindos said in the interview.  The country’s government is ruling out a tax increase this
year, de Guindos said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
