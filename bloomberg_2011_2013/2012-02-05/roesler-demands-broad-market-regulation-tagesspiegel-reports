German Economy Minister Philipp Roesler said a financial transaction tax could only be part of a
broader regulation of markets, German newspaper  Der Tagesspiegel 
quoted him as saying.  Regulation should also include a ban on naked short selling
in the European Union, more transparency on over-the-counter
derivatives and shadow banking as well as a limitation of high-
frequency trading, Roesler said according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
