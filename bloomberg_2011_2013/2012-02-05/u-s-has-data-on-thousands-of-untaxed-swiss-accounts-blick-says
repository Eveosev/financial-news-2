U.S. tax authorities hold information
on as many as 29,700 Americans with untaxed Swiss accounts,
 Blick  reported, citing William Sharp, a U.S.-based lawyer.  Of 33,000 Americans who approached authorities to declare
untaxed funds, between 80 percent and 90 percent held Swiss
accounts and the U.S. “now knows exactly how the dirty money
flows,” Sharp said, according to the Swiss newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
