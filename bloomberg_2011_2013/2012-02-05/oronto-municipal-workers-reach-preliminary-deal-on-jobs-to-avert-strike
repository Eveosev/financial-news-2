The city of Toronto and its municipal
workers reached a preliminary agreement on job security and
benefits, avoiding a strike that would have disrupted garbage
pickup and snow plowing.  City and Local 416 union negotiators will continue working
together over the next 48 hours to finish the “framework”
agreement, the union said in an e-mailed statement today.  “There is no doubt that our members are making
sacrifices,” Mark Ferguson, President of Toronto Civic
Employees’ Union, said in the statement. “We are going to keep
working to finalize a deal that gives the city flexibility and
affordability while still delivering great public services.”  Toronto is  Canada ’s business capital and  North America ’s
third-largest financial-services center.  Toronto Civic Employees
Local 416  represents more than 6,000 people, or about 16 percent
of Toronto’s total public workforce of 37,000.  To contact the reporter on this story:
