Former  New York Jets  running back
 Curtis Martin ’s election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame was
“bittersweet” when his mentor, New York Giants coach  Bill Parcells , who led the franchise to two championships, didn’t
make it.  Also admitted yesterday were Jack Butler, a defensive back
who played for the Pittsburgh Steelers from 1951-1959; Dermontti Dawson, a center who played for the Steelers from 1988-2000;
Chris Doleman, a defensive end and linebacker who played for the
 Minnesota Vikings ,  Atlanta Falcons  and  San Francisco 49ers  from
1985-1999; Cortez Kennedy, a defensive tackle who played for the
 Seattle Seahawks  from 1990-2000; and Willie Roaf, an offensive
tackle who played for the  New Orleans Saints  and  Kansas City
Chiefs  from 1993-2005.  Parcells, 70, who coached the Giants to  Super Bowl 
victories after the 1986 and 1999 seasons, was a finalist for
the Hall in 2001 and 2002 after he retired as coach of the Jets.
At that time, he wasn’t covered by rules that require a coach to
be retired for five seasons before being eligible. Yesterday’s
election came in his first year of eligibility under that
requirement. He drafted Martin in 1995 when he was coaching the
 New England Patriots .  Martin, during a media conference, said he would have
stepped aside if he could have given his spot to Parcells.  ‘Bittersweet Moment’  “If I did dream about anything, it would have been going
into the Hall of Fame with the guy that I feel was responsible
for my career being what it had been,” Martin said. “That’s
the only somewhat bittersweet moment for me, is that I was
really looking forward to either Bill going in or us going in
together.”  Martin, 38, was the first New England player to rush for
100 yards in his professional debut. He finished the year as the
American Football Conference’s leading rusher with 1,487 yards
and scored 14 touchdowns, gaining Rookie of the Year honors as
the first of five trips to the  Pro Bowl .  He rejoined Parcells with the Jets in 1998, signing a six-
year, $36 million contract that brought the Patriots a first-
and a third-round draft choice in return.  “He meant so much to my career,” Martin said moments
after his election was announced on NFL Network. “He taught me
to be a professional and had a lot to do with teaching me to be
a man. That man meant everything to my career.”  1,000-Yard Season  Martin and another Hall of Fame member,  Barry Sanders ,
became the only running backs to start their careers with 10
straight 1,000-yard seasons. Martin was the team leader in
rushing each of his 11 seasons in the NFL. He signed as a
restricted free agent with the Jets after his third season and
ran for a career-high 1,697 yards in 2004 for his only NFL
rushing title, at age 31.  Martin’s career ended with a knee injury in 2005. He left
the NFL as the league’s fourth all-time leading rusher, gaining
14,101 yards on 3,518 carries and scoring 90 rushing touchdowns.  “I have never come across a player who has been more
dedicated to the team and doing his job,” Jets General Manager
Mike Tannenbaum said in a statement.  Martin said he wanted Parcells to present him at the Hall
of Fame induction ceremony on Aug. 4.  “There’s God, then there is Parcells, as far as the
importance to my career,” Martin said on the media conference
call.  ‘Done Something Right’  Butler, 84, finished his career with 52 interceptions,
returning four for touchdowns. He was All-NFL three times.  “I must have done something right or I wouldn’t be here,”
he said on the NFL Network. “I never, ever thought I would be
here. When I was a kid I dreamed about going to Canton to the
Hall of Fame, but I never believed my dream.”  Dawson, 46, a second-round draft pick by the Steelers in
1988, spent 13 seasons as the team’s center and went to the Pro
Bowl seven times. During his career, the Steelers led the NFL in
rushing twice. His 170 consecutive games played ranks second in
Steelers’ history.  Doleman, 50, an eight-time Pro Bowl selection, ended his
NFL career with 150 1/2 sacks, fourth all-time, including 21
with the Vikings in 1989.  Kennedy, 43, was named Defensive Player of the Year in
1992, the third winner from a team with a losing record,
registering a career-high 14 sacks 92 tackles for the 2-14
Seahawks.  Roaf, 41, an 11-time Pro Bowl selection, was drafted No. 8
by  New Orleans  in 1993. He played nine years with the Saints
before being traded to the Kansas City Chiefs after his 2001
season.  The Class of 2012 was announced yesterday in Indianapolis,
where the Giants and Patriots will face each other today in the
Super Bowl.  To contact the reporter on this story:
