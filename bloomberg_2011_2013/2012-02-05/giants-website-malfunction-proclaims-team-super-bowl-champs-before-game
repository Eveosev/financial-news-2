The  New York Giants  had a website
malfunction prematurely naming them  Super Bowl  winners
yesterday, on the eve of the National Football League
championship game against the  New England Patriots .  The Giants.com page was headlined “The Giants are Super
Bowl champions!” and directed viewers to the availability of
the team’s championship gear, according to ESPN.  The NFL said the website was prepared for release at the
end of today’s game if the Giants are victorious at Lucas Oil
Stadium in Indianapolis.  “It is common practice for both teams to create web pages
in advance of the conference championship games and Super
Bowl,” the NFL said in a statement obtained by Bloomberg. “In
this case, the hidden URL for the page was inadvertently
available for a brief period of time while it was being
positioned on the NFL server for possible post tomorrow night.”  New York started the season with 25-1 odds to win the
championship. The Giants are a 2 1/2-point underdog today
against the Patriots.  To contact the reporter on this story:
