Scotland ’s Paul Lawrie hit a final-
round 7-under-par 65 to win golf’s Qatar Masters, 13 years after
his first success at the tournament.  The 43-year-old finished on 15-under at Doha Golf Club,
four shots ahead of Australia’s Jason Day and Sweden’s  Peter
Hanson . John Daly of the U.S. was two shots further back.  Lawrie, winner of the British Open in 1999, collects a check
for 316,020 euros ($415,800). It is his seventh victory on the
European Tour and the Scot moves back into the top 50 of the
Official World Golf Ranking for a first time since 2003.  The Qatar Open had been reduced to three rounds after
strong winds two days ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
