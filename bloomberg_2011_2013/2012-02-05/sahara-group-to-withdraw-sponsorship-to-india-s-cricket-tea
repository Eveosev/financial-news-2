Sahara Group, the Indian owner of
assets ranging from television channels to real estate, will
stop sponsoring the nation’s cricket team, according to an e-
mailed statement.  “We are withdrawing from all cricket under the Board of
Control for Cricket in  India ,” Sushanto Roy, managing director
of Sahara Adventure Sports Ltd., said in the statement.  Lucknow, India-based Sahara will pay for the team for about
four months more, Roy said. The board, known as BCCI, is the
governing body for cricket in India.  Sahara will also leave the annual Indian Premier League
cricket tournament because of differences with BCCI, according
to the statement. The group holds the franchise for the Pune
Warriors team based in western India.  To contact the reporter on this story:
