Schroders Plc (SDR) ’s head of U.K.
equities, Richard Buxton, said he’d “happily” vote  Xstrata Plc (XTA) 
Chief Executive Officer Mick Davis off the board if shareholders
aren’t offered enough in the mining company’s sale to  Glencore
International Plc (GLEN) , the Sunday Telegraph reported.  The Glencore and Xstrata boards are discussing a premium of
11 percent to 12 percent, the Telegraph said, without saying
where it obtained the information. Five of the top 10 Xstrata
shareholders said they’re angry the company hasn’t engaged with
them, and the jobs of Davis and Chairman John Bond are at risk
if a sufficient premium isn’t offered, the paper said, without
naming the shareholders.  To contact the reporter on this story:
