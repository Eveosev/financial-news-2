Zimbabwe’s mining ministry has raised
license fees by as much as 5,000 percent, the state-controlled
 Sunday Mail  said, citing a government decree.  Registration of diamond mining licenses, known as claims,
will rise to $5 million from $1 million, while an application
for a platinum mining license has increased to $500,000 from
$200, the Harare-based Sunday Mail said on its website. Should
the application be successful, the license to operate a platinum
mine will climb to $2.5 million from $500, the Sunday Mail
added.  The increase in fees, published by the government, has been
criticized by both small-scale and large-scale miners, the
Sunday Mail said.  Zimbabwe has the world’s second-largest platinum reserves
after neighboring  South Africa .  To contact the reporter on this story:
