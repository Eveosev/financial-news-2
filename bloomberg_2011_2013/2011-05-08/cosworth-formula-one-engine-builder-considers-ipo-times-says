Cosworth Ltd. has appointed JPMorgan
Cazenove to consider an initial public offering that could value
the Northampton, England-based engineering company at 250
million pounds ($409 million), the Sunday Times said, without
saying where it got the information.  The company, acquired from  Ford Motor Co. (F)  in 2004 by U.S.
investors Gerald Forsythe and Kevin Kalkhoven, supplies engines
to three Formula One racing teams, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
