Chinese companies based in  Brazil  have
68 percent higher worker turnover rates than European and U.S.
companies also located in the country,  Folha de S. Paulo 
reports, citing a study by recruitment company Michael Page.  For every 10 employees hired by a Chinese company in
Brazil, at least four leave within 12 months, the Sao Paulo-
based newspaper reported today. Working for these companies
means longer hours, reporting to conference calls late at
night, and unrealistic production goals, Folha said, citing
interviews with former employees and consultants.  To contact the reporter on this story:
