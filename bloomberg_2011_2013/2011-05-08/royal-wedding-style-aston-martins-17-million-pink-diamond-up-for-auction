Auction houses are luring wealthy
buyers with $17 million to spend on a pink diamond, and $9
million for a collection of Aston Martins such as those favored
by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge.  Bonhams is selling factory-made replicas of cars used in
 James Bond movies  as well as convertibles like the Prince of  Wales ’s that William and Kate used on their wedding day. The
auction at Aston Martin’s factory at Newport Pagnell, U.K., on
May 21 includes two DB6 convertibles similar to the Prince’s.
Each is estimated to fetch as much as 250,000 pounds ($411,000).  “At least two billionaires have been buying Aston Martins
aggressively over the last three or four years,” said Dietrich Hatlapa, founder of Historic Automobile Group International
(HAGI), a London-based research company. “The royal wedding
confirmed the car as a British institution, though it’s
difficult to quantify what effect that will have.”  The auction also includes a clone of the DBS that George Lazenby drove in the 1969 film, “On Her Majesty’s Secret
Service,” valued at as much as 70,000 pounds. A version of
Timothy Dalton’s V8 Volante convertible from “The Living
Daylights” (1987) carries a high estimate of 100,000 pounds.
Both cars were made by Aston Martin in 2008.  The auction, containing 46 Astons, is estimated to raise as
much as 5.3 million pounds.  Bonhams  will be holding its 25th annual “Grandes Marques”
auction in  Monaco  on May 20. Sixty-three cars are estimated to
raise as much as 9.9 million euros ($14.4 million). The most
highly valued lot, at 1.45 million euros, is a Ferrari 512 BB/LM
Berlinetta that the North American Racing Team drove in the 1982
Le Mans 24-hour race, finishing ninth.  Top Diamond  A pink diamond the size of a SIM card is the top lot of an
auction in  Switzerland , estimated at as much as 14.8 million
francs ($17 million).  The emerald-cut “fancy intense pink” stone, weighing
10.99 carats and mounted on a platinum ring, will be one of 491
items being offered by Sotheby’s in its biannual jewels sale in
Geneva on May 17 with a total estimate of 42 million francs.  Collectors continue to pay one-off prices for rare
diamonds, particularly if colored. London dealer Laurence Graff
paid 45.4 million francs, a record for any gem at auction, for a
24.78-carat “fancy intense pink” at  Sotheby’s (BID)  Geneva in
November.  “That wasn’t a diamond price. It was a collectors’ item,”
said Sam Taub, director of the Antwerp wholesalers  CLS Diamonds .
“It’s difficult to predict what big stones will make. Each
bidder has a different personal reason for wanting to buy.”  (Scott Reyburn writes about the art market for Muse, the
