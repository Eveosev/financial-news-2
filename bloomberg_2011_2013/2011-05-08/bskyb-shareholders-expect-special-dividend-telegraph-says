British Sky Broadcasting Group Plc (BSY) ’s
institutional shareholders expect the company to pay a special
dividend of about 2.5 billion pounds ($4.1 billion) if  News
Corp. (NWSA)  fails in its bid to buy all the shares of the satellite
broadcaster that it doesn’t own, the  Daily Telegraph  said.  One unidentified BSkyB shareholder said he spoke to
 Nicholas Ferguson , a company director, to emphasize that a bid
of less than 900 pence per share would be insufficient, the
newspaper reported, citing interviews with stockholders. The
shareholders would expect BSkyB to pay a dividend in 12 to 18
months, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
