Royal Dutch Shell Plc planned to
restart an olefins unit today at its Deer Park, Texas, facility.  Olefins Plant 2 was to resume operations at 5 a.m. local
time today, The Hague-based company said in a filing to state
regulators. The unit had been shut because of an equipment
malfunction, Shell said. Olefins are used to make synthetic
fibers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
