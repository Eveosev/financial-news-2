Tokyo Electric Power Co. can’t avoid
raising rates because the shutdown of its Fukushima nuclear
station will force it to pay for alternatives, Minister of
Economy, Trade and Industry Banri Kaieda said today.  “We would like, as much as possible, to keep rates from
rising,” Kaieda said today on Fuji Television.  The March 11 magnitude-9 earthquake and tsunami crippled
the Fukushima Dai-Ichi nuclear plant in northeastern  Japan ,
erasing about 14 percent of total generating capacity of the
utility known as Tepco.  Power shortages have been forecast for the greater Tokyo
area during Japan’s summer, and companies have been urged to
curb usage by as much as a quarter to help conserve energy.  Tepco said last month it plans to add 108 gas- or diesel-
fueled generators to help meet demand. It may boost imports of
liquefied natural gas by 50 percent to compensate for capacity
lost to the March 11 earthquake and tsunami. That could add 500
billion yen ($6 billion) to costs, based on finance ministry
data for last year’s average price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
