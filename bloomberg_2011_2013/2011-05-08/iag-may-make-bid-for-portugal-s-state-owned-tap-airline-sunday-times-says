International Consolidated Airlines
Group SA may bid for TAP SGPS SA,  Portugal ’s state-owned
airline, the Sunday Times said without saying where it got the
information.  Deutsche Lufthansa AG (LHA)  and an alliance between Brazilian
airline  TAM SA (TAMM4)  and Chile’s  LAN Airlines SA (LAN)  may also bid, the
newspaper said. IAG may have hired an investment bank to explore
an offer, the Times said.  “We’re not in talks with anyone at the moment,” Laura Goodes, an IAG spokeswoman, said by phone today. “We’re
focusing on the details of the synergies,” she said, referring
to the January merger of British Airways and  Spain ’s Iberia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
