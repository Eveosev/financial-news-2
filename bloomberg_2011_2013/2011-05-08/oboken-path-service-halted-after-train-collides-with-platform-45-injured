PATH train service to and from
Hoboken,  New Jersey , was suspended today for a police
investigation, according to the system’s  website .  A train operated by the  Port Authority  of New York and New
Jersey, crashed into the platform about 9 a.m. as it was
entering the station in Hoboken, injuring about 45 people, CBS
New York reported. Those people were being treated at area
hospitals, according to the report.  A Port Authority spokesman wasn’t immediately available for
comment.  Spiros Hatiras, chief executive officer of Hoboken
University Medical Center, said 10 patients were taken there,
all of whom had minor injuries.  “They’re being evaluated right now, but there are no major
injuries and no casualties,” Hatiras said in a telephone
interview. Emergency medical staff told them there were about 33
people transported to hospitals, he said.  All other train service is operating, according to the PATH
website, which directed passengers needing to get in or out of
the Hoboken station to use NJT Light Rail.  Hoboken is across the  Hudson River  from  New York City .  To contact the reporters on this story:
