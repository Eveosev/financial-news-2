Israel ’s 10-year government bond rose,
pushing the yield to the lowest level in almost two months, as
concern about the state of the global economic recovery spurred
investors to buy safer assets.  Treasuries climbed last week as a plunge in commodities
reduced concern inflation will climb and investors sought a
refuge from  Greece ’s debt crisis. Crude slid to $97.18 a barrel
on May 6, the lowest close since March 15. Israeli bond yields
closely track those in the U.S., one of its largest trade
partners.  “The decline in yields is directly correlated to the drop
in U.S. yields,” Arie Tal, chief strategist at Alumot-Sprint
Investment House Ltd. in Herzliya, Israel, said by telephone.  The yield on the benchmark Mimshal Shiklit note due January
2020 dropped 4 basis points to 5.22 percent at the 4:30 p.m.
close in Tel Aviv, matching the level on March 17. The extra
yield investors demand to hold Israel’s 5 percent note instead
of similar maturity Treasuries narrowed for the first time since
April 27, declining 4 basis points to 233.2 from 237.1 on May 6.  “Israel’s positive fiscal situation and the central bank’s
gradual increase in its base lending rate justify a tightening
of the spread,” Tal said.  The  Bank of Israel  has increased  interest rates  by 2.5
percentage points since August 2009 in an attempt to rein in
inflation, bringing borrowing costs to 3 percent at the end of
March. Research staff at the central bank expect the benchmark
rate to increase to 4.4 percent, the bank said April 24.  The central bank will raise the rate by a quarter
percentage point to 3.25 percent at its next policy meeting on
May 23, according to 10 of 11 economists, including Tal, in a
Bloomberg survey. The remaining estimate is for the rate to
remain at 3 percent.  The shekel fell 0.5 percent to 3.4563 per dollar on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
