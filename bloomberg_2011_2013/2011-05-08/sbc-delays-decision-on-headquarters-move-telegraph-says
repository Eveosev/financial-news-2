HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA)  will delay a
decision on moving its head office from  London  until after the
U.K.â€™s Independent Commission on Banking recommends whether
banks should split their retail and corporate operations, the
 Daily Telegraph  said.  HSBC executives say they believe proposed requirements that
banks separate retail deposits and loans from corporate ones
could force the company to shrink its loan portfolio, according
to the newspaper. HSBC will delay by up to 12 months its
decision about whether to relocate, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
