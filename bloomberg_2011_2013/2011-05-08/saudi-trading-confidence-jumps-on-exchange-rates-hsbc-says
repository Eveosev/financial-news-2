Saudi Arabia , the biggest Arab
economy, reported the worldâ€™s biggest increase in confidence
among trading partners, helped by exchange rates and response to
government regulations, the HSBC Trade Confidence Index shows.  The kingdom jumped to second place on the index, which
comprises six-month views of 6,390 exporters, importers and
traders in 21 markets, according to an e-mailed report today.  Trader confidence in the  United Arab Emirates  slipped
slightly, while the Middle East and North Africa as a whole
maintained the highest regional average of those surveyed, the
report said.  About 37 percent of traders surveyed said they expect
default risk to increase in the next six months, according to
the report. More than 40 percent said they expect more suppliers
to break agreements with buyers, the report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
