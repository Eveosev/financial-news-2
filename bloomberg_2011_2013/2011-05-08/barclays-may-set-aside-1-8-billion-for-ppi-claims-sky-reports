Barclays Plc (BARC)  may set aside about 1.1
billion pounds ($1.8 billion) as provision for the compensation
of customers who were improperly sold payment protection
insurance policies, Sky News  reported , citing people close to
the bank.  The U.K. lender is expected to disclose the provision in a
statement tomorrow or on May 10 and may follow Lloyds Banking
Group Plc in deciding not to appeal a U.K. industry-wide court
ruling on PPI claims, Sky reported.  Marc Hazelton, a spokesman for Barclays, declined to
comment when contacted by telephone today.  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS)  may also announce a
provision for compensation on PPI claims of more than 1 billion
pounds and may also accept the court ruling, Sky said, without
attribution.  RBS spokesman Nigel Owen declined to comment when contacted
by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
