Arsenal’s title chances were virtually
ended by a 3-1 defeat at Stoke City today in English soccer’s
Premier League.  The Gunners, who remain in third spot, trail first-place
 Manchester United  by six points and would require the league
leader to lose its last three games to have any chance of taking
the title.   United, which plays second-place Chelsea later today, has
73 points, the Blues 70, and Arsenal 67.   Kenwyne Jones, Jermaine Pennant and Jonathan Walters got
Stoke’s goals at the Britannia Stadium to lift their team four
spots to eighth.  Robin van Persie  was Arsenal’s scorer.  Earlier, Wolverhampton Wanderers beat West Bromwich Albion
3-1 to climb out of the relegation positions with two rounds of
matches remaining.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
