HMV Group Plc (HMV)  may be close to selling
its Canadian stores, though talks have stalled on a deal for its
Waterstone’s bookstore chain, the Sunday Times said, without
saying where it got the information.  HMV may sell the Canadian stores for less than 5 million
pounds ($8.2 million), the Times said. Russian investor
 Alexander Mamut  may be willing to pay up to 45 million pounds
for Waterstone’s, while HMV’s board is seeking closer to 70
million pounds, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
