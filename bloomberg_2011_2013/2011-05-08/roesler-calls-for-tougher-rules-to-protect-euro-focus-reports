Philipp Roesler, the German health
minister and designated leader of the Free Democratic Party,
said tougher rules are needed to protect the euro and guarantee
German influence on the currency,  Focus  magazine reported.  Parliament’s participation when using the euro rescue fund
is of “decisive importance” for the FDP, Roesler was quoted as
saying in an e-mailed version of the article. Roesler also
warned of a “rushed exit” from nuclear power, saying his
party’s goal to expand renewable energy can’t happen
“overnight,” he told Focus in an interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
