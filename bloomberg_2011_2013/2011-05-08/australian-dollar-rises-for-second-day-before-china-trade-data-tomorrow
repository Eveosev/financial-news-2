The Australian dollar rose for a second
day before a Chinese report tomorrow that economists said will
show imports increased in April, a sign monetary policy isn’t
crimping the Asian nation’s growth.  The Aussie also snapped last week’s declines versus the
greenback and the yen after a report showed job advertisements
increased for a 12th month. The Australian and  New Zealand 
currencies extended gains as Asian stocks ended a four-day drop,
boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  China  is the largest
importer of Australian raw materials.  “We don’t seem to be getting a huge amount of reaction to
anything that will result in tightening from the People’s Bank
of China, so it’s really just trying to gauge whether the search
for commodities is going to continue,” said  Thomas Averill , a
director in Sydney at Rochford Capital, a foreign-exchange risk
management company. “The Aussie will likely go back beyond
$1.10.”  Australia ’s dollar rose 0.6 percent to $1.0768 as of 12:21
p.m. in  New York  from $1.07 on May 6, after rising to $1.1012 on
May 2, the strongest since it was freely floated in 1983. The
currency climbed 0.7 percent to 86.85 yen. New Zealand’s dollar
appreciated 0.3 percent to 79.27 U.S. cents, and gained 0.3
percent to 63.93 yen.  China’s imports increased 28.9 percent in April from a year
earlier, after gaining 27.3 percent the prior month, according
to a Bloomberg News survey before tomorrow’s report. Exports
rose 29.5 percent and the  trade surplus  widened to $3.2 billion,
separate Bloomberg surveys showed.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index of stocks gained 0.1 percent
after sliding 1.4 percent last week. Crude oil jumped 4 percent,
ending a five-day losing streak.  To contact the reporter on this story:
