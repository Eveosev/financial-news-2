Silentnight Holdings has been sold to
HIG Capital LLC, a U.S. investment firm, after the closely held
U.K. bed maker sought a buyer to prevent collapse, the Sunday
Times reported, without saying where it got the information.  The sale by the founding Clarke family came after attempts
to form a company voluntary arrangement with creditors failed,
the newspaper said. The Times didnâ€™t give a price.  To contact the reporter on this story:
