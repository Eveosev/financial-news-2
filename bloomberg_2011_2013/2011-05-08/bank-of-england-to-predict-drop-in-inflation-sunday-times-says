The  Bank of England ’s inflation report
this week will say that price rises caused by higher fuel costs
are temporary, reinforcing Governor  Mervyn King ’s views, the
Sunday Times said.  The statement will buttress the monetary policy committee’s
approach of keeping  interest rates  at 0.5 percent, the newspaper
said. Prices of oil, silver and other commodities dropped
sharply last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
