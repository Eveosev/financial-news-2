Brazil  imported 70 million liters of
fuel last year from the U.S., compared to 1 million liters the
previous year, Estado de S. Paulo reported, citing the nationâ€™s
commerce department.  Imports of U.S. ethanol jumped on rising demand for fuel
within Brazil, Estado said. The U.S. passed Brazil in ethanol
production in 2006, the newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
