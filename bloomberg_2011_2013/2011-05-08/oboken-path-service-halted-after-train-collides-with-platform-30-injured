A PATH train crashed at a station in
Hoboken,  New Jersey , earlier today, injuring about 30 people,
according to the city.  The train “failed to stop and ran into the train
platform,” according to a statement posted on Hoboken’s
official  website . The New York Times reported on its website
that the train ran into a barrier at the end of the platform.  The statement said there didn’t appear to be any life-
threatening injuries.  Service at the PATH station, operated by the Port Authority
of New York and New Jersey, was suspended and the PATH website
directed passengers to use light rail or the ferry service,
which are also available at the station.  A Port Authority spokesman wasn’t available for comment.  Spiros Hatiras, chief executive officer of Hoboken
University Medical Center, said 10 patients were taken there,
all of whom had minor injuries.  “There are no major injuries and no casualties,” he said
in a telephone interview.  The Hoboken police referred calls about the accident to the
 Port Authority .  All other train service is operating, according to the PATH
 website . Hoboken is across the  Hudson River  from  New York City .  To contact the reporters on this story:
