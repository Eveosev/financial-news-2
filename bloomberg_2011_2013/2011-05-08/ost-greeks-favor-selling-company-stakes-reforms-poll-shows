Most Greeks favor the sale of
government stakes in state-controlled companies and developing
real estate as a way of reducing debt, an opinion poll showed.  Almost 64 percent of the 1,015 Greeks surveyed by Marc SA
for the Athens-based  Ethnos  newspaper favored plans announced by
Greek Prime Minister  George Papandreou  to raise 50 billion euros
($74 billion) in revenue from such sales. The poll also showed
six in 10 Greeks believed government workers shouldn’t have
guaranteed jobs.  Unions have called a general strike for May 11 to oppose
plans to sell stakes in companies including  Public Power Corp SA (PPC) 
and  Hellenic Telecommunications Organization SA (HTO) , the former
electricity and phone monopolies. The sales are part of a total
76 billion euros in measures planned to 2015 to reduce debt and
deficits that prompted a 110 billion-euro bailout from the
European Union and  International Monetary Fund  last year.  More than two-thirds of those surveyed said Papandreou’s
government needed to press ahead with reforms to the economy,
compared with 27 percent who said they should be opposed with
strikes and protests.  The poll, conducted May 3 to May 5, showed Papandreou’s
socialist Pasok party with 24 percent support, compared with
20.2 percent for the opposition  New Democracy  party. The margin
of error is 2.6 percentage points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
