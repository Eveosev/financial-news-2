Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, started operations at its $1.7 billion Moatize coal
mine in northwest Mozambique.  The mine will produce 11 metric tons of metallurgic and
thermal coal a year, the Rio de Janeiro-based company said today
in a statement handed to reporters in Tete, 2,000 kilometers
(1,250 miles) north of the capital Maputo.  Mozambique aims to cut poverty in the southern African
country by developing resources including coal, gold, natural
gas, tantalite, heavy sands, phosphates, iron and graphite.  “Extractive industry has a big role in fighting against
poverty in our country,” President Armando Guebuza said when he
officially opened the mine today. The government is working on
becoming a “safe investment destination,” he said.  Moatize employs 7500 workers and its coal will be
transported along a 600-kilometer railway line to the port of
Beira in central  Mozambique , according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
