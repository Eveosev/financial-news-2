Ten Egyptians were killed and 186
injured in yesterday’s clashes outside two churches in Cairo,
the state-run Middle East News Agency reported, citing Hisham
Shiha, a Health Ministry official.  The North African country’s Cabinet was scheduled to hold
an extraordinary meeting today, and Prime Minister Essam Sharaf
canceled a trip to Bahrain and the  United Arab Emirates 
following the violence.  The clashes began after about 1,000 people gathered outside
of the Saint Mina Church in the Embaba neighborhood following
rumors that a Christian woman who recently converted to Islam
was being held inside it. Two groups, which appeared to be spilt
along sectarian lines, hurled stones at each other and exchanged
gunfire. Security forces later moved in and dispersed the groups
and imposed a curfew on part of the district.  The ruling Supreme Council of the Armed Forces said today
it referred 190 people to trial at a military court after
arresting them following the clashes. The council said on its
Facebook page that those involved in the clashes will face the
“utmost penalty” and called on citizens to confront “this
attempt to rip apart the nation’s fabric”.  To contact the reporter on this story:
