Cincinnati Bell Inc. (CBB) , the Ohio-based
telephone and wireless company, said it reached a new labor
agreement with unions representing about 1,000 workers.  The tentative 39-month agreement with the  Communications
Workers of America  was announced yesterday, hours before the
current three-year deal was to expire, the Cincinnati-based
company said in a statement. The union represents about
about a third of the company’s 3,000 employees.  The pact includes pay raises and changes to pension and
retirement benefits, the statement said, without providing
further details.  Company spokeswoman Lisa McLaughlin wasn’t able to provide
further details. Spokesmen for the union didn’t return phone
call made to their offices.  Members of Locals 4400 and 4401 will vote on the agreement
via mail ballot and the company expects the contract ratified in
June, according to the statement.  On May 5, Cincinnati Bell reiterated its revenue forecasts
for the quarter and the year. The stock rose almost 10 percent
on Friday, the biggest gain in more than two years, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company said it expected revenue for 2012 to be $1.4
billion, with profit excluding some costs of about $530 million.  Shares of Cincinnati Bell rose 29 cents, or 9.9 percent, to
$3.23 on May 6. That’s the biggest jump since January 23, 2009,
the data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
