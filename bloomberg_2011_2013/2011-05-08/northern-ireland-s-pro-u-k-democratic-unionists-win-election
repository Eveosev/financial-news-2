Northern Ireland ’s pro-U.K. Democratic
Unionist Party won the most seats in the region’s  assembly 
elections, with the nationalist  Sinn Fein  coming second.  The DUP won 38 seats, a gain of two from the 2007 election,
and Sinn Fein won 29 seats, a gain of one. The Ulster Unionist
Party won 16 seats, and the moderate nationalist Social and
Democratic Labour Party won 14 seats, a loss of two for each
party. The cross-community Alliance Party won eight seats.  The result in the May 5 election means the DUP and Sinn
Fein will take the First Minister and Deputy First Minister
positions and will have first choice of ministries, including
finance, in the power-sharing assembly. The 108-seat assembly
was revived in 2007, two years after Sinn Fein’s Irish
Republican Army ally decommissioned its weapons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
