Japanese stock futures fell on
speculation that a government request to shut a nuclear reactor
located close to an earthquake fault-line may hurt the economy.
Australian futures declined after  oil prices  dropped.  American depositary receipts of  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203) , the
world’s largest carmaker, lost 0.5 percent from the closing
share price in Tokyo. Those of  Kyocera Corp. (6971) , a Japanese
electronic components maker that gets 20 percent of its revenue
from Europe, sank 0.6 percent after the yen strengthened against
the euro, cutting its earnings outlook for exporters. ADRs of
 Woodside Petroleum Ltd. (WPL) , Australia’s second-biggest oil and gas
producer, declined 0.5 percent.  Futures on Japan’s  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average expiring in
June closed at 9,785 in Chicago on May 6, compared with 9,850 in
Osaka, Japan. The futures were bid in the pre-market at 9,830 in
Osaka, at 8:05 a.m. local time. Futures on Australia’s S&P/ASX
200 Index slid 0.2 percent today. New Zealand’s NZX 50 Index was
little changed in Wellington.  Chubu Electric Power Co.’s board met to discuss a possible
closure of its sole nuclear plant after Japanese Prime Minister
 Naoto Kan  expressed concern the Hamaoko facility may not be able
to withstand a powerful earthquake and tsunami.  “A lot of industrial-use products such as cars and
electronics parts are produced in the Chubu district,” said
 Kazuhiro Takahashi , a general manager at Daiwa Securities
Capital Markets Co. in Tokyo. “The uncertainty about the
government measures toward nuclear power is a negative factor
for stock prices.”  Earthquake Risk  Kan on May 6 asked Japan’s third-biggest utility to shut
its Hamaoka power plant, citing a government study that showed
an 87 percent likelihood of a magnitude-8 quake striking the
area within 30 years. It is the first government request to
close reactors since a temblor and tsunami hit northeastern
 Japan  in March and caused the world’s worst nuclear accident in
25 years.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.4 percent
today. In  New York , the index gained 0.4 percent to 1,340.20 on
May 6 as stronger-than-forecast growth in jobs bolstered
confidence in the world’s largest economy.  Crude oil for June delivery tumbled 2.6 percent to $97.18
a barrel on May 6 in New York, the lowest settlement price since
March 15.  Copper Falls  Copper fell to a five-month low on concern that demand for
industrial metals may slow as countries including China, the
world’s largest copper buyer, boost  interest rates  to curb
inflation. Copper futures for July delivery dropped 0.6 percent
to close at $3.9755 a pound in New York on May 6. The price
earlier touched $3.928, the lowest since Dec. 1.  The euro fell the most in four months against the dollar
after European Central Bank President  Jean-Claude Trichet 
signaled he may not raise interest rates next month and concern
grew that Greece’s debt crisis is worsening.  The euro depreciated to as much as 114.99 yen today in
 Tokyo , compared with 117.18 at the close of  stock trading  on May
6. A weaker euro cuts the value of European income at Japanese
companies when converted into their home currency.  The MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.1 percent this year
through May 6, compared with gains of 6.6 percent by the S&P 500
and 2 percent by the Stoxx Europe 600 Index. Stocks in the Asian
benchmark are valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings on average,
compared with 13.6 times for the S&P 500 and 11.3 times for the
Stoxx 600.  Today, 60 of the 1,022 companies in the MSCI index are
scheduled to release earnings statements. Of the 389 companies
that have reported results for the latest quarter, 155 have
exceeded analysts’ estimates, while 151 have missed them,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
