The euro erased its gain versus the
dollar and fell below $1.43 for the first time in more than two
weeks as Standard & Poor’s reduction in  Greece ’s credit rating
renewed concern the region’s debt crisis is worsening.  The 17-nation currency rose earlier as a report showed
exports in  Germany , Europe’s largest economy, jumped in March,
bolstering the case for higher  interest rates  in the euro
region. The pound depreciated after the  Confederation of British
Industry  lowered its economic growth predictions and a report
showed  house prices  unexpectedly fell.  “The S&P downgrade is just rubbing salt in a wound and
confirmed everyone’s suspicions that Greece is essentially in a
quasi default state,” said Boris Schlossberg, director of
research at the online currency trader GFT Forex in New York.
“You are still seeing some relatively good data out of the  euro
zone , so we are living in a bifurcated world.”  The euro decreased 0.2 percent to $1.4290 at 10:13 a.m. in
New York, compared with $1.4316 on May 6, after touching
$1.4273, the lowest level since April 19. The currency earlier
rose 0.9 percent to $1.4442. The euro traded at 115.33 yen,
compared with 115.44, after earlier rising 0.9 percent to
116.48. The dollar fetched 80.71 yen, compared with 80.63.  Futures traders increased their bets that the euro will
gain against the  U.S. dollar  as of May 3, figures from the
Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission show. Net
longs increased to 99,516 last week, the most since 2007,
compared with 68,279 a week earlier.  Greece’s Rating  Greece’s credit rating was cut to B from BB- by S&P, which
said further reductions are possible, with private investors at
risk if maturities are extended on the nation’s emergency-aid
package. Another rating cut would make Greece the lowest-rated
country in  Europe  as today’s move left it even with Belarus
after the fourth reduction by S&P since April 2010.  “It raises the stakes just that little bit more, in view
of the ongoing debate on how Greece is going to deal with its
ongoing problems,” said  Jeremy Stretch , executive director of
foreign- exchange strategy at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce
in London. “It’s another short-term headwind for the euro to
take onboard. International investors sitting on the outside
looking in probably regard it as another reason to fight shy of
the euro.”  Officials in  Athens  spent the weekend denying speculation
that Greece was headed out of the euro or into default after a
gathering of finance ministers and a Spiegel magazine report
that Greece was considering a return to the drachma.  Aid for Greece  Luxembourg Prime Minister  Jean-Claude Juncker  told
reporters after the meeting that a new aid package for Greece
was in the works. The extra money may require Greece to provide
collateral or expand a plan to sell 50 billion euros of state
assets, said a person with direct knowledge of the situation.
Greece may also win easier repayment terms and deficit
conditions on the original bailout.  Europe’s currency has risen 2.9 percent this year,
according to Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Currency Indexes, a
measure of the currencies of 10 developed nations. The yen has
weakened 4.6 percent, while the dollar is down 5.1 percent.  The euro rose earlier versus the dollar as a government
report showed that Germany’s exports jumped 7.3 percent in March
from a month earlier. The median forecast of 10 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 1.1 percent increase.  Norway’s krone rallied 0.7 percent to 5.4966 versus the
dollar in the best performance among the most-traded currencies
as crude rose after its biggest weekly drop since 2008. The
Canadian dollar erased its gain, trading at 96.64 cents versus
the U.S. currency after appreciating 0.6 percent on the rebound
in crude oil.  Rebound in Crude  Crude for June delivery rose 2.1 percent to $99.20 a barrel
in electronic trading on the  New York  Mercantile Exchange.
Norway is the world’s seventh-largest exporter of crude oil,
while Canada is the biggest exporter of crude oil to the U.S.  The pound weakened versus the euro as the Confederation of
British Industry, the U.K.’s biggest employers’ group, said U.K.
gross domestic product will rise by 1.7 percent in 2011,
compared with a February estimate of 1.8 percent. U.K. house
prices fell the most in seven months in April, a report from
Halifax, the mortgage unit of Lloyds Banking Group Plc, showed.  Sterling declined 0.2 percent to 87.63 pence per euro and
slid 0.3 percent to $1.6369.  IntercontinentalExchange Inc.’s Dollar Index, which tracks
the greenback against the currencies of six major U.S. trading
partners, was little changed at 74.901 after decreasing 0.5
percent to 74.436. The gauge rose to 74.925 on May 6, the
highest level since April 20.  Payrolls in the U.S. grew by 244,000 last month in the
seventh monthly gain after increasing by a revised 221,000 in
the prior month, the Labor Department reported May 6.  To contact the reporters on this story:
