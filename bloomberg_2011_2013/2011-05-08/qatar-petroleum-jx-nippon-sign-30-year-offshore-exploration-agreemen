Qatar Petroleum , the state-run energy
company, and JX Nippon Oil & Gas Exploration Corp. signed a 30-
year agreement to explore for gas off the northeast coast of the
emirate.  JX Nippon pledged an initial investment of $100 million to
explore so-called block A, located in an area of 6,173 square
kilometers, Saad Sherida Al-Kaabi, Qatar Petroleum’s director of
oil and gas ventures, said at a signing ceremony in Doha today.
Additional money may be invested if gas is produced from the
block, he said.  Qatar, holder of the world’s third-largest gas reserves and
the biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, seeks to increase
gas output from areas outside the North Field, the world’s
biggest gas reservoir. A moratorium has halted new development
of the North Field until at least 2014.  Qatar Petroleum signed three agreements in the past two
years with international companies to explore for gas off the
country’s coast.  China  National Petroleum Corp. and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc signed a 30-year agreement last May to explore block
D. Cnooc Ltd., China’s biggest offshore oil explorer, signed a
separate 25-year agreement in August 2009 to search for gas in a
separate area.  Block A will be JX Nippon’s first exploration project in
Qatar, Makoto Koseki, the company’s chief executive officer,
said today. The company, an exploration subsidiary for JX
Holding Inc., produces 140,000 oil-equivalent barrels a day of
oil and gas, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
