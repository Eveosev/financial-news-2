Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  Flight 1706 was
allowed to proceed to  San Diego  after the FBI found no
suspicious devices on the plane following its diversion to
Albuquerque, New Mexico.  The Boeing 737-800, with 137 passengers and six crew
members, was diverted to Albuquerque Sunport International
Airport about 10 a.m. local time, Frank Fisher, a spokesman for
the  Federal Bureau of Investigation , said in an e-mail. The
passengers and crew were interviewed after the plane landed, he
said.  The passengers and carry-on luggage were screened by a
canine team and nothing was found after a search of the plane,
J. Kawika Riley, a spokesman with the  Transportation Security
Administration , said in an e-mail. The FBI, Atlanta-based Delta
and TSA declined to specify what type of device they were
looking for or give any other details.  The aircraft took off from Detroit at 8:53 a.m. local time,
according to flight tracking website  FlightView.com.  It was
diverted “out of an abundance of caution,” the airline said.
The plane landed in Albuquerque at 10:53 a.m. local time,
according to Delta’s website.  Separately,  United Continental Holdings Inc. (UAL) ’s Flight 546
made an emergency landing in  St. Louis  at 1:28 p.m. local time
after a passenger tried to open a door in flight, the Chicago
Tribune  reported , citing a former Tribune reporter who was on
the aircraft and the Federal Aviation Administration.  To contact the reporter on this story:
