South Africa ’s Thomas Aiken claimed
his first European Tour golf title with victory at the Spanish
Open, a tournament overshadowed by the death of three-time
winner Severiano Ballesteros.  Aiken, 27, who finished on 10-under-par 278 in Barcelona
today after a final-round 70, collected a check for 333,330
euros ($477,200). He was two shots ahead of Denmark’s Anders Hansen, with Pablo Larrazabal of Spain and Scott Jamieson of
Scotland one shot further back.  Players wore black ribbons in memory of five-time major-
winner Ballesteros.  “It’s been a sad week with Seve passing away,” Aiken told
reporters. “I definitely want to dedicate this win to him with
it being his home Open and what he gave to his home fans and to
golf.”  Ballesteros,  Europe ’s most successful golfer, died at his
home in Pedrena, Spain, early yesterday morning at age 54. He
won the British Open three times and the Masters Tournament
twice among a total of 87 titles worldwide.  There was a minute’s silence today and flags flew at half-
mast.  “I just played the most difficult round of my life,” said
Jose Maria Olazabal, a friend and former Ryder Cup colleague of
Ballesteros. “It was very tough to make it to the first tee and
hit the first drive.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
