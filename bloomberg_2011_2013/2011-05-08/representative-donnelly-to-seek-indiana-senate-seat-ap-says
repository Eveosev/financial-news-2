Indiana Democratic Representative Joe Donnelly will say tomorrow that he will run for the U.S. Senate
seat now held by Senator  Richard Lugar , the  Associated Press 
said, citing two Democrats with knowledge of his plans.  The congressman is running because he believes Lugar will
lose the Republican primary, which will improve his chances of
winning, the  news agency  said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
