Commerzbank AG (CBK)  Chief Economist Joerg Kraemer said it would be “economic suicide” for Greece to
return to the drachma, which would prompt a run on local banks
to withdraw euros,  Welt  reported, citing an interview.  Thomas Mayer , chief economist at Deutsche Bank AG, said a
Greek exit from the euro region would lead to a crisis in
Europe’s political and currency union and could cause a bank run
in some EU countries, the newspaper said.  Thomas Straubhaar, head of the Hamburg-based HWWI economic
institute, told the newspaper a euro exit could force Greece
into bankruptcy and cause a “domino effect” like the collapse
of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
