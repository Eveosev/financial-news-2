Corn and soybeans may rise this week
as flooding and delayed plantings in the U.S. and  Canada  coupled
with dry weather in  China  and Europe threaten global production.  Nineteen of 26 traders and analysts surveyed from Tokyo to
Chicago on May 6 said corn will rise, and 21 of 27 respondents
forecast a gain for soybeans. Last week on the Chicago Board of
Trade, corn futures for July delivery fell 9.3 percent to
$6.8625 a bushel, the biggest drop since October. Soybeans for
July delivery dropped 4.9 percent to $13.26 a bushel.  Last weekâ€™s declines in corn and soybeans were a surprise
to the majority of respondents surveyed on April 29. Since 2004,
the surveys have been correct 55 percent of the time for corn
and 54 percent for soybeans.  Bullish on corn: 19    Bullish on soybeans: 21
Bearish on corn:  7    Bearish on soybeans:  6  To contact the reporter on this story:
