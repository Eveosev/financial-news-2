Barcelona beat city rival Espanyol 2-0
to move to within one point of clinching its third straight
Spanish soccer title.  Andres Iniesta  and  Gerard Pique  got the goals at the Camp
Nou yesterday to help Barcelona maintain its eight-point lead
over Real  Madrid , which won 6-2 at Sevilla two days ago as
Cristiano Ronaldo got four goals.  Barcelona, which has a superior head-to-head record against
Real, has 91 points with three games remaining and can clinch
its 21st league title by avoiding defeat at Levante on May 11.
Should Real fail to beat Getafe tomorrow, the championship will
go to Barca regardless of its result the following day.  In  Italy , Inter Milan boosted its grip on second spot in
Serie A yesterday with a 3-1 win over Fiorentina as Napoli lost.  Giampaolo Pazzini, Esteban Cambiasso and Coutinho got the
goals for Inter, which won the past five league titles. Alberto Gilardino replied for the visitor. Napoli lost 2-1 at Lecce.  AC Milan sealed its first league crown since 2004 two days
ago with a 0-0 tie at Roma. Milan has 78 points, Inter 72 and
Napoli 68, with two rounds remaining.  In  France , defending champion Marseille missed the chance
to move to within a point of leader Lille as it lost 3-2 at Lyon
last night. Lille had taken a four-point lead atop the standings
two days ago with a 1-0 win at Nancy.  Borussia Dortmund , which has already clinched the German
title, lost 2-0 at Werder Bremen two days ago.  Bayern Munich 
beat St. Pauli 8-1 to guarantee a Champions League place and
condemn its Hamburg-based opponent to relegation.  In the Netherlands, FC Twente clinched the first part of a
possible cup-and-league double with a 3-2 win over Ajax after
extra time in the final of the KNVB Beker.  The teams meet again in the final round of league games
next weekend in a match that will decide the championship.
Twente has a one-point lead over Ajax at the top.  WEEKEND RESULTS
