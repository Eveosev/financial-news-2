Hans-Werner Sinn, president of
 Germany ’s Ifo economic institute, said  Greece  would be better
off if it left the euro, Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung
reported, citing an interview.  Greece’s exit from the  euro zone  would be “the lesser of
two evils,” Sinn told the  newspaper . Greece could devalue its
currency and improve its competitiveness without the common
currency, he said, according to the newspaper.  To contact the reporter on this story:
