At least 17 people, including 6
security officers, were killed in a clash at a  Baghdad  prison
after al-Qaeda inmates held for a church attack seized the
weapons of their guards, the National Iraqi News Agency said.  Eleven inmates jailed for the Oct. 31 deadly attack on the
Our Lady of Salvation church in Baghdad were killed in the dawn
shootout, it said, citing Baghdad security forces spokesman
Qasim Ata.  Among the convicts killed was Huzhayfa al-Batawi, it said.
Batawi is the suspected al-Qaeda leader of the group that
attacked the Syriac Catholic church, killing 58 worshipers
during evening mass. Top anti-terror officer Brigadier Muayad
Salih was among the security forces killed.  Al-Qaeda in  Iraq  has vowed to continue targeting the
country’s Christian minority. At least seven people were wounded
by a roadside bomb outside the entrance of Baghdad’s Sacred
Heart church on April 24.  To contact the reporter on this story:
