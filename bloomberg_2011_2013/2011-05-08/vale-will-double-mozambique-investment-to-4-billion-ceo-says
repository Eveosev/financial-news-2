Vale SA (VALE3) , the world’s largest iron-ore
producer, will double investments in Mozambique to $4 billion in
the next four years, said Chief Executive Officer  Roger Agnelli .  The Rio de Janeiro-based company invested $2 billion since
it acquired the Moatize coal mine in 2004, he told reporters
today in Tete province, 2,000 kilometers (1,250 miles) north of
the capital Maputo.  Vale started operations at the $1.7 billion Moatize site
today. The mine will produce 11 metric tons of metallurgic and
thermal coal a year, the company said. Moatize employs 7,500
workers and its coal will be transported along a 600-kilometer
railway line to the port of Beira in central Mozambique.  Vale plans to set up a coal-to-liquid plant in  Mozambique ,
Agnelli said, declining to give more details. The southern
African country’s government supports the plan to produce fuels
from coal, said Mineral Resources Minister Esperanca Bias.  “We want to add value to coal produced in the country,”
she said in an interview. “But first we have to see how the
project is operating.”  Agnelli, who leaves Vale at the end of this month, said he
“will continue working with the company as I am also a
shareholder.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
