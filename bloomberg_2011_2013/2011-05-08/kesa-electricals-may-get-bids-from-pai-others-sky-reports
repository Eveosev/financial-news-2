Kesa Electricals Plc (KESA) ,  Europe ’s third-
largest electronics retailer, may get bids from leveraged buyout
firms including PAI Partners,  Sky News  reported, without saying
where it got the information.  An unidentified buyout firm is interested in Kesa’s French
retail chain, Darty, and considers its U.K. chain, Comet, of
“no economic value,” according to the report. Kesa and PAI
declined to comment, according to the report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
