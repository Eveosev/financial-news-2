Takaful Emarat Insurance PSC, a joint
venture between the  United Arab Emirates ’ Al Buhaira National
Insurance Co. and UNIQA Group Austria, plans to boost gross
written premiums more than fourfold this year.  The Shariah-compliant company is targeting 65 million
dirhams ($18 million) in gross written premiums compared with 14
million dirhams last year, General Manager Ghassan Marrouche
said at a conference in Dubai today.  “Medical insurance is becoming compulsory, so we will see
a rise in demand,” Marrouche said. “We have many more products
in the pipeline.”  Takaful Emarat began offering three new savings plans --
education, general savings and wealth management for individuals
-- in the first week of April, he said. The plans may contribute
as much as 10 million dirhams to gross premiums this year, he
said. "The products can be linked to over 20 funds, but
participants can invest in 10 funds at one time," he said.  Takaful Emarat is looking to expand services to the Middle
East and  Asia , helped by demand in countries such as Jordan,
Syria, Pakistan and  India , Marrouche said.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
