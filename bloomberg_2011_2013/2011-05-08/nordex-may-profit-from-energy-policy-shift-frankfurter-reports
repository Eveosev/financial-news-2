Nordex SE (NDX1) , a German wind-turbine
maker, may profit in 2012 at the earliest from the shift in
German energy toward more renewable sources, Frankfurter
Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung reported, citing Chief Executive
Officer Thomas Richterich.  Germany  may install as much as 3,000 megawatts in new wind
power by 2012, he told the  newspaper . Nordex is “content” with
the first quarter and is sticking to its-full year target,
though 2011 will be “another difficult year” because of
overcapacity in the market, Richterich said in the interview.
The company has financing until 2013 and doesn’t plan further
capital measures, according to the interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
