Irish consumer confidence fell in
April as companies including the state-owned postal service and
 Allied Irish Banks Plc (ALBK)  said they plan to cut jobs and officials
said the cost to bail out the nation’s banks rose.  The consumer sentiment index declined to 57.9 from 59.5 in
March, KBC Ireland and the  Economic & Social Research Institute 
in Dublin said today in an e-mailed statement.  Ireland’s central bank said on March 31 that four of the
country’s banks included in the government’s guarantee need to
raise 24 billion euros ($34.4 billion) between them. Allied
Irish said last month it will cut over 2,000 jobs by 2012 as its
losses widened to a record. The country’s postal service, An
Post, said on April 28 it will shed almost 2,000 jobs by 2015.  “The surprise in terms of the April sentiment results is
not that Irish  consumer confidence  weakened last month, but that
the decline was very limited,”  Austin Hughes , chief economist
at KBC Ireland, said in the report. The “relatively small”
drop “might suggest Irish consumers feel they have prepared
themselves for whatever a relatively tough year may bring.”  A measure of households’ expectations slipped to 42.3 from
49.9 in March. KBC’s gauge of how consumers viewed their current
situation rose to 81 in April from 73.8 the previous month.  To contact the reporter on this story:
