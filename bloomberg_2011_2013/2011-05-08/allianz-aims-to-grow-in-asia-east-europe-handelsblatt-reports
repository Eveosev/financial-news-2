Allianz SE (ALV)  aims to double the share of
total revenue from  Asia  and eastern  Europe  from about 12 percent
over the next decade,  Handelsblatt  said, citing an interview
with Manuel Bauer, the board member overseeing growth markets.  The Munich, Germany-based insurer wants to boost its stake
in Indian joint venture Bajaj Allianz General Insurance Company
Ltd. to 49 percent from 26 percent in the “foreseeable
future,” the newspaper said, citing the interview. Allianz
doesn’t plan acquisitions in eastern Europe in the near term and
will focus on organic growth in the region, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
