Qatar’s Oil Minister Mohammed bin
Saleh al-Sada said it is too early to say whether OPEC will
decide to pump additional crude at its next meeting in June.  A stable oil price is a goal of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, and markets are well-supplied, he
told reporters in Doha. The global economy is not weak enough to
justify a freefall in crude prices, al-Sada said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
