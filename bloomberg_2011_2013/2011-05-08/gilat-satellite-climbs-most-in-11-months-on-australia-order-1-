Gilat Satellite Networks Ltd. (GILT)  advanced
the most since June after the Israeli developer of satellite-
networking technology received an order that may be valued at as
much as $120 million over a five-year period.  The shares increased 7.2 percent to 16.72 shekels at the
4:30 p.m. close in  Tel Aviv . U.S.-traded shares climbed 4.7
percent to $4.92 on May 6, while local markets were closed for
the weekend.  Gilat will provide a SkyEdge II Very Small Aperture
Terminal to Optus Networks Pty Ltd. for the Australian
government’s National Broadband Network Co.’s Interim Satellite
Service, it said May 6 in a Globe Newswire statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
