The former head of  Israel ’s Mossad
intelligence agency called the idea of an Israeli strike on
 Iran ’s nuclear facilities “the stupidest think I have ever
heard,” Haaretz said, citing comments Meir Dagan made at a
private conference at the Hebrew University of  Jerusalem  on
Friday.  Dagan said such a strike would lead to war with Iran, “the
kind of thing where we know how it starts, but not how it will
end,” Haaretz said.   Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
