European Central Bank Governing
Council member Ewald Nowotny said it’s “technically and
economically inconceivable” for any members of the euro to leave
the currency union, according to Profil magazine.  Nowotny considers speculation that debt-burdened nations
will leave the euro to be “absurd,” the Vienna-based paper said.  “The citizens of these countries would immediately storm
the banks to get their savings to safety, which then would lead
to an immediate collapse of these banks,” Nowotny was cited as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
