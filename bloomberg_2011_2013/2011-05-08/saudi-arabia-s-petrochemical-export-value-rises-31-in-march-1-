The value of Saudi Arabia’s
petrochemical exports rose 31 percent in March from a year
earlier on higher prices and increased demand from  Asia .  The kingdom, holder of the world’s largest oil reserves,
shipped 4.7 billion riyals ($1.3 billion) of petrochemicals,
compared with 3.6 billion riyals last year, according to data on
the Department of Statistics and Information’s  website . Exports
were also up 31 percent from February, the data show.  The value of non-oil exports climbed 18 percent to 13.9
billion riyals in March from 11.8 billion riyals a year earlier.
Volumes increased 7 percent to 4.23 million metric tons, the
department’s data showed.  Petrochemicals in March accounted for 34 percent of the
country’s non-oil exports, while plastics comprised 33 percent,
the data showed.  Saudi Arabia imported petrochemical and plastics products
worth 3.5 billion riyals in March, the data showed.  “ Saudi Arabia  exports huge amount of petrochemical and
plastics as raw materials but we still import many of them after
they are processed abroad to be used by local producers to make
other goods,” Abdul-Rahman al-Zamil, the head of the Export
Development Center, said today in a telephone interview. The
Riyadh-based center promotes the nation’s non-oil exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
