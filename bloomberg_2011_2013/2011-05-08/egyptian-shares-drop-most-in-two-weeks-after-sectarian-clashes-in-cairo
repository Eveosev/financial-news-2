Egyptian shares tumbled to the lowest
level in more than two years, led by EFG-Hermes Holding SAE,
after clashes between Muslims and Christians in Cairo killed at
least nine people.  The yields on the Ministry of Finance’s treasury bill sale
rose to the highest in more than two years. EFG-Hermes, the
country’s biggest publicly traded investment bank, declined the
most in almost two weeks.The  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  retreated 1.2 percent
to 4,878.41, the lowest level since April 2009, at the 2:30 p.m.
close in Cairo. The measure has plunged 32 percent this year as
a popular revolt led to the ouster of President  Hosni Mubarak  in
February.  “The sectarian conflict over the weekend in Cairo is the
main cause behind the overly exaggerated panic today,” said
Omar Darwish, equity sales trader at Cairo-based Commercial
International Brokerage Co.  Six Muslims and three Coptic Christians were killed during
the unrest, the state-run Middle East News Agency said today,
citing health officials. The army was later deployed on city
streets to stop the violence sparked by reports of a romance
between a Coptic Christian and a Muslim, Al Jazeera television
reported. Prime Minister Essam Sharaf canceled a trip to Bahrain
and the  United Arab Emirates  because of the violence.  Yields Increase  EFG-Hermes fell 4.9 percent, the biggest decline since
April 26, to 17.58 Egyptian pounds. Citadel Capital SAE, an
Egyptian private equity firm, tumbled the most in three weeks,
dropping 5.7 percent to 4.50 pounds.  The average yield on 91-day treasury bills rose to 11.564
percent today, the highest since January 2009, while the yield
on the 266-day securities climbed 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, 12.762 percent.  Egypt  sold a combined 5
billion pounds ($841 million) in t-bills at today’s auction.  The yield on Egypt’s 5.75 percent dollar bond maturing in
April 2020 was little changed at 6.28 percent and the pound was
also little changed at 5.942 per dollar on May 6.  To contact the reporter on this story:
