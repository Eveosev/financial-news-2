Lucas Glover claimed his first U.S.
PGA Tour victory since the 2009  U.S. Open , beating former
Clemson University golf teammate Jonathan Byrd in a playoff at
the Wells Fargo Championship.  Byrd mis hit a chip shot and bogeyed the first playoff hole
yesterday at Quail Hollow Club in Charlotte,  North Carolina ,
while Glover made par to take the $1.2 million winner’s check.  “I’m absolutely elated, especially here,” Glover, 31,
said at a news conference. “Against this field, on this course
and in a tournament of this magnitude, I’m thrilled.”  Glover and Byrd were tied at 15-under par through 72 holes,
one shot better than Rory Sabbatini.  Byrd made a 14-foot birdie putt on the last hole of the
final round to force the  PGA Tour ’s third straight playoff. He
then bogeyed the same hole, the par-4 18th, as Glover claimed
his third career PGA Tour win.  The PGA Tour now moves to  Ponte Vedra Beach , Florida, for
its flagship event, the $9.5 million Players Championship, which
is scheduled for May 12-15 at the TPC Sawgrass.  To contact the reporter on this story:
