New banking regulations in Switzerland
should take into account rules that other countries are defining
to avoid penalizing the nation’s banks, the  UBS AG (UBSN)  chairman and
chief executive officer for Europe, Middle East and Africa told
Il Sole 24 Ore.  The debate over the too-big-to-fail concept in Switzerland
doesn’t have to be hurried or emotional, UBS’s  Sergio Ermotti 
said in an interview with the newspaper.  After cutting risks, strengthening capital and reshuffling
management, UBS returned to profitability and recorded two
quarters of positive net inflows, he told Il Sole.  To contact the reporter on this story:
