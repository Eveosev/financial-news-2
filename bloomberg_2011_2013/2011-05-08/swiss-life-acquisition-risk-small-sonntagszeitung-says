Swiss Life Holding AG (SLHN)  Chief Executive
Officer Bruno Pfister said the company has a “relatively
small” chance of being acquired and the idea of a bid from
 Allianz SE (ALV)  is “completely baseless,” SonntagsZeitung reported.  While the insurer has “created the conditions” to remain
independent, the question of a sale must be posed over the
medium to long term if the company fails to deliver on its
plans, Pfister said in an interview in today’s  newspaper .  To contact the reporter on this story:
