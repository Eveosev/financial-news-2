Soybeans rose in  Chicago  for the
first time this week on signs demand has yet to slow even after
the worst U.S. drought in a half century lifted prices to a
record last month. Corn and wheat gained.  U.S. processors crushed 137.4 million bushels of soybeans
in July, up 2.4 percent from June, the National Oilseed
Processors Association said yesterday. The amount of soybeans
inspected for export surged 22 percent in the week ended Aug. 9,
government data show. The oilseed is up 34 percent this year as
dry weather left U.S. crops in the worst shape since 1988, after
drought slashed supplies in  South America  last season.  “We maintain a bullish outlook for soybeans,” Australia &
New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. analysts including  Paul Deane 
wrote today in an e-mailed report. “The market needs to ration
a record amount of supply before the next South American crop.”  Soybeans for November delivery rose 0.8 percent to $16.105
a bushel on the Chicago Board of Trade by 12:54 p.m. London
time. Prices fell 2.8 percent in the previous two days and are
down 4.8 percent since reaching a record $16.915 on July 23.  Areas of central  Iowa  and  Illinois  have chances of rain
tomorrow before conditions turn drier, National Weather Service
data show. Much of those states, the biggest U.S. corn and
soybean growers, had less than half the normal amount of rain in
the past 60 days.  Corn Advances  Corn for December delivery rose 0.6 percent to $7.94 a
bushel after sliding 4.2 percent in the previous three sessions.
The grain touched a record $8.49 on Aug. 10 after the Department
of Agriculture slashed its outlook for U.S. production to a six-
year low.  China , the world’s largest corn grower after the U.S., cut
its harvest estimate by about 500,000 metric tons after
armyworms damaged crops, state-owned researcher China National
Grain & Oils Information Center said today.  Wheat for December delivery gained 0.9 percent to $8.6575 a
bushel after tumbling 7.4 percent in the past three sessions. In
Paris, November-delivery milling wheat advanced 0.7 percent to
256.75 euros ($315.31) a ton on NYSE Liffe.  Egypt , the world’s largest wheat importer, bought 60,000
tons of Russian milling wheat at $313 a ton and an equal amount
of Ukrainian grain at $313.88 a ton, the  General Authority  for
Supply Commodities said yesterday. Algeria is seeking to buy
50,000 tons of soft wheat of optional origin, Paris-based farm
adviser Agritel said yesterday.  In  Russia , the world’s third-largest wheat exporter last
season, drought affected about 5.6 million hectares (13.8
million acres) of land planted with grains and other crops,
causing damage to agriculture that reached 36.5 billion rubles
($1.2 billion), the  Agriculture Ministry  said yesterday.  Importers tendered for wheat “as the market became
concerned with rising grain prices and the lower export volume
out of the  Black Sea ,” Eric Bailon, president of Manila-based
Paritas Trading Corp., said in a report.  To contact the reporters on this story:
