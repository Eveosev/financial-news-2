U.S. stock futures retreated after a
Federal Reserve report showed manufacturing in the  New York  area
unexpectedly contracted, fueling concern the economic recovery
is slowing.  Futures on the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index expiring in
September lost 0.2 percent to 1,398.90 at 8:32 a.m. in New York.  The Fed Bank of New York’s general economic index fell to
minus 5.9 this month from 7.4 in July. The median estimate in a
survey of Bloomberg economists was 7.0. Readings less than zero
signal contraction in the so-called Empire State Index, which
covers New York, northern  New Jersey  and southern  Connecticut .  The  S&P 500  has fluctuated around 1,400 for the past six
trading sessions, closing yesterday at 1,403.93. The index has
rebounded almost 10 percent from a five-month low on June 1.   U.S. equity volume this week reached the lowest level since
at least 2008 excluding holidays and volatility slid to a five-
year low as vacationing traders awaited policy clues from the
 Federal Reserve ’s summit at the end of the month.  About 4.5 billion shares changed hands on all venues on
Aug. 13, the lowest level in data compiled by Bloomberg going
back four years that excludes the days surrounding New Year’s,
Christmas, Thanksgiving and Independence Day. Volume was about
5.2 billion shares yesterday, still about 22 percent below the
average level of the year.   The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, lost 7.1 percent to 13.70 on Aug. 13, the lowest
level since June 2007. The VIX rebounded 8.4 percent to 14.85
yesterday.    To contact the editor responsible for this story:
