Frans Steyn returns to the lineup to
make his 50th Test appearance for  South Africa  in this weekend’s
Rugby Championship game against Argentina.  Steyn will start at inside center when the Springboks open
the annual southern hemisphere championship Aug. 18 at Newlands
stadium in  Cape Town . The 25-year-old, who missed the team’s
last match against  England  in June for his wedding, is the 23rd
player to reach 50 caps for South Africa.  Steyn’s return is one of five changes made by coach Heyneke Meyer from the England match.  Lwazi Mvovo starts for injured JP Pietersen at right wing,
Andreis Bekker replaces Juandre Kruger in the middle row and
Keegan Daniel starts at No. 8 for injured  Pierre Spies . Willem
Alberts takes over for Jacques Potgieter at flank and Zane
Kirchner returns at fullback for Gio Aplon.
