The cost of insuring Asia-Pacific
corporate and sovereign bonds from non-payment fell, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The  Markit iTraxx Asia  index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside  Japan  decreased 1 basis point to 148 as of
8:49 a.m. in  Hong Kong , Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc prices
show. The gauge decreased 10 basis points this month, according
to data provider CMA.  The  Markit iTraxx Australia  index dropped 1 basis point to
156 as of 10:42 a.m. in Sydney,  National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) 
prices show. The measure has also declined about 10 basis points
this month, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill Cos.
and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately
negotiated market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 184.5
as of 9:25 a.m. in Tokyo, Citigroup Inc. prices show. The
benchmark has traded this month between 207 and 184.2, where it
closed yesterday, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
