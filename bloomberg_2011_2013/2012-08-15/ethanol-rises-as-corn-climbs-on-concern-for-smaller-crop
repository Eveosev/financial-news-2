Ethanol futures increased a second
day on concern that the government’s estimate for damage to the
corn crop may be too modest after the most severe U.S. drought
in 56 years parched fields.  Prices followed corn higher on speculation the Agriculture
Department underestimated the crop damage that led it to reduce
its harvest projection on Aug. 10 by 13 percent to a six-year
low of 10.78 billion bushels this year. The agency forecast that
4.5 billion bushels will go toward ethanol production.  “Corn’s up so there’s some buying in ethanol,” said Jim Damask, a manager at Biofuelsconnect, a Heathrow, Florida-based
alternative energy broker.  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 1.3 cents,
or 0.5 percent, to settle at $2.589 a gallon on the  Chicago 
Board of Trade. Prices have gained 18 percent this year.  A supply glut is placing a ceiling on how much prices can
gain, Damask said.  Stockpiles fell 1.1 percent to 18.4 million barrels in the
week ended Aug. 10, Energy Department data show, 4.9 percent
higher than a year ago.  In cash market trading, ethanol in  New York  gained 2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.64 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
rose 1.5 cents, or 0.6 percent, to $2.565, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf advanced 1.5 cents, or 0.6
percent, to $2.625 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel
added 0.5 cent to $2.755.  Corn for December delivery jumped 15 cents, or 1.9 percent,
to $8.04 a bushel in Chicago. One bushel makes at least 2.75
gallons of ethanol.  To contact the reporter on this story:
