Elon Musk,  Tesla Motors Inc. (TSLA) ’s chief
executive officer and co-founder, was granted an option to buy
5.27 million shares as part of a long-term compensation plan to
keep him at the maker of luxury electric cars .  Musk, already the  largest stockholder  of  Palo Alto ,
California-based Tesla with a 25.8 percent stake, can exercise
the option at a price of $31.17 a share, according to a
regulatory filing yesterday. The option, granted Aug. 13, has a
10-year term and vests in 10 equal installments based on the
company meeting certain milestones, according to the filing.  The stock option is the first since Dec. 4, 2009, for Musk,
Tesla said in an Aug. 2 filing. He currently has an annual base
salary of $33,280, according to that filing. Musk, 41, also
leads aerospace company Space Exploration Technologies Corp. and
is chairman of solar panel installer Solarcity Corp.  “From a financial perspective, these options aren’t going
to change the way he looks at things,” said Alan Baum,
principal of auto-industry forecaster Baum & Associates in West
Bloomfield,  Michigan . “He started his companies because these
are his interests. He’s obviously very invested in them
financially, emotionally and socially.”  Tesla is ramping up production of battery-powered Model S
sedans at its Fremont, California, plant with a goal of
delivering 5,000 this year and 20,000 in 2013. Musk, who is also
chairman of the company named for inventor  Nikola Tesla , expects
Tesla to report its first profitable quarters next year.  Goals for Musk’s options to vest fully include Tesla’s
market capitalization, now $3.2 billion, reaching $43.5 billion;
development and production of the Model X sport-utility vehicle
and lower-priced “Gen III” electric car; gross margin of 30
percent or more for four consecutive quarters; and aggregate
production of 300,000 vehicles, according to the Aug. 2 filing.  The company’s long-term market capitalization target looks
“somewhat difficult,” given its size, Baum said.  Tesla rose 3.1 percent to $30.30 at the close in  New York .
The  shares  have gained 6.1 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
