(Corrects percentage decline in first paragraph.)  ATP Oil and Gas Inc., the offshore
oil explorer that lost 94 percent of its market value this year,
canceled a scheduled presentation at a Denver energy conference
today.  Enercom Consulting, organizer of The Oil & Gas Conference,
confirmed the cancellation by Houston-based ATP.  ATP, which faces an $89 million interest payment in
November, has been punished by investors after missing
production targets and failing to start projects on time.
