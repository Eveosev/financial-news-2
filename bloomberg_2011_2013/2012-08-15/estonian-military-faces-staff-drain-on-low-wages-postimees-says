Estoniaâ€™s senior military personnel
is increasingly leaving for private-industry jobs as a result of
rising income disparities,  Postimees  reported, citing data and
interviews with former military officers.  Almost 400 officers resigned last year, the most since at
least 2006, according to the Tallinn-based newspaper. The
government has no funds to raise military wages until next year,
Defense Minister Urmas Reinsalu was cited as saying by
Postimees.  To contact the reporter on this story:
