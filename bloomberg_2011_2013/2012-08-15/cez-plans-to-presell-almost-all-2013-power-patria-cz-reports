CEZ AS (CEZ)  plans to presell almost all
its 2013 power production by the end of the year, which is a
“standard” pace, as it doesn’t expect any “significant”
changes of electricity prices in the near term, Chief Financial
Officer Martin Novak told  Patria.cz  in an interview.  The biggest impulse for a shift of prices would be a
revision of parameters for trading with emission allowances on
the European Union level, Novak told Patria.cz. The timing of
this step is uncertain and it’s not clear whether this revision
would happen at all, Novak told Patria.  The company plans to keep its dividend payout ratio and is
“definitely” not considering a share buyback because of its
“extensive” investment plan and the intention to build new
units at Temelin nuclear plant, Novak told Patria.  To contact the reporter on this story:
