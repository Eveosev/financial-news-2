The  Federal Reserve  and five other
federal financial regulatory agencies proposed new appraisal
requirements for higher-risk mortgage loans as part of the
financial system overhauls required under the Dodd-Frank Act.  The rule would require lenders for those mortgages to use
certified appraisers who prepare written reports based on a
physical inspection of the home, the Fed said in a statement
today. The agencies also proposed requiring creditors to
disclose the purpose of the appraisal to applicants and give
them free copies of the reports.  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, mortgage loans are considered
higher-risk if they’re backed by the borrower’s home and have
 interest rates  above a certain level. The Fed is seeking
comments on the rules, which it is proposing jointly with the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.,  Federal Housing Finance Agency , National Credit Union
Administration and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
