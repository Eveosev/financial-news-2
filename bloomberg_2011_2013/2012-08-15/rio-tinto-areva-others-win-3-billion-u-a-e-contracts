The  Emirates Nuclear Energy Corp. ,
the company developing nuclear power in the  United Arab
Emirates , awarded fuel supply contracts worth about $3 billion.  Rio Tinto  Plc and  Uranium One Inc. (UUU)  will supply natural
uranium, and Urenco Ltd. will provide enrichment services,
Emirates Nuclear said in an e-mailed statement today. ConverDyn
will provide conversion services, according to the statement.  Rosatom Corp.’s nuclear fuel trader OAO Techsnabexport,
also known as Tenex, and  Areva SA (AREVA)  will supply uranium
concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services,
according to the statement.  Emirates Nuclear “expects to return to the market at
various times to take advantage of favorable market conditions
and to strengthen its security of supply position,” it said in
the statement.  The U.A.E is aiming to be the first Gulf Arab nation to
develop nuclear power, with the first of four 1,400 megawatt
reactors scheduled to start operating in 2017.  Korea Electric
Power Corp. (KEP)  was awarded the contract to build the plants in
2009. A joint venture between ENEC, as the local developer is
known, and Korea Electric will operate the units under that
deal.  The contracted fuel will enable the Barakah facility in Abu
Dhabi’s Western Region to generate up to 450 million megawatt-
hours for a period of 15 years starting in 2017, the statement
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
