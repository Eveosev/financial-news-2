Japan’s bonds fell, with the
benchmark rate climbing to a six-week high, as domestic
 government securities  followed declines in U.S. debt yesterday
and today ahead of U.S. data on inflation.  The benchmark 10-year yield rose three basis points, or
0.03 percentage point, to 0.82 percent in  Tokyo , according to
Japan Bond Trading Co., the nation’s largest interdealer debt
broker. That was the highest level since July 4 and the biggest
increase in a week. The five-year rate increased two basis
points to 0.215 percent, the highest since July 2.  Ten-year Treasury yields rose four basis points to 1.78
percent in  London , and reached 1.79 percent the highest since
May 22, according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. That followed a
seven basis point jump yesterday.  Gains in the U.S. consumer price index slowed to 1.6
percent in July compared with a year earlier, from 1.7 percent
in June, according to a Bloomberg News survey of economists
before the Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in  Washington .
Prices rose 0.2 percent in July from June, the survey shows, the
first advance since March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
