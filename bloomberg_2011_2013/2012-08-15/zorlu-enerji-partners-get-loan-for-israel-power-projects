Zorlu Enerji Elektrik Uretim AS (ZOREN) , an
electricity producer in  Turkey , and its partner Edeltech Ltd. of
Israel signed a 1.1 billion-shekel ($273 million) loan accord
today with  Bank Leumi Le-Israel Ltd. (LUMI)  to finance two plant
projects in the Jewish state.  Repayments on the loan, which has a maturity of 18 years
and annual interest of 5.75 percent, will start after the
natural gas-fired plants are completed in the second half of
2014, Zorlu said in a statement to the  Istanbul Stock Exchange 
today. The companies will meet 20 percent of the investment from
their equity, it said.  “Zorlu Holding has investments exceeding $1 billion in
Israel,” Ahmet Nazif Zorlu, chairman of Zorlu Holding, said in
an e-mailed statement.  The Ramat Negev power plant, which will have a capacity of
120 megawatts, will cost 766 million shekels and the 55-megawatt
Ashdod will be built for 355 million shekels, according to the
statement. M+W  Israel  Ltd. will plan and build the plants while
Zorlu O&M Enerji Tesisleri Isletme & Bakim AS will operate them
and provide maintenance.  Zorlu Enerji Elektrik cut its stakes in Ramat Negev Energy
Ltd. and Ashdod Energy Ltd. to 42 percent each from 51 percent
last week while Edeltech’s stake rose to 58 percent in each
company, Zorlu said on Aug. 7. In return, Zorlu raised its stake
in Solad Energy Ltd., which is building a 100-megawatt power
plant in Israel, to 42 percent from 26 percent as Edeltech cut
its stake.  Dorad gas-fired power plant project, Zorlu Enerji
Elektrik’s biggest investment in Israel with an 800-megawatt
capacity, is programmed to start operations next year, the
company said.  Zorlu Enerji rose 0.9 percent to 1.12 liras at the 5:40
p.m. close in Istanbul, the biggest increase since Aug. 3. The
main market index gained 0.7 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
