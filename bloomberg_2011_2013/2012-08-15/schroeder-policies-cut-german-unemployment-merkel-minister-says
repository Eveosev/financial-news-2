Former German Chancellor  Gerhard Schroeder ’s policies helped cut unemployment in half since they
were started 10 years ago, German Christian Democratic Union
Labor Minister Ursula von der Leyen told N-TV television.  “The bottom line is that the labor-market reforms paid
off” even though the Social Democrat Schroeder was defeated by
CDU leader  Angela Merkel  in 2005, von der Leyen said. “The idea
was that everybody must have a chance to find work and we’re
making sure there is work.”  Schroeder quit as SPD leader in 2004 while remaining
chancellor amid growing tensions in the party over his labor
market changes that cut benefits for the long-term unemployed
and raised pressure on job seekers to accept available work even
if they were qualified to take better-paid jobs.  Merkel ruled from 2005 to 2009 with the SPD as her junior
coalition partner. Since 2009, she’s been in coalition with the
pro-business Free Democratic Party. If elections were held now,
Merkel would again have to rely on a coalition with the SPD,
according to a Forsa poll for RTL television published today.  Support for Merkel’s CDU and its Christian Social Union
Bavarian sister party held at 36 percent while her FDP coalition
partner fell one point to 4 percent. That’s below the 5 percent
threshold needed to win seats in parliament under German
election law. The FDP won 14.6 percent in the 2009 election.  The Social Democrats held at 26 percent and the opposition
Green party, the SPD’s ally under Schroeder, was unchanged at 13
percent. The Left party rose 1 percentage point to 7 percent and
support for the Pirate Party, which isn’t represented in
parliament, held at 9 percent.  Forsa surveyed 2,501 people from Aug. 6-10 for the poll.
The margin of error is a much as 2.5 percentage points.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
