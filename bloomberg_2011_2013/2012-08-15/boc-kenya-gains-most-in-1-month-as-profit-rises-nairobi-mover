BOC Kenya Ltd., (BOCK)  a supplier of
industrial and medical gases, gained the most in a month after
saying first-half profit climbed 57 percent.  Shares rose 1.8 percent to 112 shillings by 11:15 a.m. in
the capital Nairobi, the biggest rally since July 16.  BOC, a unit of Linde AG, said yesterday net income jumped
to 82.9 million shillings ($987,000) in the six months ended
June 30. The company declared an interim dividend of 2 shillings
a share. Growth in profit was due to “an improved economic
climate, input cost stability together with the restructuring
actions implemented in 2010 and 2011,” BOC said.  “The results were quite good,” Eric Musau, a research
analyst at Nairobi-based Standard Investment Bank Ltd. said in a
phone interview today. “Over the last two years they have been
doing a bit of re-structuring and they seem to have benefited
from it because operating margins improved and costs are under
control.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
