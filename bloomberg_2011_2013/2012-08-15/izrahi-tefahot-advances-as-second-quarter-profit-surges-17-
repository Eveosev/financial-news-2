Mizrahi Tefahot Bank Ltd. (MZTF)  advanced
to the highest level in almost a week after Israelâ€™s fourth-
largest bank by assets reported a 17 percent increase in second-
quarter profit and provisions for bad debt declined.  The  shares  rose 1.8 percent to 30.77 shekels, the highest
level since Aug. 9, at the close in Tel Aviv. The benchmark
TA-25 Index was little changed.  Mizrahi Tefahot said second-quarter net income rose to 295
million shekels ($73 million) from 252 million shekels a year
earlier, while bad debt provisions dropped to 45 million shekels
from 80 million shekels.  Bank Hapoalim Ltd. (POLI) , Bank Leumi Le-
Israel Ltd. and  Israel Discount Bank Ltd. (DSCT)  are scheduled to
report their results on Aug. 30, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
