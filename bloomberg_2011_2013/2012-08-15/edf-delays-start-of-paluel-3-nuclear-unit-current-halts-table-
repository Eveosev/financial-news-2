Electricite de  France  SA delayed the
start of its Paluel-3 nuclear power plant by one day, according
to data on the website of French grid operator Reseau de
Transport d’Electricite.  The world’s biggest nuclear power plant operator has 37
French reactors online, representing 64 percent of the country’s
available nuclear capacity, RTE data show. That’s the lowest
since June 20. EDF’s 58 atomic plants generate about 78 percent
of France’s power.  The table below lists EDF’s nuclear units that are out of
 service , their generating capacity in megawatts, when they
stopped and the expected return date, if known, according to
RTE.  To contact the reporter on this story:
