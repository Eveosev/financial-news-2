Nibe Industrier AB (NIBEB) , a Swedish
heating-technology company, rose the most since 2009 after
second-quarter sales and net income beat analysts’ estimates.  Nibe  rose  as much as 7.25 kronor, or 7.5 percent, to 103.75
kronor, its biggest intraday jump since Feb. 13 2009, making it
the third-biggest gainer on the  Stockholm OMX All Share Index. (SAX) 
Shares traded 6 percent higher at 102.25 kronor as at 4:06 p.m.
local time, valuing the company at 11.3 billion kronor ($1.68
billion).  Sales rose to 2.32 billion kronor in the second quarter
from 1.62 billion kronor a year earlier, slightly beating the
average estimate of 2.3 billion kronor, the Markaryd, Sweden-
based company said in a statement today. Net income rose 73
percent to 180 million kronor, exceeding the 155-million kronor
estimate according to a  survey  compiled by Bloomberg.  “High  oil prices  and signs of some optimism in various
parts of the world encourage us to remain cautiously positive
about the prospects for 2012,” Chief Executive Officer Gerteric Lindquist said in the statement. “In terms of markets, most of
our exposure is towards countries with strong economies,” he
said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
