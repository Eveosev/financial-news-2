Sprint Nextel Corp. (S) , the third-
largest U.S. wireless carrier, rose to its highest level since
July 2011 amid growing optimism the company can revive sluggish
sales and return to profitability.  The stock climbed 8 percent to $5.39 at the close in New
York. Shares of Overland Park, Kansas-based Sprint have more
than doubled this year.  Sprint, which ranks behind  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T Inc. (T) 
in U.S. wireless customers, is benefiting from higher average
phone bills, partly because more customers are using smartphones
like the iPhones to download data. The company is phasing out
its outdated Nextel network and expanding the reach of LTE
service -- a technology that offers speedier downloads.  Some investors also are betting that there may be
consolidation in the wireless business, with Sprint snapping up
other companies, said Kevin Smithen, an analyst at Macquarie
Capital USA Inc. in New York.  “Sprint has been boosted by several things,” Smithen said
in an interview. “There’s also a sense that they will lead the
eventual consolidation of the smaller players like MetroPCS and
Leap, which will help them with deleveraging and also eliminate
some of the competition.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
