Nigeria’s naira gained to the
strongest in more than nine months as lenders sold dollars to
comply with central  bank regulations  on foreign-exchange
holdings.  The currency of Africa’s biggest oil producer climbed as
much as 1 percent to 156.900 a dollar, the highest on a closing
basis since Nov. 3, 2011. It traded at 157.050 as of 3:47 p.m.
in Lagos, the commercial capital.  “The naira was supported by sales by banks trying to meet
latest stipulated dollar holdings,” Wale Abe, chief executive
of the Lagos-based Financial Markets Dealers Association, said
by phone today. “The latest  central bank  decisions have made it
difficult for banks to hold dollars for speculation, a
development that has supported the naira.”  The  Central Bank of Nigeria  reduced the amount of foreign
exchange banks can hold as a percentage of their shareholders’
funds to 1 percent from 3 percent and increased their  reserve
requirements  to 12 percent of total assets from 8 percent. The
regulator sold $126.8 million at a foreign-currency auction
today at 155.80 naira, the Abuja-based bank said in an e-mailed
statement.  “There was also unconfirmed report of dollar sales by an
 oil company ,” Tunde Ladipo, chief executive officer of Lagos-
based Valuechain Investment Ltd., which trades currencies, said
by phone. The oil industry is the second major supplier of the
US currency after the central bank.  Yields on the West African nation’s 16 percent domestic
debt due 2019 rose two basis points, or 0.2 percentage point, to
16.52 percent, according to yesterday’s prices on the Financial
Markets Dealers Association website. Borrowing costs on the West
African nation’s $500 million of Eurobonds due 2021 fell
thirteen basis points to 5.008 percent today.  Ghana ’s cedi gained for a fourth day, adding 0.5 percent to
1.9422 per dollar in Accra, its strongest since July 4.  To contact the reporter on this story:
