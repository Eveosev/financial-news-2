Philadelphia 76ers center  Andrew
Bynum  will have the same non-surgical knee procedure as Kobe Bryant,  Grant Hill  and  Alex Rodriguez , the Philadelphia Inquirer
reported, citing a person familiar with the plan.  Bynum, 24, who is being introduced today to 76ers fans, is
slated to go to Germany next month for the procedure to treat
osteoarthritis, the Inquirer said.  Peter Wehling, founder of the Center for Molecular
Orthopaedics in Düsseldorf, uses the patient’s blood to produce
a high concentration of anti-inflammatory proteins that are
injected into the joint, the newspaper said.  Bynum dislocated his left knee cap in January of the 2007-
08 season and four months later underwent arthroscopic surgery,
the Inquirer said. He also had surgery on his right knee
following the 2009-10 season.  Bynum, who is playing pain-free, is coming off his best
season of his seven-year National Basketball Association career
averaging 18.7 points and 11.8 rebounds in 60 games during the
shortened season, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
