Russia , which started exporting
sugar last season, is producing the sweetener from domestically
grown beets at a faster pace this month compared to a year
earlier, according to the country’s Sugar Producers’ Union.  Sugar output from sugar-beets reached 23,500 metric tons in
the first eight days of the season that started Aug. 1, the
 Agriculture Ministry  said in a document, citing union data, on
the government’s website. That’s up from 13,000 tons a year
earlier, according to the union data.  Russia had a record season in 2011-12 with a sugar-beet
crop of 46.2 million tons producing 5.1 million tons of beet
sugar, according to Agriculture Ministry data. It shipped
300,000 tons of sweetener last season, according to the ministry
data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
