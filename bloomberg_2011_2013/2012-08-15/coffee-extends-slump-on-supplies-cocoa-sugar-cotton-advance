Arabica-coffee futures fell, heading
for the longest slump in six months, on persistent signs that
supplies will remain ample. Cocoa, sugar, cotton and orange
juice advanced.  Stockpiles of coffee at warehouses monitored by ICE Futures
U.S. rose 0.1 percent yesterday, taking this month’s climb to 4
percent and the inventories to the highest level since October
2010, exchange data showed. Dry weather in  Brazil , the world’s
largest producer, has allowed the harvest to accelerate in the
main growing areas according to Cooperativa Regional de
Cafeicultores em Guaxupe Ltda, the biggest coffee cooperative.  “The rising stocks are a psychological bearish factor,”
Joe Scaduto, the president of JPS Commodities LLC, a broker in
New York, said in a telephone interview. “Brazil’s weather is
also good for the crop.”  Arabica-coffee futures for December delivery dropped 2.4
percent to $1.62205 a pound at 11:08 a.m. on ICE in New York,
after reaching $1.618, the lowest for a most-active contract
since June 28. A close at that level will mark the seventh
straight loss, the longest decline since Feb. 16.  Cocoa futures for December delivery increased 0.4 percent
to $2,450 a metric ton on ICE.  Also in  New York , raw-sugar futures advanced 0.3 percent to
20.39 cents a pound, heading for the first gain in 12 sessions.
Cotton futures for December delivery climbed 0.2 percent to
72.25 cents a pound.  Orange-juice futures for November delivery rose 1.2 percent
to $1.0575 a pound, headed for the first gain since Aug. 8.  To contact the reporter on this story:
