Thailand , Indonesia and Malaysia,
representing about 70 percent of global natural-rubber supply,
agreed steps to boost prices, said Yium Tavarolit, chief
secretary of the International Rubber Consortium Ltd.  The measures will be announced by ministers tomorrow, said
Yium, who declined to give details. Global supply and demand for
natural rubber is in balance, with no surplus, he said in an
interview after a one-day meeting in Bangkok. State agencies
from the three countries and an exporter representative from
Thailand participated.  Rubber plunged 43 percent in the past year and reached the
lowest in almost three years as growth slowed in  China , the top
consumer, and  Europe . Demand in China may drop 5 percent this
year as declining truck sales cut tire use, Hangzhou Zhongce
Rubber Co., the biggest tiremaker, said last month. The three
producers cut exports by 690,000 metric tons from January to
July 2009 to combat a 56 percent decline in prices a year
earlier. Rubber surged 103 percent in 2009.  The steps “will have a positive outcome, moving prices
higher,” said Yium. China’s imports are still growing, he said.
The International Rubber Consortium is an arm of the
International Tripartite Rubber Council, which represents
growers and exporters from the three countries.  January-delivery rubber gained 0.9 percent to close at
209.5 yen a kilogram ($2,654 a metric ton) on the  Tokyo 
Commodity Exchange after settling yesterday at the lowest level
for the most-active contract since October 2009.  Building Stockpiles  Thailand, the top shipper, may raise the budget to buy
rubber sheets from local farmers above market rates from the
current allocation of 15 billion baht ($476 million) and
increase locations for purchases to cover all growing regions,
Deputy Farm Minister  Nattawut Saikuar  said earlier. The plan
will be presented for cabinet approval on Aug. 21, he said.  While Thailand is building inventories and cutting aging
trees, local  rates  have fallen 33 percent from this year’s peak
to the lowest level since November 2009. The country announced
in May plans to buy more than 10,000 tons in Tokyo and  Shanghai 
to boost prices.  Global natural-rubber consumption may rise 2.5 percent to
11.2 million tons in 2012 as output grows 3.2 percent to 11.3
million tons, the International Rubber Study Group said last
month. Demand may climb 4.3 percent to 11.7 million tons next
year as production gains 4.4 percent to 11.8 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
