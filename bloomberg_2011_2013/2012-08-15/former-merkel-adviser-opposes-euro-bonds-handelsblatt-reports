Beatrice Weder di Mauro, an
economics professor at the University of Mainz and former
adviser to the German government, said in a guest commentary in
the Handelsblatt newspaper that euro bonds are not necessary to
solve  Europe ’s debt crisis.  Euro-zone rules shouldn’t allow the 17 members of the
currency bloc to issue common debt, Weder di Mauro writes in
today’s edition. A better solution is to introduce an insolvency
and restructuring mechanism for banks and sovereigns, and bridge
financing with time limits and conditions attached, she said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
