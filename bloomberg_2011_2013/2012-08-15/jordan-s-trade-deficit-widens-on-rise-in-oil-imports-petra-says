Jordan’s trade deficit widened 23
percent in the first half from a year earlier, because of an
increase in oil imports and a decline in exports, the official
Petra news agency reported.  The deficit reached 4.66 billion dinars ($6.6 billion),
compared with 3.78 billion dinars at the end of June 2011,
according to Petra.  To contact the reporter on this story:
