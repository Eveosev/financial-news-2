Bolton Wanderers midfielder Fabrice
Muamba retired from soccer after his near-death experience in a
match last season, the English team said.  The player collapsed on the field during a televised F.A.
Cup quarterfinal at Tottenham on March 17, and was revived after
his heart stopped for more than an hour. He was released from
the hospital a month later.  “As part of my ongoing recovery, last week I traveled to
 Belgium  to seek further medical advice from a leading
cardiologist,” Muamba, 24, said today in a statement on
Bolton’s website. “But the news I received was obviously not
what I had hoped it would be and it means I am now announcing my
retirement from professional football.”  Last season was his fourth with Bolton. He had also played
for Birmingham and Arsenal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
