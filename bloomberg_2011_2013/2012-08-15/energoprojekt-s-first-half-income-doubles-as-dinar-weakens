--  Energoprojekt Holding AD (ENHL) , a
Serbian construction and energy company, said first-half profit
more than doubled, helped by a weaker dinar.  Net income rose to 522 million dinars ($5.5 million) from
260 million dinars a year earlier, the Belgrade-based group said
in a statement to the  Belgrade Stock Exchange . The dinar
depreciated 10.6 percent over the period.  The company  operates  in 19 countries in businesses from
highway, rail and building construction, to consulting, energy
and information technology.  To contact the reporter on this story:
