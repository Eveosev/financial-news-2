Following are comments from Robert O. Blake, U.S. Assistant Secretary for South and Central Asian
affairs, on a proposed  gas pipeline  from  Turkmenistan  to India.  A road show on the project is scheduled for next month in
the U.S. and other locations, Blake said today in Almaty.  On the project:  “There’s been good progress on what they called the gas
sale and purchase agreements between these countries.”  “The next real milestone will be a roadshow at which they
will begin to have concrete discussions who is going to form and
lead a consortium to actually build the pipeline.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
