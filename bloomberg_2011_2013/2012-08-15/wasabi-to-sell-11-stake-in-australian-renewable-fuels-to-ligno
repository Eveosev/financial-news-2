Wasabi Energy Ltd. (WAS) , an Australian
company investing in renewable energy, agreed to sell its 11
percent stake in  Australian Renewable Fuels Ltd. (ARW)  to Canadian
biofuels company  Lignol Energy Corp. (LEC)   Wasabi will sell 275 million shares in Australian
Renewables for C$4.30 million ($4.33 million) to Vancouver-based
Lignol, Wasabi said in a regulatory  statement  today. Prior to
the agreement, Wasabi was Australian Renewableâ€™s  largest 
shareholder.  The transaction includes C$500,000 in cash, 19 million
common shares of Lignol issued at C$0.08 a share and a 10-month
secured convertible debenture for C$2.25 million, Wasabi said.  Wasabi said in June that it was raising money to develop
projects and provide working capital. Wasabi owns the
intellectual property of the Kalina Cycle, which is used to
produce electricity from low heat sources. The technology can be
implemented in geothermal plants, oil refineries, cement plants,
steel and metal melting works.  To contact the reporter on this story:
