Clas Ohlson AB (CLASB) , a Swedish discount
hardware and electrical retailer, fell the most in six weeks
after its July sales growth failed to gain as much as analysts
expected.  Clas Ohlson fell as much as 3.6 percent and was 3.3 percent
lower at 101.25 kronor at 3:23 p.m. in Stockholm trading, the
biggest drop since June 1. The Stockholm OMX All-Share Index was
down 0.6 percent.  Clas Ohlson, which sells products ranging from nail
clippers to lawn mowers, is impacted by the broadly weak
consumer appetite in  Europe . The Insjon, Sweden-based company is
expanding into the U.K. to diversify its geographic Nordic
stronghold.  Sales in July rose 4 percent from the previous month to 526
million kronor ($78 million) and 5 percent compared with a year
earlier. Analysts expected growth of 10.8 percent, according to
a poll compiled by Direkt. The discount retailer said it had 162
stores opened as of July 31.  To contact the reporter on this story:
