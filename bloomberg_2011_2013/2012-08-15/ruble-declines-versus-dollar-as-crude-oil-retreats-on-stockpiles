The ruble weakened against the
dollar as investors speculated the  U.S. economy  is growing
enough for the  Federal Reserve  to avoid more stimulus.  The Russian currency slid 0.3 percent to 31.9160 versus the
dollar by the close in Moscow. Investors are betting the ruble
will fall further, with non-deliverable forwards showing the
currency at 32.4025 per dollar in three months, little changed
from yesterday. The currency rallied 0.2 percent to 39.1825 per
euro.  U.S. 10-year Treasury yields climbed to the highest level
in almost three months after a report today showed a pickup in
industrial output. Data yesterday indicated American retail
sales grew more than forecast. Oil,  Russia ’s main export earner,
advanced 0.3 percent to $93.70 a barrel in  New York .  “Investors expected that a possible stimulus could boost
stocks and commodities prices,” Maxim Korovin, a Moscow-based
analyst at VTB Capital said by phone. “As chances for the
stimulus fade, they are reducing appetite for risky assets,
including the Russian ruble.”  Russia’s currency was little changed at 35.1859 versus the
central bank’s target basket, which is made up of 55 percent
dollars and 45 percent euros.  Given the current oil price, it’s hard for the ruble to
weaken to more than 35.30 to 35.45 rubles versus the central
bank’s currency basket, VTB’s Korovin said. “This will be the
resistance level.”  Russia’s central bank on July 24 set a corridor for the
currency to fluctuate in between 31.65 to 38.65 rubles to the
dollar-euro basket.  The extra yield investors demand to own Russia’s dollar
bonds over  U.S. Treasuries  fell two basis points to 221,
according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global Index. Yields on
the government’s ruble bonds due April 2021 rose four basis
points to 7.87 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  To contact the reporters on this story:
