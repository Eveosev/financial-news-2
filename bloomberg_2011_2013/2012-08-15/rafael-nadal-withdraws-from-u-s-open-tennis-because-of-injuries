Eleven-time Grand Slam  Rafael Nadal 
won’t play in the  U.S. Open , skipping the tennis season’s final
major event because of injuries.  “I am very sad to announce that I am not ready to play the
US Open in NY,” Nadal, 26, said today in a Twitter post.
“Thanks to my fans for their support and specially, the new
yorkers.”  Tournament Director David Brewer said in a statement that
the 2010 champion from Spain “informed us that he will not be
ready to compete at the  U.S. Open  this year and has withdrawn
from the tournament.”  The U.S. Open begins on Aug. 27 at the National Tennis
Center in  New York .  Nadal, ranked No. 3 in the world, said on July 4 that he
had tendinitis in one of his knees. The announcement came the
week after he lost to No. 100-ranked Lukas Rosol in the second
round at Wimbledon.  Nadal hasn’t played since that loss. On July 19, he said
that he wasn’t fit enough to defend his Olympic title, calling
it “one of the saddest moments of my career.”  In June, Nadal, a left-hander, won his record seventh
 French Open , beating top-seeded Novak Djokovic of  Serbia  in four
sets. Nadal had lost the previous three Grand Slam finals to
Djokovic, including the 2011 U.S. Open.  Nadal was last atop the ATP World Tour rankings from June
2010 to June 2011. He beat Djokovic in the 2010 U.S. Open final
and also won the Australian Open in 2009 and Wimbledon in 2008
and 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
