Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4) , Brazil’s
largest company by market value, is working with Transocean Ltd.
to overturn a court order to suspend the drilling company’s
operations in the country.  Petrobras’s “legal team is working with Transocean,” Jose Formigli, the head of exploration and production at Petrobras,
told reporters in Rio de Janeiro today. “Transocean provides
eight drilling rigs to Petrobras and they are important.”  A Brazilian appeals court July 31 ordered Transocean and
 Chevron Corp. (CVX)  to suspend operations in Brazil as part of an
investigation into two oil spills in Chevron’s offshore Frade
field, in which Petrobras is a partner. Transocean is the owner
of the rig used by Chevron when the first, 300 barrel spill
occurred in November. The second spill occurred in March.  The appeals court gave Vernier, Switzerland-based
Transocean and San Ramon, California-based Chevron 30 days to
suspend their operations. The suspensions will last until the
federal prosecutor’s office, the oil regulator and environmental
agencies complete investigations into the spills, the court said
in its ruling.  To contact the reporter on this story:
