Gold advanced after a U.S. report
showing stagnant consumer prices bolstered prospects that the
 Federal Reserve  will take further steps to spur growth, reviving
inflation and demand for the metal as a hedge.  Consumer prices were unchanged in July and are up 1.4
percent over the past 12 months, the smallest year-to-year
increase since November 2010, the Labor Department reported
today. Gold has dropped 6.1 percent since the end of February as
the Fed failed to announce any new easing measures besides
extending its program in June of replacing short-term bonds with
longer-term debt by $267 billion through the end of 2012.  “The CPI numbers have removed one roadblock in the path of
some announcement on the easing front,”  David Meger , the
director of metal trading at Vision Financial Markets in
Chicago, said in a telephone interview.  Gold futures for December delivery advanced 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,606.60 an ounce at 1:39 p.m. on the Comex in New
York. Prices have risen 2.5 percent this year.  Bullion gained 0.8 percent last week amid speculation that
China, the U.S. and  Europe  may take more steps to boost economic
growth, reviving demand for gold as an inflation hedge.  The metal surged 70 percent from the end of December 2008
to June 2011 as the Fed kept borrowing costs at a record low and
bought $2.3 trillion of debt in two rounds of so-called
quantitative easing.  SPDR Investment  Soros Fund Management  more than doubled its investment in
the  SPDR Gold Trust (GLD) , an exchange-traded product backed by
bullion, to 884,400 shares as of June 30, compared with three
months earlier, a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing
showed yesterday. Paulson & Co., which owns the biggest stake in
SPDR, increased its holdings by 26 percent to 21.8 million
shares, a filing showed. Global holdings in bullion-backed ETPs
reached a record 2,417.3 metric tons on Aug. 10,  data  compiled
by Bloomberg show.  Silver futures for December delivery rose 0.2 percent to
$27.896 an ounce on the Comex.  On the  New York Mercantile Exchange , platinum futures for
October delivery fell 0.2 percent to $1,396.20 an ounce.
Palladium futures for September delivery slipped 0.1 percent to
$578.05 an ounce.  To contact the reporter on this story:
