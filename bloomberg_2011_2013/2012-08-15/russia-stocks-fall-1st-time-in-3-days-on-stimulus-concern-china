Russian stocks  retreated for the
first time in three days on speculation the U.S. won’t expand
stimulus and on concern  China  will struggle to sustain its pace
of growth.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 1 percent to 1,448.32 by the close in
Moscow. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s biggest oil producer, and OAO
Magnitogorsk Iron & Steel slid 1.9 percent and 2.1 percent
respectively.  The U.S. Federal Reserve will hold off from a third round
of bond-buying, known as quantitative easing, in September amid
better economic figures, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a
report. Metal companies led Chinese stocks lower after Vale SA,
the world’s biggest iron-ore producer said China’s “golden
years” are gone as economic growth decelerates.  “It remains the case that investors either want to see
indicators of an actual recovery or indications of policy moves
to reverse any signs of weakness,”  Chris Weafer , chief
strategist at Troika Dialog in Moscow, wrote in an e-mailed
report today. “The latter remain elusive, but the former, at
least in the U.S., provides enough to support a glimmer of
hope.”  The Micex trades at 5.4 times  estimated earnings . That
compares with a multiple of 10 times for the MSCI  Emerging
Markets  Index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
