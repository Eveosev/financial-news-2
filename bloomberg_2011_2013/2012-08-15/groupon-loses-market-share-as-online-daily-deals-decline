At  Groupon Inc. (GRPN) , daily deals are
fading. That’s the message the company sent many investors this
week when it reported a decline in gross billings, or the total
value of goods and services bought on its site, between the
first and second quarters of this year.  While demand for online coupons may be cooling off,
competition is rising, Bloomberg.com’s Tech Blog reported.
Groupon’s market  share  in  North America  shrank to 53 percent in
the second quarter, down from 56 percent the previous three
month period, according a report from daily-deal aggregator
Yipit. Meanwhile, LivingSocial Inc. grew its share to 22
percent, up from 20 percent.  “This was the first sizable shift backwards in well over a
year,” for Chicago-based Groupon, said Unaiz Kabani, product
manager for New York-based Yipit.  In North America, Groupon’s gross billings from daily deals
fell 2 percent in the period, Kabani said, while LivingSocial
grew 15 percent.  Paul Taaffe , a spokesman for Groupon, and Brendan Lewis, a
spokesman for LivingSocial, declined to comment.  Like Groupon, LivingSocial is looking to expand beyond
daily deals. Last month, the Washington-based company announced
LivingSocial Shop, an e-commerce store for discounted furniture,
clothing and other goods. The site mirrors Groupon Goods, a
shopping site started last year that accounted for most of
Groupon’s sales growth in North America in the second quarter.  Travelzoo Inc. (TZOO)  increased its market share to 3 percent,
according to Yipit. AmazonLocal, a partnership between
LivingSocial and  Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) , kept its 2 percent share.  To contact the reporter on this story:
