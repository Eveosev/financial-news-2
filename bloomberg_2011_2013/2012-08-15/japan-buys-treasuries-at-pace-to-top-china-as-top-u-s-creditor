Japan , which has purchased almost
five times the amount of Treasuries as  China  in 2012, is on a
pace to  overtake  the world’s most populous country by year-end
as the largest creditor to the U.S., government data show.  Investors in Japan bought $10.4 billion of Treasuries in
June, bringing its purchases for 2012 to $61.3 billion and its
total holdings of the debt to $1.1193 trillion, Treasury data
released yesterday show.  That compares with China’s addition of $300 million to its
portfolio of U.S. government securities for the month, raising
its purchases this year to $12.4 billion and its stake in
Treasuries to $1.1643 trillion. Should both countries continue
buying at their respective paces through 2012, Japan will end
the year with more Treasuries.  “The last three months have cemented this notion that
there’s really a ceiling on Chinese holdings,” said Aaron Kohli, an interest-rate strategist BNP Paribas SA in New York,
one of 21 primary dealers that trade with the  Federal Reserve .
“So far, that’s posed no problem for the U.S. because there are
so many other willing buyers.”  Foreign investors held $5.29 trillion of Treasuries in
June, an increase of 0.7 percent for the month and 5.9 percent
for the year, government data show.  Overseas Holdings  Foreign investors increased their holdings of Treasuries to
50.3 percent of the $10.5 trillion marketable  U.S. debt  as of
June as the  European debt crisis  continued to worsen and job
growth in the U.S. showed signs of sputtering. The Fed extended
its program to extend the average maturity of its $1.65 trillion
Treasury portfolio through the end of the year. The Fed is the
 largest holder  of U.S. government securities.  The 10-year Treasury yield fell as low as 1.44 percent on
June 1, a record low surpassed on July 25 at 1.38 percent amid
speculation that the Fed would try to boost the  U.S. economy  by
initiating its third series of asset purchases, a policy known
as quantitative easing, or QE.  The U.S. central bank has held  interest rates  near zero
since 2008 and plans to keep them there through 2014 to
stimulate the world’s biggest economy. The Fed has also bought
$2.3 trillion of mortgage and Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in
two rounds of QE.  China Watch  China’s  currency reserves  have grown 1.9 percent to $3.24
trillion as of June, according to the People’s Bank of China.
The country’s currency reserves rose 11.7 percent in 2011, the
 smallest increase  since 2000.  “China’s reduced buying is on a lot of people’s radar,”
said  David Ader , head of U.S. government bond strategy at CRT
Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut . “There could be
bigger issues down the road, and those issues would come about
from reduced trade surpluses.”  Japan posted a bigger-than-forecast current-account surplus
of 433.3 billion yen ($5.49 billion) in June, compared with a
215.1 billion yen surplus in May, Japan’s Ministry of Finance
said Aug. 8. Japan has been more reliant on income from overseas
investment to support its current account after last year’s
earthquake and nuclear accident bolstered demand for imported
energy.  “Japan’s going through the same thing,” Ader said.
“They’ve had a trade deficit and so presumably their current
account would not warrant the type of buying that we’ve seen,
and that would then be a problem.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
