Canepa Asset Brasil, a Rio de
Janeiro-based asset management firm, plans to hire five people,
including analysts, managers and economists, over the next month
to start its operations in about 45 days, Founding Partner
Alexandre Povoa said.  “We’ll start with an equity fund, but the idea is to
create a full  asset management company ,” said Povoa, former
president of Modal Asset Management, in a telephone interview
from Rio de Janeiro. “We’ll have private equity funds, real-
estate funds and Canepa will also seek businesses in  Latin
America .”  The firm, a partnership between Povoa and Luxemburg’s
Canepa Management, has raised 60 million reais ($29.7 million)
for its equity portfolio, according to an e-mailed statement
today.  Brazil may expand at a 3.5-percent to 4-percent pace in the
next years and “there’s reasonable money to enter the country
when the global economy improves,” Povoa said. “The  Bovespa (IBOV) 
index around 55,000 seems to be a good buy.”  The Sao Paulo exchange benchmark index gained 0.3 percent
to 58,279 at 4:10 p.m. and has advanced 2.7 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
