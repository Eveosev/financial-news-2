The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index may
reach 1,500 this year as the economy picks up momentum in the
fourth quarter, according toByron Wien, vice chairman of
Blackstone Group LP’s advisory services unit.  “Housing is bottoming, gasoline is down from the beginning
of the year, 90 percent of the people in the country have
jobs,” Wien said in an interview this morning on Bloomberg
Television’s “In the Loop” show. “The European situation is
getting better, not resolved, but getting better.”  Wien’s prediction implies a 6.8 percent rally in the  S&P
500  from yesterday’s closing level of 1,403.93. The index is up
about 12 percent this year amid speculation central banks will
continue to support the global economic recovery if needed. The
U.S. equity benchmark was little changed today after a two-day
decline.  Wien has been making annual forecasts since 1986, when he
was chief U.S. investment strategist at Morgan Stanley. His
average score is five out of 10, he said in a Blackstone webcast
in January.  The fiscal cliff will be deferred, Wien said, referring to
higher taxes and spending cuts that will take effect at year-end
unless Congress and the White House reach a deficit-reduction
agreement. He also predicted the European Union will be broken
up or restructured in the next 10 to 12 months. That may spur a
rally in stocks on optimism that the region’s debt crisis is
resolved.  Wien said he remains bullish on gold on speculation that
the metal will rise as stimulus measures by central banks around
the world will weaken currencies. Gold futures advanced 0.3
percent to $1,604.60 an ounce today after a U.S. report showing
stagnant consumer prices bolstered prospects that the  Federal
Reserve  will take further steps to spur growth, reviving
inflation and demand for the metal as a hedge.  Shares of companies that supply building materials are
poised to rally as the U.S. housing market recovers, Wien said.
Economic data today showed confidence among U.S. homebuilders
climbed in August to the highest level in more than five years,
affirming the improvement in residential construction. An S&P
measure of 11 homebuilder stocks has rallied 53 percent in 2012.  To contact the reporters on this story:
