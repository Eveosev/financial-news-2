The pound erased a decline against
the euro after reports showed the U.K. unemployment rate fell in
June and Bank of England policy makers voted 9-0 to keep the
asset-purchase facility and benchmark interest rate unchanged
this month.  Sterling was little changed at 78.58 pence per euro at 9:33
a.m. London time after weakening as much as 0.3 percent. It rose
0.1 percent to $1.5694.  To contact the reporter on this story:
