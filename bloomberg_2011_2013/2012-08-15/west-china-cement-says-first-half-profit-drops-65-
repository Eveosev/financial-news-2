West China Cement Ltd. (2233) , whose
corporate governance and financial statements were questioned by
a short seller, said yesterday first-half profit fell 65 percent
because average selling prices were lower and costs increased.  Net income  fell to 148.5 million  yuan  ($23 million), or
0.03 yuan a share, from 419 million yuan, or 0.10 yuan, a year
earlier, the cement-maker said in a Hong Kong stock exchange
filing yesterday. Sales fell 7.1 percent to 1.59 billion yuan.  The cement market in Shaanxi province will gradually
recover this year, with pricing power maintained and possibly
improved, it said. West China on Aug. 9 said its business was
“healthy” in response to a report by Glaucus Research Group,
which identifies itself on its website as a California-based
research group that also engages in short-selling. West China
didn’t mention the report in yesterday’s filing.  Bigger rival  Anhui Conch Cement Co. (914)  on Aug. 14 said first-
half profit slumped 51 percent to 2.93 billion yuan as demand
was dented by the Chinese government’s property curbs.  West China Cement’s shares fell 0.8 percent to HK$1.18, the
lowest level in two weeks, at close of  Hong Kong  trading today.
The company didn’t recommend payment of an interim dividend,
compared with a payout of 0.02 yuan a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
