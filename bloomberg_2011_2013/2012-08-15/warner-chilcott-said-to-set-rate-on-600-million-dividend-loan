Warner Chilcott Plc (WCRX) , a drugmaker
specializing in womanâ€™s health and dermatology, set the interest
rate it will pay on $600 million in loans the company is seeking
to fund a shareholder dividend, according to a person with
knowledge of the transaction.   The five-year, $300 million B-4/5 portion will pay interest
at 3 percentage points more than the London interbank offered
rate, said the person, who asked not to be identified because
the terms are private.  Warner Chilcott will sell the loan at 99.5 cents on the
dollar, the person said, reducing proceeds for the company and
boosting the yield to investors.  A $300 million B-6 piece due in March 2018 will pay
interest at 3.25 percentage points more than Libor, with a 1
percent floor, according to the person. The debt will be sold to
investors at 99.25 cents, the person said.  Lenders on both term loans will be offered one-year soft
call protection of 101 cents, the person said, meaning the
company would have to pay 1 cent more than face value to
refinance the debt during its first year.  Bank of America Corp. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. are
arranging the debt for the Dublin-based company and investors
must let the banks know by 3 p.m. today in New York whether they
will participate in the transaction, the person said. The deal
is expected to be distributed to investors this afternoon,
according to the person.  To contact the reporter on this story:
