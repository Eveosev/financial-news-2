Treasuries snapped a two-day loss
before a government report today that economists said will show
U.S. inflation is in check.  Benchmark 10-year yields climbed to 1.74 percent yesterday,
surpassing increases in the  consumer price index . CPI gains
slowed to 1.6 percent in July compared with a year earlier, from
1.7 percent in June, according to a Bloomberg News survey of
economists before the Labor Department report at 8:30 a.m. in
 Washington . Prices rose 0.2 percent in July from June, the
survey shows, the first advance since March.  “We’re in a disinflationary environment,” said Hans Goetti, the Singapore-based chief investment officer for  Asia  at
Finaport Investment Intelligence, which manages the equivalent
of $1.44 billion. “This is a good time to buy” Treasuries.  Ten-year  yields  declined 1 1/2 basis points from
yesterday’s close to 1.72 percent as of 7 a.m. in  London ,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader data. The price of the 1.625
percent security due in August 2022 rose 1/8, or $1.25 per
$1,000 face amount, to 99 3/32.  Japan ’s 10-year yield rose 2 1/2 basis points to 0.815
percent, the most in almost six weeks. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  Household Debt  U.S. 30-year yields, little changed at 2.82 percent, may
drop to 2 percent in the years ahead, Goetti said. Households
are cutting debt and governments may do the same, creating a
period of deleveraging that is keeping inflation under control,
he said. Goetti said he bought Treasuries more than a year ago
and is considering purchasing more.  A  gauge  of U.S. household indebtedness fell for a record 12
quarters to the lowest level since 1994. The ratio of  household
debt  payments to disposable income declined to 10.98 in the
first quarter, down from a peak of 13.96 in September 2007,
according data from the  Federal Reserve .  Today’s reports will also probably show factory production
expanded and homebuilder confidence stabilized in the U.S.,
according to separate Bloomberg surveys of economists.  The Fed plans to sell as much as $8 billion of notes due
from February 2014 to August 2014 today, according to the
 website  of its  New York  branch. The sales are part of the
central bank’s effort to support the economy by swapping
shorter-term Treasuries in its holdings for securities due in 6
to 30 years to cap long-term borrowing costs.  Improving Economy  Ten-year yields have climbed from the record low of 1.38
percent set July 25 on signs the  U.S. economy  is improving.  The U.S. added 163,000 jobs last month, a government report
showed Aug. 3, more than the 100,000 projected by analysts.
 Retail sales  rose 0.8 percent, the biggest increase since
February, Commerce Department figures showed yesterday.  “Yields are going to rise,” said Hideo Shimomura, who
helps oversee the equivalent of $76.1 billion in  Tokyo  as chief
fund investor at Mitsubishi UFJ Asset Management Co., part of
Japan’s largest publicly traded bank. “There’s not a recession.
Inflation’s not a problem, but inflation expectations are
heading north.”  Shimomura said he’d like to wait until 10-year yields
advance to 1.8 percent before adding to his holdings. A
Bloomberg survey of economists shows the rate will be 1.78
percent by year-end, with the most recent projections given the
heaviest weightings.  The yield will be more than 2 percent next year, Dominic Konstam, the global head of interest-rate research in New York
for Deutsche Bank AG, wrote in the report yesterday. The bank is
one of the 21 primary dealers that underwrite the  U.S. debt .  Producer Prices  The  producer price index  rose 0.3 percent in July from the
month before, after an increase of 0.1 percent in June, the
Labor Department reported yesterday in Washington. The median
estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was a 0.2 percent
gain. Core prices, which exclude volatile food and energy costs,
climbed 0.4 percent, the most since January.  The difference between 10-year yields on Treasury
Inflation-Protected Securities and conventional U.S. government
securities has widened to 2.27 percentage points from as low as
1.98 on July 26. The spread represents the expected rate of
price gains for the life of the debt.  The Fed’s favored  bond-market gauge  of inflation
expectations was 2.54 percent on Aug. 10, up from 2.38 percent
on July 26 and matching the average for 2012. That puts the
measure above the 2 percent levels in 2008 and 2010 that led the
central bank to pump $2.3 trillion into the economy by
purchasing Treasuries and mortgage-related bonds, the policy
known as quantitative easing. The five-year, five-year measure
shows how much traders anticipate consumer prices will rise
during a period of five years starting in 2017.  Demand for inflation protection has pushed an index of TIPS
to a 4.8 percent gain this year, according to Bank of America
Merrill Lynch indexes. Conventional Treasuries returned 1.7
percent, the figures show.  The Treasury is scheduled to announce tomorrow the size of
a five-year TIPS sale scheduled for Aug. 23.  To contact the reporter on this story:
