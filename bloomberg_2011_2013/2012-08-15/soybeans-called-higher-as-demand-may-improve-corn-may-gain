What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets, which open at 5 p.m. on the
Chicago Board of Trade.  -- Soybean futures are called to open 2 cents to 3 cents higher
on speculation that a U.S. Department of Agriculture report
tomorrow will show increased exports of the oilseed and its
products, said  Dax Wedemeyer , a commodity broker at US
Commodities in  West Des Moines ,  Iowa . Soybean-oil futures may
open 0.1 cent to 0.2 cent a pound higher, and soybean-meal
futures may open $1 to $2 higher per 2,000 pounds.  -- Corn futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher on
speculation that demand for the grain may increase, Wedemeyer
said.  -- Wheat futures may open 1 cent to 2 cents a bushel higher,
Wedemeyer said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
