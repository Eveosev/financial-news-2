JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  is considering
adding Nigerian domestic bonds to its government bond emerging
market index series on Oct. 1, according to a note from the bank
obtained by Bloomberg.  The inclusion would be phased over three months, according
to the note that was sent to clients. The GBI-EM Index series
may include government debt maturing in 2014, 2019 and 2022 as
they are the country’s most liquid bonds, according to the note.
Sarah Stipicevic, a spokeswoman for JPMorgan in  New York ,
declined to comment when contacted by phone.  “Market conditions may change from now until the primary
inclusion date,” the note said. “In which case, this list may
be subject to change.”  Nigeria , Africa’s biggest oil producer, has been seeking
inclusion into emerging-market indexes to increase portfolio
flows into the nation’s capital markets. Securities and Exchange
Commission Director General Arunma Oteh said in an interview in
October that she was planning to discuss the inclusion with
index providers such as JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley.  Yields on Nigeria’s 16.39 percent notes due 2022 dropped 36
basis points today, or 0.36 percentage points, to 16 percent,
according to prices on the Financial Markets Dealers Association
website.  Nigeria’s total domestic debt rose 18 percent to $39
billion at the end of June from a year earlier, according to the
Debt Management Office in the capital Abuja. Finance Minister
Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala said on Aug. 8 that the government wants to
reduce domestic borrowing.  The naira has risen 3.2 percent to 157.2 a dollar this
year, making it  Africa ’s second best performing currency in
2012. The nation’s benchmark  Bonny Light crude  blend has
advanced 27 percent from a 2012 low in June.  To contact the reporter on this story:
