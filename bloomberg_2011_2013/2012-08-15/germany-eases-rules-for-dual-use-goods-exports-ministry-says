Chancellor  Angela Merkel ’s Cabinet
today eased national rules limiting exports of goods that can be
used for military purposes after the laws were superseded by
European Union directives, the  Economy Ministry  said.  Fifty-year old export approval procedures that don’t exist
in other countries for goods such as  machine tools  were scrapped
because they’ve lost their significance while still placing
bureaucratic burdens on companies that hurt their international
competitiveness, the Berlin-based ministry said.  Intentional unapproved export of dual-use goods will still
be punished the same way as the intentional unapproved export of
arms, which constitutes a criminal offense, the ministry said in
an e-mailed statement. Any breaches of arms embargoes will be
prosecuted as crimes, the ministry said.  The Cabinet’s decision requires a vote in the lower house
of parliament, the Bundestag, to become law.  To contact the reporter on this story:
