The forint weakened and  government
bonds  slid as signs the world’s biggest economies are slowing
curbed investor appetite for riskier emerging-market assets.  Hungary’s forint depreciated 0.2 percent to 279.30 per euro
by 2:37 p.m. in Budapest, making it the second-worst performer
among more than 20 emerging currencies tracked by Bloomberg.
Benchmark 10-year bonds weakened, lifting the yield one basis
point, or 0.01 percentage point, to 7.455 percent.  Emerging-market stocks fell on signs U.S. factories are
burdened by the global slowdown and eroding loan quality at
Chinese lenders. Manufacturing in the  New York  area unexpectedly
contracted in August for the first time in 10 months, and
 China ’s banking regulator said bad debt increased for a third
straight quarter, the longest streak of deterioration in eight
years.  To contact the reporter on this story:
