Thailand’s baht fell the most in
three weeks and  government bonds  rose amid concern a global
economic slowdown will hurt exports.  South Korea,  India ,  Indonesia  and Taiwan all released trade
figures since the start of August showing slides in their
overseas sales, while Thailand’s shipments declined in six of
the eight months through June. Data released yesterday showed
the euro-area economy shrank in the second quarter as a regional
debt crisis and austerity measures forced at least six nations
into recessions.  “Weakening global growth is finally taking its toll on
Asian exports,” said Wee-Khoon Chong, a fixed-income strategist
at Societe Generale SA in  Hong Kong . “This in turn is likely to
drag Asian growth lower, which would not bode well for regional
currencies.”  The baht dropped 0.3 percent to 31.51 per dollar as of 8:49
a.m. in Bangkok, the biggest loss since July 23, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. Its three-month implied volatility,
a measure of exchange-rate swings used to price options,
declined two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.21
percent.  Global funds sold $1.5 million more Thai equities than they
bought yesterday, ending a six-day run of net purchases that
boosted their holdings by $212 million, stock exchange data
show. Overseas investors reduced their ownership of Thailand’s
government  debt  by $166 million yesterday, according to the Thai
Bond Market Association.  The yield on the 3.25 percent bonds due June 2017 fell one
basis point to 3.09 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
