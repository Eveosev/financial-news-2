Florida’s orange crop may drop to
140 million boxes in the season starting in October, according
to Tom Spreen, a retired University of Florida professor,
TheLedger.com reported.  That would be down 4.4 percent from 146.5 million boxes in
the previous season, as estimated by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture, the newspaper said. Spreen, who taught at
University of Florida’s Food and Resource Economics Department,
in Gainesville, spoke today during the Florida Citrus Expo in
 Fort Myers .  Brazil is the world’s biggest citrus grower. Florida’s
harvest will start next month and will run through June. The
USDA will release its first forecast on Oct. 11. A box weighs 90
pounds, or 41 kilograms.  To contact the reporter on this story:
