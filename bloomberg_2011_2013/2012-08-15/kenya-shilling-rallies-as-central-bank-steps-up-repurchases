Kenya ’s shilling strengthened as the
central bank stepped up the amount of money it removed from the
market through  repurchase agreements .  The currency of East Africa’s largest economy appreciated
0.4 percent to 83.70 per dollar as of 4:23 p.m. in Nairobi, the
capital, gaining for a second day this week.  The Central Bank of Kenya sold 8.7 billion shillings ($104
million) of seven-day repurchase agreements at a weighted
average yield of 8.623 percent, a central bank official, who
asked not to be named in line with policy, said today. The bank
sold 3.3 billion shillings in repos yesterday and 3 billion
shillings on Aug. 13.  “The shilling has gained as we see central bank increasing
the amount its curbing from the market,” Jeremiah Kendagor,
head of trading at Nairobi-based  Kenya Commercial Bank Ltd. (KNCB) ,
said in a phone interview today.  The central bank also sold 1 billion shillings of 14-day
term-auction deposits at 9 percent, the official said.  The Tanzanian shilling weakened 0.1 percent to 1,579 to the
dollar, while  Uganda ’s shilling was little changed at 2,480.50
versus the U.S. currency.  To contact the reporter on this story:
