Lleyton Hewitt  and  James Blake  were
given wild-card entries to the 2012 U.S. Open, the final Grand
Slam of the tennis season.  The tournament will be played Aug. 27 to Sept. 9 at the
National Tennis Center in Flushing, New York. The men’s and
women’s singles winners will each receive a record $1.9 million.  Former world No. 1 Hewitt, a 31-year-old Australian, missed
the U.S. Open for the second time in four years in 2011. The
winner of 28 career singles titles including the U.S. Open in
2001 and Wimbledon the following year, Hewitt lost in the fourth
round of January’s Australian Open and in the first round at the
French Open and Wimbledon.  Blake, 32, of Tampa, Florida, reached the quarterfinals of
the 2005 U.S. Open as a wild card, upsetting  Rafael Nadal  before
losing to  Andre Agassi  in five sets. Blake missed this year’s
Australian Open and lost in the first round at the French Open
and Wimbledon.  Steve Johnson, the National Collegiate Athletic Association
singles champion, was also given a place in the main draw by
tournament organizer the U.S. Tennis Association.  While at the University of Southern California, Johnson,
22, was undefeated in singles to claim his second straight NCAA
singles title and lead his school to its fourth team title.  Jack Sock, who in 2010 became the first American since  Andy Roddick  10 years earlier to win the U.S. Open boys’ title, also
got a place, along with Denis Kudla, whom he beat in the final.  To contact the reporter on this story:
