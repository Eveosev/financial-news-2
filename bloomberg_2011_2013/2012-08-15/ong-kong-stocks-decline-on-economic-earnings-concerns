Hong Kong  stocks  declined, with the
 Hang Seng Index (HSI)  retreating from a three-month high, on concern
 China ’s deepening economic slowdown will damp corporate profits.  China Life Insurance Co. (2628) , the nation’s biggest insurer by
market value, fell 2.3 percent after posting lower premium
income. China Aerospace International Holdings Ltd. dropped 3.5
percent after the maker of liquid crystal displays predicted a
decline in profit. Li & Fung Ltd., a supplier of toys and
clothes to retailers including Wal-Mart Stores Inc., rose 1.9
percent after retail sales in the U.S. rose more than analysts
expected in July.  The Hang Seng Index slipped 1.1 percent to 20,065.34 as of
10:11 a.m. local time, with 22 shares falling for each that
rose. The gauge climbed 2.4 percent last week on speculation
China will add to economic stimulus after export growth
collapsed, industrial production unexpectedly slowed and
inflation decelerated. The Hang Seng China Enterprises Index of
mainland companies sank 1.2 percent to 9,798.46.  “The earnings momentum and the growth outlook is just too
weak for equities to keep going higher,” Simon Grose-Hodge,
head of investment strategy for  Asia  at LGT Group, said on
Bloomberg Television. “Investors want to see more stimulus from
China.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
