Canada ’s dollar climbed to the
highest level since May versus its U.S. counterpart, trading
stronger than parity for a ninth day, amid speculation North
American economic growth will sustain the nation’s exports.  The currency has gained versus the majority of its 16 most-
traded peers this month after jobs and retail sales in the U.S.,
Canada’s biggest trade partner, rose more than forecast in July.
The euro has slid, reaching a record low today against Canada’s
dollar, amid concern European leaders are struggling to resolve
their debt crisis. American industrial production exceeded
estimates last month, data showed today.  “Canada is still seen as a safe place to park money on a
relative basis,”  Shane Enright ,  executive director  at Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce’s CIBC World Markets unit in Toronto,
said in a telephone interview. “The U.S. industrial production
number came in slightly better than expected; that was a little
bit Canada-supportive.”  The Canadian currency, nicknamed the loonie for the image
of the waterfowl on the C$1 coin, appreciated 0.3 percent to
98.94 cents per U.S. dollar at 5 p.m. in Toronto. It touched
98.87 cents, the strongest since May 4. One Canadian dollar buys
$1.0107. The two currencies reached a one-for-one basis on Aug.
3 for the first time since May.  The loonie advanced as much as 0.7 percent against the euro
to C$1.2145, the strongest since the 17-nation currency began
trading in 1999.  Canada’s dollar has gained 3.5 percent this year against
nine developed-nation counterparts monitored by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted indexes. It was the best performance after
the New Zealand dollar’s 4.2 percent advance. The  U.S. dollar 
was little changed.  Low Volatility  Implied volatility for one-month options on the U.S. dollar
versus the Canadian currency was at almost the lowest in more
than five years. It fell for a second day, reaching 6.240 and
approaching the 6.2225 percent it reached on July 20, the lowest
on an intraday basis since May 2007. The five-year average is 12
percent. Implied volatility, which traders quote and use to set
option prices, signals the expected pace of currency swings.  Government bonds  dropped for a third day, pushing yields on
the  10-year benchmark  security up 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 1.95 percent, the highest level since May
16. The price of the 2.75 percent notes maturing in June 2022
slid 90 cents to C$107.08.  Debt Auction  Canada auctioned C$3.4 billion ($3.44 billion) of five-year
debt today, drawing an average yield of 1.538 percent. The
securities carry a 1.5 percent coupon and mature in September
2017. The sale attracted C$8.8 billion in bids, for a bid-to-
cover ratio of 2.60. The last five-year security sale, an
offering of the same amount of bonds, drew an average yield of
1.244 percent and had a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.65.  The loonie gained versus most major currencies as Standard
& Poor’s GSCI index of  raw materials  climbed 1 percent, and
crude oil for September delivery rose to as high as $94.90 a
barrel in  New York , the most since May 15. Raw materials
including oil account for about half of Canada’s export revenue,
and crude is the nation’s biggest export.  The loonie extended its advance after Federal Reserve data
showed U.S. industrial production increased 0.6 percent in July,
after a revised 0.1 percent gain in June that was smaller than
previously reported. Economists in a Bloomberg News survey
forecast a 0.5 percent rise. Manufacturing, which makes up about
75 percent of total production, advanced 0.5 percent for a
second month.  Canada ships about three quarters of its exports to the
U.S.  Canadian Manufacturing  Canadian  factory sales  rose in June for the first time in
three months, economists in a Bloomberg News survey forecast
before  Statistics Canada  reports the data tomorrow.
Manufacturing sales increased 0.3 percent, after a 0.4 percent
drop in May, they projected.  The loonie has traded at stronger levels than its 50-, 100-
and 200-day moving averages since July 26 as it gained beyond
parity with its U.S. counterpart. The Canadian dollar has been
as strong this year as 98 cents to the greenback on April 27 and
as weak as C$1.0447 on June 4.  The U.S. currency gained earlier versus most major peers
after Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report yesterday the
Fed will delay a third round of bond-buying, known as
quantitative easing.  Retail Sales  U.S.  retail sales  advanced 0.8 percent in July, data showed
yesterday, the biggest jump since February and first gain in
four months, the Commerce Department said yesterday. American
employers added 163,000 jobs last month, the government said
Aug. 3, compared to a 64,000 increase in June.  The loonie remained higher today even after a report showed
the cost of living in the U.S. remained little changed in July
and a factory gauge of the New York region unexpectedly fell.  The U.S. consumer price index reading capped a 1.4 percent
gain over the past 12 months, the smallest year-to-year increase
since November 2010, the Labor Department reported today in
 Washington . The Fed Bank of New York’s general economic index
dropped to minus 5.9 this month. A Bloomberg survey projected
7.0. Negative readings signal contraction.  “As long as CPI is fairly soft, as long as the data does
not continue to surprise on the upside as it has, then it leaves
the door open to the potential for QE3,”  Camilla Sutton , chief
currency strategist at Bank of  Nova Scotia ’s Scotiabank unit in
Toronto, said in a phone interview.  The U.S. central bank bought $2.3 trillion of assets in two
rounds of quantitative easing between December 2008 and June
2011 to spur the economy.  To contact the reporter on this story:
