Gasoline advanced to a 15-week high
on declining inventories, higher demand and a rally in Brent
crude oil.  Futures gained 2.8 percent as the Energy Department
reported  gasoline supplies  dropped 2.37 million barrels to 203.7
million, the lowest level since the week ended June 15 and the
lowest for this time of the year since 2008. Wholesale demand
jumped to a 13-month high. Rising Brent prices increased the
price of imported crude and gasoline.  “I don’t see demand being sustainable, but you’ve got a
host of refinery problems and the market is worried about
incremental supply,” said  Andrew Lebow , a senior vice president
at Jefferies Bache LLC in  New York . “I don’t think there is a
lot of supply coming from  Europe  because they’re going into
turnaround. It’s looking tight.”  September-delivery gasoline rose 8.26 cents to $3.084 a
gallon on the  New York Mercantile Exchange , the highest
settlement since May 1.  Brent for September settlement gained $2.22, or 1.9
percent, to $116.25 a barrel on the ICE Futures Europe exchange.  “Combine that storage report with the strength in Brent
today and you get a 5-cent move,” said  Addison Armstrong ,
director of market research at Tradition Energy in  Stamford ,
 Connecticut .  Gasoline inventories are down 3 percent in the three weeks
ended Aug. 10. In the PADD 1 region, which includes New York
Harbor, the delivery point of Nymex futures, stockpiles sank
1.78 million barrels to 49.9 million, the lowest level for early
August since the Energy Department began reporting weekly data
in 1990.  Third Week  “This is the third week in a row that gasoline has drawn a
decent size,” said  David Pursell , a managing director at Tudor
Pickering Holt & Co. LLC in Houston.  Gasoline  demand  rose 5.3 percent to 9.31 million barrels a
day, the fourth consecutive gain. Consumption over the past four
weeks was 2.8 percent below a year earlier, narrower than the
4.2 percent difference the previous week.  The slide in inventories has followed a series of refinery
shutdowns. BP Plc yesterday suspended work on a hydrotreater at
its 420,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Whiting,  Indiana , the
largest Midwest plant, after a flash fire injured three workers.
An Aug. 6 fire shut the only crude unit at Chevron Corp.’s
240,000-barrel-a-day refinery in Richmond,  California .  “Gasoline continues its bullish run on a spate of refining
problems that have reduced inventories around the country,”
said  Andy Lipow , president of Lipow Oil Associates LLC in
Houston.  Distillate Supplies  Supplies of distillates, including heating oil and diesel,
rose 677,000 barrels to 124.2 million, the first increase in
three weeks.  U.S. factory output in July rose 0.6 percent, Federal
Reserve data showed today, indicating that demand for diesel may
improve. Heating oil is traded as a substitute for diesel.  Heating oil for September delivery gained 5.06 cents, or
1.7 percent, to $3.0852 a gallon on the exchange.  Regular  gasoline  at the pump, averaged nationwide, rose 0.7
cent to $3.709 a gallon yesterday, AAA data showed. That’s the
highest level since May 17. Prices have climbed 38.3 cents since
July 1, according to data from the nation’s largest motoring
organization.  To contact the reporters on this story:
