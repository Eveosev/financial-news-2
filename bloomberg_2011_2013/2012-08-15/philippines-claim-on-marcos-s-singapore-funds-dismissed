The  Philippines ’ claim on $23
million its late president  Ferdinand Marcos  had looted and held
in trust at West Landesbank AG’s Singapore branch was dismissed
by a Singapore Court.  Justice Andrew Ang dismissed competing claims by the
Philippines, citizens who suffered human rights abuses during
Marcos’s rule and five others seeking access to the funds kept
in the branch.  He allowed a claim by the Philippine National Bank,
controlled by Lucio Tan, because it has legal title to the
funds, according to a 75-page decision made public today. West
Landesbank asked Singapore’s  High Court  in 2004 to help
determine the owners of the money, part of what the judgment
said was $567 million in ill-gotten gains of the Marcos family
and his aides in various bank accounts.  Marcos, who took power in 1965, was overthrown in 1986 and
exiled from the Southeast Asian nation. In 2003, the Philippines
Supreme Court ordered more than $658 million of Marcos’s assets
to be returned to the country.  Singapore’s courts can’t recognize the Philippines’ claim,
which was based on the 2003 verdict, as the funds were never in
the Philippines, Ang wrote.  The Philippines is “still considering the implications of
the ruling,” said  S. Suressh , a lawyer acting for the Southeast
Asian nation.  The Singapore case is WestLB AG v  Philippine National Bank. (PNB)
