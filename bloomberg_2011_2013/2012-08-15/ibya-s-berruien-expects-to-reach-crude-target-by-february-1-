Libya ’s  crude output  will increase
to a target of 1.7 million barrels a day by February, said Nuri Berruien, chairman of state-run National Oil Corp.  The country currently pumps 1.55 million to 1.57 million
barrels a day, he said today by telephone from the capital,
Tripoli today.  “The situation on the market caused production
disruption,” Berruien said. “But everything is now back to
normal. We are on track to reaching the final goal of 1.7
million barrels if not by the end of the year, then in January
or February.”  Libya, holder of  Africa ’s biggest crude reserves, was
forced to cut production last month as protesters briefly
occupied three export ports amid the nation’s first free
elections in more than 40 years. The country is seeking to boost
its output after an anti-government rebellion last year
disrupted production and exports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
