Germany sold 850,000 European Union
2012 carbon permits at 7.47 euros ($9.18) a metric ton in an
auction on the European Energy Exchange AG, according to the
Leipzig-based company’s website.  The country is selling as many as 21 million tons of spot
and 32 million tons of futures contracts in weekly sales as part
of its allocation of permits in 2012. The EU’s emissions trading
system is in its second phase, which runs from 2008 to the end
of this year.  EEX  has also auctioned Phase 2 permits on behalf of the
Netherlands and  Lithuania  and is selling Phase 3 permits for
delivery in 2013 for the  European Investment Bank .  To contact the reporter on this story:
