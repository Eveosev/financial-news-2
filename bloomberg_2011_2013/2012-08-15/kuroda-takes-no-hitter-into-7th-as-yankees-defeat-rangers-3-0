Hiroki Kuroda took a no-hitter into
the seventh inning as the New York Yankees defeated the Texas
Rangers 3-0 in a matchup of the top two teams in the  American
League .  Kuroda (11-8) allowed two hits and struck out five last
night at Yankee Stadium. It was his fourth career complete game,
all of them shutouts.  Elvis Andrus  broke up the no-hitter with
an infield single.  The Yankees got all their runs in the seventh inning.  Nick Swisher  hit a two-run homer, his 16th of the Major League
Baseball season, and  Mark Teixeira  followed with his 23rd homer.  Matt Harrison (13-7) allowed one run on five hits in 6 1/3
innings for Texas. He was relieved by Alexi Ogando, who gave up
the home runs to Swisher and Teixeira.  The Yankees lead the AL with a 69-47 record, 1 1/2 games
ahead of the Rangers (67-48).  The Yankees, who have won six of their past seven games,
opened the series against Texas with an 8-2 victory two nights
ago. The teams reconvene tonight and tomorrow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
