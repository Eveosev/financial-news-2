WellPoint Inc. (WLP) , the health insurer
that’s lost 18 percent of its market value over two months, is
the least popular carrier among hospital executives who have to
negotiate with the company, an industry survey shows.  The second-biggest U.S. health plan was ranked last among
the six largest for-profit  insurers , undercut by low ratings for
rejecting claims and fixing wrongly-denied bills. The  poll of
403 executives  was conducted by ReviveHealth, a communications
company that works with hospitals. The showing for Indianapolis-
based WellPoint was its worst in the survey’s six years.  Angela Braly, WellPoint’s chief executive officer since
2007, has faced investors’ ire since cutting her 2012 profit
forecast last month and posting earnings that missed analysts’
estimates for the second time this year. The insurer, which owns
Blue Cross plans in 14 states, has tried to improve earnings by
cutting costs, setting up more confrontations with hospitals,
said Brandon Edwards, ReviveHealth’s president.  “Hospitals say WellPoint is just exceptionally difficult
to deal with,” Edwards said in a telephone interview from
ReviveHealth’s Nashville, Tennessee, headquarters. “Even though
they’re only present in about one-third of the states, they were
still rated the absolute worst overall.”  WellPoint was viewed favorably by 27 percent of the
executives polled, ReviveHealth said in a  statement .  Cigna
Corp. (CI) , based in Bloomfield,  Connecticut , had the best
reputation, at 71 percent, while Minnetonka, Minnesota-based
 UnitedHealth Group Inc. (UNH) , the only carrier bigger than WellPoint,
improved for the second straight year at 44 percent.  Survey Questions  Kristin Binns, a WellPoint spokeswoman,and Phil Mann, of
Cigna, didn’t immediately respond to messages seeking comment.  WellPoint rose 1.6 percent to $57.80 at the close of New
York trading, while UnitedHealth also gained 1.6 percent to
$52.82. Cigna increased less than 1 percent to $43.86.  The survey asked executives to assess insurers on more than
a dozen topics, including image and reputation, contract
negotiations and claims-processing.  WellPoint’s tough stance may reflect the dominance of its
Blue Cross plans in states where it operates, said  Jason Gurda ,
a Leerink Swann & Co. analyst in New York.  “They tend to have a lot of market share and having a lot
of market share means you don’t have to be as generous as
everybody else,” Gurda said in a telephone interview.  UnitedHealth scored worse than WellPoint in more individual
categories, including honesty and candor, timeliness and
responsiveness and processing and paying claims, the survey
shows. Executives credited the insurer for taking steps to
improve, Edwards said.  UnitedHealth Movement  “Most of our hospitals would tell us, ‘United’s still not
great, but we see movement,’” he said.  The  American Medical Association  said in June that
UnitedHealth was the most accurate carrier for handling claims,
according to its annual insurer report card, said Daryl Richard,
a spokesman for the company’s UnitedHealthcare unit.  “We continue to strengthen our relationships with care
providers across the country,” he said in an e-mail.
“Productive, collaborative relationships between physicians and
companies like UnitedHealthcare are important if we are going to
make progress together.”  The insurer has more than 500 employees in its Provider
Relations group assigned to work with doctors and hospitals and
it’s restructured call center operations to better communicate
with providers, Richard said.  The survey was sponsored by The Godbey Group, an Irving,
Texas-based company that assists hospitals with managed-care
negotiations, and Monigle Associates, a Denver-based marketing
firm that works with health-care companies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
