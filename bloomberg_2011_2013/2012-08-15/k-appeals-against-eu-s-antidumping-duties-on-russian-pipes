OAO TMK (TMKS) , Russia’s largest producer
of steel pipes for the oil and gas industry, is appealing
against import duties of as much as 27 percent levied on its
shipments to the European Union.  In July, the European Commission prolonged the antidumping
duties on Russian pipes through 2017, and TMK is preparing an
appeal, the company  said  in its second-quarter report. Russia is
set to join the  World Trade Organization  next week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
