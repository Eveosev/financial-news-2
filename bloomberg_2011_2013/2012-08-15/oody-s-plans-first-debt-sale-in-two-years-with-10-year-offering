Moody’s Corp. (MCO) , the world’s second-
largest provider of credit ratings, sold $500 million in bonds
for general corporate purposes, its first offering since 2010.  Moody’s issued the 4.5 percent, 10-year bonds to yield 280
basis points, or 2.8 percentage points, more than similar-
maturity Treasuries, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
Standard & Poor’s, the biggest credit-ratings firm, ranked the
debt BBB+, its third-lowest investment-grade level, according to
a statement.  The company last tapped the  debt market  in August 2010 with
a $500 million offering. The 5.5 percent securities due in
September 2020 traded at 108.7 cents on the dollar yesterday for
a yield of 4.2 percent, according to Trace, the bond-price
reporting system of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.  Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., and JPMorgan Chase &
Co. managed the sale, Bloomberg data show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
