Canadian Solar Inc. (CSIQ) , a solar-panel
company with manufacturing operations in  China , fell after
reporting a second-quarter loss that exceeded analysts’
estimates.  Canadian Solar, based in Kitchener, Ontario,  dropped  11
percent to $2.70 at the close in  New York . Earlier, the shares
declined as much as 16 percent, the biggest intraday fall since
Aug. 8, 2011.  The net loss was $25.5 million, or 59 cents a share,
compared with net income of $7.1 million, or 16 cents, a year
earlier, the company said in a statement today. It attributed
the drop to a decline in panel prices. Analysts expected a loss
of 29 cents, the average of three estimates compiled by
Bloomberg.  The company reiterated its forecast for shipment of as much
as 2 gigawatts of panels this year. “The level of uncertainty
in the solar market and macro economy has increased the risk to
our guidance,” Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Shawn Qu
said on a conference call with investors today.  “They’re really pushing their credibility by maintaining
full-year shipment guidance when they just had a miss,” said
 Mark Bachman , an analyst at Boston-based Avian Securities LLC
who has a buy rating on the shares. Canadian Solar will have to
ship more than 635 megawatts in the fourth quarter to meet the
low-end of their guidance, he said. “That’s going to be a real
challenge.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
