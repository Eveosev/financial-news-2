Connacher Oil and Gas Ltd. , the oil-
sands company that has retained Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to
explore strategic options, fell the most in more than two months
after agreeing to sell a Montana refinery.  The shares  dropped  9.3 percent to 39 Canadian cents at the
close in Toronto, the biggest decline since May 30.  Connacher expects proceeds of between $155 million and $170
million from the sale of its Great Falls refinery to Calumet
Special Products Partners LP, the Calgary-based company said in
a statement after the close of regular trading yesterday.  The sale of the heavy-oil refinery, which produces gasoline
and asphalt for markets in the western U.S. and  Canada , may
expose Connacher to more commodity price volatility, said  Randy Ollenberger  and Jared Dziuba, Calgary-based analysts for BMO
Capital Markets.  “We believe the loss of the downstream hedge could
introduce new volatility given our expectation of periodic
weakness in heavy-oil prices through 2013,” they wrote in a
note to investors today. BMO rates Connacher a market perform,
equivalent to a hold.  Connacher in January said it had retained Goldman Sachs to
review its business plan and consider strategic options. The
move came after the oil producer received an unsolicited
takeover offer last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
