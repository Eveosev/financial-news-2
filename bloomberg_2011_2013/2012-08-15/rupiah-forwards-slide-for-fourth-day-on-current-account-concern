Indonesia ’s rupiah forwards fell the
most in more than three weeks on speculation the current-account
deficit will widen as imports climb and exports slump.
 Government bonds  declined.  The 2012 current account will turn to a $16 billion
deficit, Standard Chartered Plc predicted in a report yesterday.
The shortfall widened to $6.9 billion in the second quarter from
$3.2 billion in the previous three months, official data show.
The trade deficit was $1.3 billion in June as exports fell 16.4
percent and imports rose 10.7 percent.  “The current account is still a concern because the demand
for dollars is still high for import payments,” said Rully
Nova, a currency analyst at PT Bank Himpunan Saudara 1906 in
Jakarta.  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.7 percent
to 10,053 as of 3:29 p.m. in Jakarta, a 5.4 percent discount to
the spot rate, data compiled by Bloomberg showed. That was the
weakest level since July 25. Forwards are agreements to buy or
sell assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts
are settled in dollars.  The rupiah fell 0.3 percent to 9,514 per dollar, according
to prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg. It has lost
4.7 percent this year, the second-worst performance among  Asia ’s
11 most-active currencies. One-month implied volatility, which
measures exchange-rate swings used to price options, slid 115
basis points, or 1.15 percentage point, to 6.0 percent.  “It’s difficult for the rupiah to strengthen,” Nova said.
“Domestic investors don’t want to invest at all in the rupiah
before the long holiday for Eid al-Fitr.”  Indonesian financial markets will be shut from Aug. 17
through Aug. 22 for the Muslim holiday.  The yield on the government’s 6.25 percent bonds due April
2017 increased two basis points to 5.52 percent, according to
prices from the Inter Dealer Market Association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
