Japanese  stocks  slid, with the
 Topix (TPX)  Index falling for the first time in three days, after the
euro-area economy contracted in the second quarter. Declines
were limited as U.S. retail sales rose more than estimated.  Nippon Sheet Glass Co. (5202) , which gets about 40 percent of its
sales in  Europe , fell 1.7 percent. Kobe Steel Ltd. led the
sector lower after an official at the world’s biggest ore
producer said  China ’s golden years of growth are over.
Sharp Corp.,  Japan ’s top maker of liquid-crystal panels, sank 12
percent on a Nikkei newspaper report the company is trimming its
sales forecast and after Deutsche Bank AG rated the stock a sell.  “Investors are being cautious about the European
economy,” said Seiji Iwama, a  fund manager  at Daiwa SB
Investments Ltd., which oversees about 5 trillion yen ($63.5
billion). “The markets view the  U.S. economy  as becoming more
solid because the data wasn’t as bad as people expected. When
trading volume is light, investors tend to buy or sell shares
based on a company’s individual factors.”  The  Nikkei 225 Stock Average (NKY)  slid 0.1 percent to 8,925.04
at the 3 p.m. close in Tokyo after rising as much as 0.3 percent
earlier. Volume on the gauge was more than 10 percent below the
30-day average with many investors off for O-bon holidays this
week. The broader Topix slid 0.3 percent to 747.32 today, with
about three shares falling for every two shares that gained.  The Topix has fallen 14 percent from this year’s peak on
March 27 on concern earnings will be hurt by Europe’s debt
crisis and slower growth in China and the U.S. The decline has
cut the price of shares on the gauge to 0.9 times book value,
compared with 2.2 for the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and 1.4
for the Europe Stoxx 600 Index. A number less than one means
companies can be bought for less than the value of their assets.  Euro GDP  Shares fell on a report the euro-area economy contracted
in the second quarter after the worsening debt crisis and
austerity cuts forced at least six nations into recession. GDP
in the 17-nation currency bloc fell 0.2 percent from the first
quarter, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg
said yesterday.  Nippon Sheet fell 1.7 percent to 57 yen.  Konica Minolta
Holdings Inc. (4902) , an office-equipment maker that gets almost 30
percent of its sales from Europe, lost 2.2 percent to 569 yen.  Futures on the  S&P 500 (SPXL1)  fell 0.1 percent today. The gauge
was little changed yesterday as a slump in technology and
financial shares reversed an earlier rally as U.S. retail sales
climbed more than forecast in July on a consumer-spending
rebound.  U.S. Retail  The 0.8 percent retail advance, the first gain in four
months, followed a revised 0.7 percent drop in June, Commerce
Department figures showed. Economists projected a 0.3 percent
increase, according to the median forecast in a Bloomberg survey.  Honda Motor Co. (7267) , a carmaker that gets almost 45 percent
of its sales from  North America , added 0.4 percent to 2,526 yen.
The shares also rose after the Nikkei newspaper reported Japan
will offer subsidies for ultra-compact cars.  The U.S. economic data “will temporarily weaken the
expectations for additional easing and is alleviating concerns
of the yen’s strength against the dollar, which is good for
exporters,” said Hiroichi Nishi, an equities manager in Tokyo
at SMBC Nikko Securities Inc.  The yen depreciated to as low as 78.90 against the dollar
today in Tokyo, compared with 78.45 at the close of  stock
trading , and weakened to 97.24 against the euro from 96.96. A
weaker yen boosts the value of overseas income at Japanese
companies when repatriated.  Just 29 of the Topix’s 1,672 companies are scheduled to
release earnings during this O-bon festival week. Of the 331
companies that have  reported  quarterly results since July 1, and
for which Bloomberg has estimates, 52 percent have missed
expectations.  Steel Makers  Steel makers were the biggest decliners on the Topix’s 33
industry groups after an official at Vale SA said China’s growth
is slowing. Nippon Steel Corp., Japan’s largest steelmaker, lost
2.4 percent to 163 yen.  Kobe Steel Ltd. (5406)  tumbled 5.7 percent to
66 yen, the second-biggest drop in the Nikkei 225, after its
stock price estimate was lowered to 75 yen from 100 yen by BNP
Paribas SA.  Sharp lost  the most  on the Nikkei 225, falling 12 percent
to 169 yen, after it said sales for liquid-crystal display
televisions will fall 35 percent, citing the end of government’s
eco-point program for a slump in demand. The electronics maker
had earlier forecast a 19 percent drop in sales. Deutsche Bank
AG cut the electronics maker’s equity rating to sell from hold.  -- With assistance from Masaaki Iwamoto in Tokyo. Editor:  Jim Powell   To contact the reporter on this story:
