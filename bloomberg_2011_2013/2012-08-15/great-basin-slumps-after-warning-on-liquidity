Great Basin Gold Ltd. (GBG) , a producer of
the metal in South Africa and  Nevada , plunged the most in more
than 23 years after warning that it’s running out of cash after
lower-than-expected production at the Burnstone mine.  Great Basin slid 43 percent to 25 Canadian cents at the
close in Toronto, the most  since  at least October 1988,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The company cut its 2012 production forecast and is facing
“near-term liquidity challenges,” Great Basin said in a
statement today. The company, which is based in Johannesburg and
has an office in  Vancouver , said it will seek to raise at least
C$60 million ($61 million) through a combination of asset sales
or new shares and has formed a special committee of directors to
run a strategic review process. Chief Executive Officer Ferdi Dippenaar resigned and Chief Financial Officer Lou Van Vuuren
was appointed interim CEO.  “We suspect the company will be unable to meet its
obligations beyond October,” Brad Humphrey, a Toronto-based
analyst at Raymond James Ltd., said in a note today. “The most
probable alternative is the sale of assets, likely the sale of
the Hollister mine in Nevada.”  Great Basin said it had a working capital deficit of about
C$23 million as of June 30. Its second-quarter loss widened to
C$22 million from C$1.1 million a year earlier. The company cut
its 2012 production forecast for Burnstone in  South Africa  to
30,000 ounces of gold from a previous range of 90,000 to 100,000
ounces.  The company also said it expects to produce 70,000 to
80,000 of so-called gold equivalent ounces at the Hollister mine
in Nevada. The previous forecast for Hollister was 90,000 to
100,000 ounces.  “The window for Great Basin to demonstrate it can turn
around operations has passed,” Josh Wolfson, a Toronto-based
analyst at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., said in a note today. He cut
his recommendation on the stock to sell from hold.  To contact the reporter on this story:
