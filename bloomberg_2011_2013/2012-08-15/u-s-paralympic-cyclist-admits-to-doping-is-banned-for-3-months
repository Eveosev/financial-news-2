Paralympic cyclist Monica Bascio, a
15-time American champion, was suspended for three months after
testing positive for a banned substance, the U.S. Anti-Doping
Agency said.  The 42-year-old from Evergreen,  Colorado , tested positive
for tuaminoheptane on May 26 at a Para-Cycling Road World Cup
event in  Rome  after taking an over-the-counter treatment, the
USADA said today in an e-mailed statement.  Although the drug is banned, an athlete can get a reduced
sanction when the source can be established and the athlete can
prove there was no intent to boost performance, the USADA said.  Bascio, who was paralyzed in a 1992 ski accident,
represented the U.S. at the 2006 and 2010 Paralympic Winter
Games in cross-country sit skiing.  A 15-time U.S. handcycling champion, she was planning to
compete in the Paralympics in London this year, according to a
story published on the Team USA website. Her suspension started
May 26.  The Paralympics start Aug. 29 in  London , and end Sept. 9.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
