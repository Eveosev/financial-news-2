South Korea ’s crude imports from
Iran fell 42 percent in July from a year earlier, the Customs
Service said.  The world’s fifth-largest oil buyer purchased 591,465
metric tons of oil, or about 140,000 barrels a day, from Iran
last month, compared with 1.02 million tons, or about 242,000
barrels daily, a year ago, according to  data  on the service’s
website today. Iran accounted for 5.5 percent of the total crude
supply in July, the figures showed. South Korean imports from
the Persian Gulf nation were 20 percent less than the 736,522
tons bought in June, according to the service.  South Korea won a renewable, 180-day exemption from U.S.
financial sanctions on its banks after it demonstrated it had
“significantly reduced” its purchases of Iranian oil. The East
Asian country failed to win a dispensation from a European Union
embargo that started July 1 that includes a ban on the insurance
of tankers carrying Iranian crude. Purchases slid 24 percent to
5.39 million tons in the first seven months of this year
compared with the same period in 2011.  Iran  has offered to use its own tankers to supply oil, a
South Korean government official said June 29, asking not to be
identified because the matter is confidential. SK Innovation Co.
and Hyundai Oilbank Co., the only buyers of Iranian crude in the
Asian country, are set to conclude talks with Iran to use its
vessels for imports, officials at the refiners said on Aug. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
