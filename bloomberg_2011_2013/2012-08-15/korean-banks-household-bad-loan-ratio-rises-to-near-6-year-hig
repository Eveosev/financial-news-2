South Korean banks’ ratio of soured
 household debt  to total lending in the category rose to almost a
six-year high in June as the country’s slowing economy weighed
on property values.  The ratio for all of the country’s 18 lenders jumped to
0.76 percent, the highest since September 2006, from 0.71
percent in March, the  Financial Supervisory Service  said in an
e-mailed statement today.  The FSS plans to toughen its quality review of loans
extended to households and industries vulnerable to further
economic slowdown caused by the  European debt crisis  or slowing
growth in  China , it said today. Financial Services Commission
Chairman Kim Seok Dong told lawmakers last month that while the
country’s household debt is manageable, problems overseas could
potentially threaten  South Korea ’s economy.  Banks’ bad-debt ratio for all loans narrowed to 1.49
percent in June from 1.51 percent at the end of March as banks
wrote off and sold non-performing loans, the regulator said. It
recommended banks set a target ratio of 1.3 percent for 2012.  The country’s lenders will submit their own target based on
the regulator’s recommendation, it said. The FSS defines non-
performing loans as debt past due by least three months.  Profit at the country’s banks sank 59 percent in the second
quarter as they booked additional provisions to weather the
government’s reduced growth forecast of 3 percent this year.  Loans newly classified as non-performing increased to 6.9
trillion won ($6.1 billion) in the April-June period, the most
since the third quarter of 2010, the FSS data shows. Total bad
debt stood at 20.8 trillion won at the end of June, compared
with 20.9 trillion won in March.  Woori Finance Holdings Co. (053000) ’s Woori Bank unit had 1.77
percent of bad loans out of its total credit as of June, the
highest among seven national lenders, according to the FSS
statement. The ratio for  Hana Financial Group Inc. (086790) ’s bank unit
was 1.03 percent, the lowest among the national banks.  To contact the reporter on this story:
