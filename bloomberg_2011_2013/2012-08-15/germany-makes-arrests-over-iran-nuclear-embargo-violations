German authorities arrested three
men charged with violating sanctions against  Iran  by delivering
parts bound for a nuclear reactor in the Islamic republic.  The Federal Prosecutor identified German and Iranian
nationals Kianzad Ka. and Gholamali Ka., plus a German citizen,
Rudolf M., as suspects, according to an  e-mailed statement . Some
90 officials made the arrests in Hamburg, Oldenburg and Weimar
today and carried out raids on an apartment and a business in
Halle in eastern Germany, the prosecutor said.  The three are under “acute” suspicion of violating
international sanctions against Iran put in place over the
country’s disputed nuclear program. The U.S. and its allies
accuse of Iran of harboring ambitions to build nuclear weapons,
while Iran has said its program is for peaceful purposes.  Germany ’s Karlsruhe-based prosecutor said the three
suspects conspired in 2010 and 2011 to deliver custom-built
valves for use in a heavy-water reactor in Iran. The accused
skirted export controls by identifying the recipients of the
supplies as firms in Turkey and  Azerbaijan , knowing that they
were in fact shell companies for a “middleman” of an Iranian
procurer, it said.  “The deliveries were part of a larger order worth several
million euros, which Iran tried to use to gain access to the
valve technology for the construction of the heavy-water
reactor,” the prosecutor said in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
