Taiwan ’s dollar declined the most
this week before government data that may show the island’s
export orders shrank for a fifth straight month in July as
demand from China and Europe waned.  A government report on Aug. 20 may show export orders
dropped 2.9 percent in July from a year earlier, following a 2.6
percent decline in June, according to the median forecast in a
Bloomberg survey. South Korea,  India  and Indonesia all reported
slides in overseas sales this month. Taiwan’s  economy  shrank in
the second quarter for the first time since 2009.  “The export slowdown is becoming a bit synchronized now
across  Asia ,” said Jackit Wong, an economist in  Hong Kong  at
Natixis Asia Ltd. “There is no sign of a recovery yet in
overseas demand so there isn’t much room for currencies to
appreciate.”  Taiwan’s dollar fell 0.1 percent to close at NT$30.002
against its U.S. counterpart, according to Taipei Forex Inc.
One-month implied volatility, a measure of exchange-rate swings
used to price options, was little changed at 3.40 percent.  The statistics office estimated on July 31 the island’s
gross domestic product declined 0.16 percent last quarter from a
year earlier. A final reading, to be published on Aug. 17, may
confirm the estimate, a Bloomberg News survey shows.  The yield on Taiwan’s 1.25 percent bonds due March 2022 was
steady at 1.18 percent, according to Gretai Securities Market.
The  overnight money-market rate  was little changed at 0.389
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Centre.  To contact the reporter on this story:
