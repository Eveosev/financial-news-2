Fox Networks President and Chief
Operating Officer David Haslingden will step down at the end of
the year to return to his native  Australia , the latest
management change before parent  News Corp. (NWSA)  splits in two.  Haslingden, 50, who has served as president of Fox Networks
since January 2011, plans to spend more time with his family,
News Corp. said today in a statement.  “My family is by far my greatest love, and being away from
them for almost two years is long enough,” Haslingden said in
the statement. “I’m delighted to be on my way home.”  News Corp. has made a number of executive changes since
announcing in June plans to split into separate publishing and
entertainment businesses. The company, led by  Rupert Murdoch ,
named Peter Rice chairman and chief executive officer of its
television business and moved David Hill from the head of Fox
Sports to a senior role in the corporate office in July.  Haslingden, who reported to Rice, helped expand News
Corp.’s international TV business to more than 350 channels in
over 55 countries, the company said. He oversaw business
development, finance, legal, ad sales and corporate functions,
according to the January 2011 announcement of his appointment.  “Since joining News Corporation, David has been a driving
force in the evolution of the pay-TV industry in every corner of
the world,”  Chase Carey , News Corp.’s president and chief
operating officer, said in the statement.  News Corp. rose 0.4 percent to $23.40 at the close in  New
York . The Class A shares have  gained  31 percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
