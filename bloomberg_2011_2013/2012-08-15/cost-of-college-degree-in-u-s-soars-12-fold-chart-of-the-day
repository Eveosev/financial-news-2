The cost of obtaining a university
education in the U.S. has soared 12 fold over the past three
decades, a sign the educational system is in need of reform,
according to lawmakers in both parties.  The CHART OF THE DAY shows college tuition and fees have
surged 1,120 percent since records began in 1978, four times
faster than the increase in the  consumer price index . Medical
expenses have climbed 601 percent, while the price of food has
increased 244 percent over the same period.  “Soaring tuition and shrinking incomes are making college
less and less affordable,” Senator  Tom Harkin , an Iowa Democrat
and chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions
Committee, said in an e-mailed statement. “For millions of
young people, rising college costs are putting the American
dream on hold, or out of reach.”  Pell grants , which are federal government funds given to
students showing financial need, and loan programs are
insufficient to address systemic problems in paying for higher
education, Harkin and top committee Republican  Mike Enzi  of
Wyoming said at a July 19 Congressional hearing on how to curb
the costs.  To contact the reporters on this story:
