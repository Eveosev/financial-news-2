VimpelCom Ltd. (VIP) , the world’s sixth-
biggest mobile phone provider, is looking to expand in
Uzbekistan after the country suspended the license of  OAO Mobile
TeleSystems’ (MBT)  local unit, Chief Executive Officer Jo Lunder said.  “We are seeing an increase in our subscriber base, it’s
pretty obvious,” Lunder said at a conference call with
investors and analysts today. “We think there are opportunities
there now and we want to take advantage of that.”  Uzbekistan extended a suspension of MTS’s local unit’s
license for three months from July 30 and may seek to cancel it,
Mobile TeleSystems, known as MTS, said in an Aug. 9 statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
