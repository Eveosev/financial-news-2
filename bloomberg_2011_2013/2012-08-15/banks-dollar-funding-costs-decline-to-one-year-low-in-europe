The cost for European banks to
borrow in dollars declined to the lowest in more than a year,
according to a money-markets indicator.  The three-month cross-currency  basis swap , the rate banks
pay to convert euro interest payments into U.S. dollars, was
32.5 basis points below the euro interbank offered rate, or
Euribor, at 9:16 a.m. in  London , from minus 35 basis points
yesterday. The cost is the lowest since July 22, 2011.  The one-year basis swap was little changed at 39 basis
points below Euribor, the lowest cost since Aug. 3, 2011,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. A basis point is 0.01
percentage point.  The three-month Eonia swap was little changed at 7.2 basis
points. The European Banking Federation’s euro overnight indexed
average of unsecured lending deals, known as Eonia, was set at
0.11 percent yesterday from 0.112 percent the day before.  Banks increased  overnight deposits  at the Frankfurt-based
 European Central Bank  to 329 billion euros ($406 billion)
yesterday, from 326 billion euros the day before.  To contact the reporter on this story:
