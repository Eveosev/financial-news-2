Doctors should be aware of the risks
of giving the painkiller codeine to children with a certain
genetic condition, following reports of three deaths and one
illness, the U.S.  Food and Drug Administration  said.  A safety review of the drug has been started and doctors
are being advised to use the lowest effective dose for the
shortest time necessary, the FDA said in  statement  today. The
move was taken after reports that three children died and one
experienced life-threatening breathing problems while taking
codeine after a tonsillectomy or surgery to relieve sleep apnea.  The children were “ultra-rapid metabolizers,” meaning
their bodies converted codeine into morphine faster and more
completely than normal. As many as seven in every 100 people may
have the condition, the FDA said in an  announcement . Codeine can
be sold as a single-ingredient product or in combination with
acetaminophen or aspirin.  The FDA is reviewing “adverse event reports and other
information to determine if there are additional cases of
inadvertent overdose or death in children taking codeine, and if
these adverse events occur during treatment of other kinds of
pain, such as post-operative pain following other types of
surgery or procedures,” said  Bob Rappaport , director of the
Division of Anesthesia, Analgesia and Addiction Products in
FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, in the statement.  Agency-cleared genetic tests can check for ultra-rapid
metabolism.  To contact the reporter on this story:
