Argentina’s  Consultatio (CTIO)  Asset
Management halted the presentation of an investment fund after
regulators ordered all funds to use the official exchange rate
to value foreign-currency assets, El Cronista reported.  The presentation of the new fund was scheduled for Aug. 16,
the Buenos Aires-based newspaper said, citing a statement by the
country’s Securities and Exchange Commission.  The new fund was suspended after regulators issued a
statement on Aug. 7 saying mutual funds couldn’t value
investment abroad at the so-called  blue chip  swap rate, which is
set by the difference in prices for securities in local markets
and overseas, El Cronista said. Consultatio had planned to use
that rate to value its new fund.  To contact the reporter on this story:
