Royal Mail  Group Ltd. will issue a
stamp to celebrate each U.K. national win at the Paralympic
Games in London beginning later this month.  “This will be the first time ever any host country has
issued Gold Medal stamps for their Paralympic winners since the
movement was founded in 1948,” the company said in a statement
on its website  today .  Royal Mail issued 29 stamps for each gold medal winner from
the U.K. during the  Olympic Games  that concluded on Aug. 12.  The U.K., or “Team GB,” won 42 gold medals in the last
Paralympics held in 2008 in Beijing. The games run from Aug. 29
until Sept. 9.  To contact the reporter on this story:
