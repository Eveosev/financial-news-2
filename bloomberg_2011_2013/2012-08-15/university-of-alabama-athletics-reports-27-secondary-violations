The  University of Alabama  reported
27 secondary rules violations in its athletic department over
the last year, more than half tied to improper phone calls or
text messages to recruits.  The Crimson Tide men’s basketball program was cited for six
violations, while women’s basketball and football committed four
infractions in the  annual report  of secondary violations listed
on the Tuscaloosa,  Alabama , school’s website. Women’s and men’s
tennis, track and field, gymnastics, baseball, softball, men’s
volleyball, soccer and the compliance department itself also
were cited.  The  National Collegiate Athletic Association  defines
secondary violations as isolated and inadvertent, and the
governing body expects schools to find and report them each
year, Erik Christianson, an NCAA spokesman, said in an e-mail.
The NCAA doesn’t comment on specific secondary violations,
Christianson said.  The violations don’t typically result in NCAA penalties.
Alabama listed corrective actions it took in each instance, such
as rules education, a letter of admonishment or temporary bans
on contact with recruits.  The Crimson Tide football team won its second national
championship in three years in January, beating Louisiana State
21-0.  To contact the reporter on this story:
