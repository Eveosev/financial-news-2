Six Japanese Coast Guard vessels
have surrounded a vessel from  Hong Kong  heading toward islands
claimed by both China and Japan.  The Hong Kong ship is about 27 nautical miles away from the
disputed islands in the  East China Sea , said Chan Miu-tak,
chairman of the Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu
Islands.  The Hong Kong activists were warned that they have entered
Japanese waters, and one of the Coast Guard vessels was
conducting water cannon drills, Chan said by phone.  The Hong Kong vessel was headed toward the disputed islands
to support Chinaâ€™s claims. The island chain is known as Diaoyu
in Chinese and Senkaku in Japanese.  To contact the reporter on this story:
