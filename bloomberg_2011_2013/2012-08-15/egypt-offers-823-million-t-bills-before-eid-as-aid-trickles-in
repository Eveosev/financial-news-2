Egypt sold  all 5 billion Egyptian
pounds ($823 million) of treasury bills if offered today at
higher yields as international aid starts to arrive. The dollar
bonds were little changed.  The Arab country raised 1 billion pounds of three-month
notes and 4 billion pounds of nine-month notes at the auction,
according to central bank data on Bloomberg. The nine-month
bills yield climbed 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point,
to 15.84 percent from the Aug. 5 sale of similar-maturity notes.
The average yield on the three-month notes rose five basis
points to 14.24 percent from the previous sale.  Egypt  is due to sign a $200 million loan agreement with the
 World Bank  this week, Prime Minister Hisham Qandil said Aug. 8.
The government also expects to receive $500 million of the $2
billion that Qatar agreed to deposit at the central bank before
the Islamic Eid holiday, Finance Minister Momtaz el-Saieed said
Aug. 12. The sale of  nine-month bills  was scrapped that day, the
first cancellation of a debt offering since May.  The International Monetary Fundâ€™s Managing Director
 Christine Lagarde  will visit Egypt next week, Qandil said
yesterday. Egypt will ask the IMF to raise a requested loan to
$4.8 billion from $3.2 billion, El-Saieed told reporters in
Cairo today. Loan talks are set to resume at the end of the
month after being stalled several times in the past year because
of changes in government.  The yield on the 5.75 percent dollar bonds due April 2020
were little changed at 6.2 percent at 2:45 p.m. in Cairo,
according to prices compiled by Bloomberg. The pound, subject to
a managed float, weakened 0.1 percent to 6.0780 a dollar.  Banks will be closed Aug. 19 and Aug. 20 for Eid, marking
the end of the holy month of Ramadan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
