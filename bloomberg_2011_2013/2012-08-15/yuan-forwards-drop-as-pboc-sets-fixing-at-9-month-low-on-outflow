Yuan  forwards declined the most in
five weeks as the central bank set the currency’s daily fixing
at a nine-month low after a report suggested capital flowed out
of the country last month.  The People’s Bank of  China  lowered the yuan’s  reference
rate  by 0.06 percent to 6.3482 per dollar today, the weakest
level since Nov. 30.  Yuan positions  at Chinese lenders
accumulated from sales of foreign exchange to the central bank
fell 3.8 billion yuan ($597 million) to 25.658 trillion yuan at
the end of July from a month earlier, the PBOC said on its
website yesterday.  “The yuan will continue to suffer from the cautious
atmosphere,” said Patrick Cheng, a Hong Kong-based foreign-
exchange analyst at Haitong International Securities Co.
“Investors are watching what China will do to revive growth.
It’ll take a while for those funds that have left to return.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards dropped 0.2 percent,
the most since July 9, to 6.4383 per dollar as of 4:31 p.m. in
 Hong Kong , data compiled by Bloomberg showed. The contracts
traded at a 1.2 percent discount to the onshore rate.  The yuan fell 0.06 percent to close at 6.3625 per dollar in
 Shanghai , according to the China Foreign Exchange Trade System.
That was the biggest drop since Aug. 3. The currency is allowed
to trade as much as 1 percent on either side of the central
bank’s daily fixing.  In Hong Kong’s offshore market, the yuan slipped 0.05
percent to 6.3680. One-month implied volatility, a measure of
exchange-rate swings used to price options, was steady at 1.25
percent.  China has left the  reserve ratio for the biggest banks  at
20 percent since mid-May while lowering  interest rates  in June
and July, bucking forecasts from HSBC Holdings Plc and Societe
Generale SA that the government would build on three ratio
reductions since November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
