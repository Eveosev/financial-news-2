Two men have been charged the murder
of oil company worker Carole Waugh, U.K. prosecutors said.  Rakesh Bhayani, 40, and Nicholas David Kutner, 47, had
earlier been charged with conspiracy to commit fraud before
being charged with the murder of 50-year-old Waugh today, London
police said in a statement.  Waugh was reported missing by her family on May 7 and her
body was found inside a car in a London garage on Aug. 7. The
 Metropolitan Police Service  said Waugh was in between jobs at
the time of her disappearance and had worked in the oil and
banking industries as a financial manager and executive.  Bhayani and Kutner will appear at Croydon Magistrates’
Court tomorrow.  “I have today authorized the Metropolitan Police Service
to charge Rakesh Bhayani and Nicholas Kutner with murder between
15 and 19 April 2012,” the Crown Prosecution Service’s London
Head of Homicide Daren Streeter said in a statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
