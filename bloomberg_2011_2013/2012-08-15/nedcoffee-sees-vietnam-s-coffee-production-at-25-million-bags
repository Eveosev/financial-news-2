Coffee production in  Vietnam , the
world’s largest producer of robusta beans, will be about 25
million bags in the 2011-12 season ending in September,
according to Dutch trader  Nedcoffee BV .  Output in the previous season was 19.5 million bags, the
U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Vietnam has exported
about 1.24 million tons, or 20.64 million bags, from the start
of the season in October through to July, said the trader, which
has offices in the Southeast Asian nation. A bag of coffee
weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Farmers in Vietnam are still holding back 2.4 percent of
the 2011-12 crop, Nedcoffee said in a report e-mailed today.
Coffee collectors, middlemen and private millers in the Central
Highlands, the country’s main growing region, are holding
another 2 percent, according to the report.  In  Indonesia , the third-biggest robusta grower, about 64
percent of the robusta crop in southern Sumatra, the main
growing area, was harvested by the end of last week, the
Amsterdam-based trader said.  About 87 percent of the beans gathered have been delivered
to Bandar Lampung. Deliveries in the past four-week period
totaled 47,000 tons, the highest for the period in four years,
it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
