Venezuelan President  Hugo Chavez 
said his country will allow the U.S. to “have contact” with a
American citizen taken into custody by security forces who is
suspected of being a mercenary.  The communication will take place today after the U.S.
requested a meeting, Chavez said according to an e-mailed
government statement yesterday. The Venezuelan leader didn’t say
whether U.S. officials would meet with the man in person.  “We’re going to cooperate and hopefully they will
cooperate with us,” the statement cites Chavez as saying.
“We’ve received a positive signal, they’ve said they want to
cooperate.”  Chavez said Aug. 9 that  Venezuela  captured a U.S. citizen
attempting to enter the South American country illegally from
 Colombia . The man of Hispanic origin had passport stamps showing
he’d visited Iraq, Afghanistan and  Libya , and tore up a notebook
containing coordinates while being arrested, Chavez said.  During questioning, the man said he was a former marine,
Chavez said a day later. Venezuelan officials contacted the
State Department directly about the case, U.S. State Department
spokeswoman  Victoria Nuland  said Aug. 13.  Chavez, who faces elections on Oct. 7 and wants to extend
his 13 years in power with another six-year term, often points
to an attempted coup in 2002 as evidence that the U.S. and his
domestic opponents are planning to overthrow him. The self-
declared socialist has said that the opposition may react
violently to losing the elections and that the arrest “obliges
us to activate all the alarms.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
