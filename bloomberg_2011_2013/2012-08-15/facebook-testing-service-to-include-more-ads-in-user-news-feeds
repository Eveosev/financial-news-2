Facebook Inc. (FB) , owner of the world’s
most popular social network, is testing an advertising service
that lets companies cast a wider net by placing more promotional
messages in users’ News Feeds.  Under the program, companies can place ads in users’ main
feeds on smartphones and personal computers even if those
members or their friends haven’t signaled they like the
advertiser, said Annie Ta, a spokeswoman for Facebook. Until
now, these types of ads only showed up on PCs to the right of
the Facebook News Feed, which displays activities by friends and
companies or groups a user has “Liked.”  Facebook is grappling with investor concerns about its
growth prospects as more users access the service from wireless
devices, where its advertising options have been limited.
Facebook rolled out its first mobile ad service for companies
earlier this year with “Sponsored Stories,” enabling companies
to pay for content in the News Feed after members or their
friends have indicated they like a company.  The new test service includes limits so that a member’s
News Feed isn’t filled with too many advertisements, Ta said.
The test is the company’s third major effort in mobile
advertising. Earlier this month, Facebook unveiled a tool that
helps developers advertise their wares.  Facebook rose 4 percent to $21.20 today at the  New York 
close. The stock has dropped 44 percent since its May 17 initial
public offering.  The website  Inside Facebook  earlier reported the test of
the service.  To contact the reporter on this story:
