Russian billionaire  Alexander
Lebedev  asked the government to resume talks about buying out
his stake in OAO Aeroflot,  Vedomosti  reported, citing a letter
from Lebedev to Prime Minister  Dmitry Medvedev .  The businessman is ready to sell his 14.5 percent stake in
the state-run carrier at about $1.30 a share, the newspaper
said. He also wants to sell a 26 percent stake in Ilyushin
Finance, an aviation-leasing company; state-run VEB has declined
to buy him out, Vedomosti said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
