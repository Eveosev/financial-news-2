Far East  Organization, Singaporeâ€™s
biggest closely held developer, raised S$656.3 million ($526
million) in an initial public offering of a hotel trust, three
people with knowledge of the matter said.  Far East Hospitality Trust plans to sell 705.7 million
stapled securities at 93 Singapore cents apiece, the top end of
a marketed range, the people said, asking not to be named as the
information is private. The units were offered at 86 cents to 93
cents, according to a prospectus filed with the Monetary
Authority of Singapore this month.  The IPO is the biggest this year in Singapore, where $785
million has been raised in such sales so far in 2012 compared
with $7 billion in the first seven months of 2011, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  Ascendas Hospitality Trust (ASHT)  started
trading in the city last month after raising S$459 million.  A stapled security allows investors to purchase both a
trust and a related company. The Far East Hospitality units
comprise a real estate investment trust and a business trust,
according to the listing prospectus.  Far East Hospitality will initially include 11 properties,
according to the offering document. Among these are seven
hotels, including Albert Court Village Hotel and Orchard Parade
Hotel, as well as four serviced residences. Far East Hospitality
forecasts a dividend yield of as much as 6.5 percent for 2012.  DBS Group Holdings Ltd., HSBC Holdings Plc and Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. are managing the IPO. The Wall Street Journal
reported the pricing earlier today, citing unidentified people.
An outside spokeswoman for Far East Organization had no comment
on the pricing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
