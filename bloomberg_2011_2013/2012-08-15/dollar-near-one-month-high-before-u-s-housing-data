The yen slid versus all its major
counterparts as Asian stocks rose and the extra yield investors
receive from U.S. securities climbed to the most in four months,
damping the allure of Japan’s currency.  The dollar touched a one-month high against the yen before
U.S. housing data that may curtail prospects for monetary
stimulus by the  Federal Reserve  that tends to debase the
greenback. Reports due today may show new  home construction 
remained near an almost four-year high and building permits
increased. New Zealand’s dollar held gains after Fonterra
Cooperative Group Ltd. said milk-powder prices rose. The
Philippine peso fell to a seven-week low versus the greenback.  “When non-Japanese yields start rising, then you get more
Japanese investors putting money offshore,” said  Joseph Capurso , a strategist in Sydney at  Commonwealth Bank of
Australia. (CBA)  This and low volatility are “very supportive of the
yen’s weakness,” he said.  The yen fell 0.4 percent to 79.29 per dollar as of 7:15
a.m. in  London  after earlier touching 79.36, the weakest since
July 13. It slid for a fourth day against Europe’s shared
currency, dropping 0.2 percent to 97.27 per euro from 97.08
yesterday. The euro was at $1.2269 from $1.2290.  The  MSCI Asia Pacific Index (MXAP)  of shares climbed 0.5 percent.  Five-year  U.S. government debt  offered a  premium  of 60
basis points over its Japanese counterpart, the most since April
9. The  difference  between yields on two-year U.S. Treasuries and
similar maturity Japanese government notes was 19 basis points,
the most since July 3.  Treasury Buyers  Investors in  Japan  bought $10.4 billion of Treasuries in
June, bringing their purchases for 2012 to $61.3 billion and
total holdings of the debt to $1.1193 trillion, Treasury data
released yesterday show.  That compares with China’s addition of $300 million to its
portfolio of U.S. government securities for the month, raising
its purchases this year to $12.4 billion and its stake in
Treasuries to $1.1643 trillion. Should both countries continue
buying at their respective paces through 2012, Japan will end
the year with more Treasuries.  The Japanese currency has declined 0.6 percent in the past
week, the worst performance among 10 major currencies tracked by
Bloomberg Correlation-Weighted Indexes after the Australian
dollar. The greenback gained 0.4 percent, while the euro rose
0.1 percent.  U.S. Housing  The annual pace for U.S. housing starts was probably at
756,000 in July, according to the median estimate of economists
 surveyed  by Bloomberg News before today’s Commerce Department
report. That compares with a 760,000 rate in the previous month,
the fastest since October 2008. The rate for building permits
may have climbed to 769,000 last month from 760,000 in June, a
separate  poll  showed.  The U.S. central bank has held its target for overnight
lending in a range of zero to 0.25 percent since 2008 and plans
to keep it there at least through late 2014 to stimulate the
world’s biggest economy. The Fed also bought $2.3 trillion of
mortgage and Treasury debt from 2008 to 2011 in two rounds of
quantitative easing, also known as QE1 and QE2.  “The reason the  U.S. dollar  has been strengthening is that
the data hasn’t been too bad,” CBA’s Capurso said. “The market
has started to take out a little bit of pricing for QE3 in the
near term.”  Dallas Fed President  Richard Fisher  said in a CNBC
interview yesterday that the  U.S. economy  probably won’t lapse
into recession in 2013 and that new stimulus wouldn’t spur
growth.  Milk Prices  New Zealand’s currency was supported after whole-milk
powder prices climbed for a second-straight time at auction,
according to Auckland-based Fonterra, the world’s largest dairy
exporter. The price for October delivery rose 7.3 percent an
trade-weighted index on the company’s GlobalDairyTrade website
showed. The company accounts for about 40 percent of the global
trade in dairy products.  The  New Zealand dollar  bought 80.63 U.S. cents after
gaining 0.2 percent to 80.71 yesterday, its biggest advance
since Aug. 3.  The Philippine currency weakened a central bank report
yesterday showed  remittances  climbed 4.2 percent in June from a
year earlier, the least in 15 months. The peso lost 0.3 percent
to 42.375 per dollar, the weakest since June 29, according to
Tullett Prebon Plc prices showed.  To contact the reporters on this story:
