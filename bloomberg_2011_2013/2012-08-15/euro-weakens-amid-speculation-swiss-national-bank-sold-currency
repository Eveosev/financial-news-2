The euro weakened on speculation the
 Swiss National Bank  sold the currency amid an increase in its
foreign-exchange holdings to a record last month.  “I’ve heard that a bank has been working with the SNB
selling euros against the pound,” said  Jeremy Stretch , head of
foreign-exchange strategy at  Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce 
in  London . “In this instance it’s against the pound, but the
selling pressure of euros in general is acting as a negative on
the currency as a whole, so all the euro crosses are lower,
including euro-dollar.”  Silvia Oppliger, a Zurich-based SNB spokeswoman, declined
to comment.  The euro weakened as much as 0.5 percent against the pound
to 78.25 pence, and was at 78.28 pence at 1:53 p.m. in London.
It fell 0.4 percent to $1.2276, depreciating against all but one
of its 16 major peers tracked by Bloomberg.  The Swiss central bank’s foreign-currency reserves swelled
11.3 percent in July to 406.5 billion Swiss francs ($416
billion), it said on Aug. 7. Walter Meier, an SNB spokesman in
Zurich, said then that “a large part” of the increase resulted
from currency purchases to defend the minimum  exchange rate .  SNB President Thomas Jordan has pledged to enforce the
franc cap of 1.20 per euro “with unlimited purchases of foreign
currencies if needed.” The central bank implemented the policy
in September to fight deflation and help exporters.  To contact the reporters on this story:
