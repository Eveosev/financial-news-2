First Bank of Nigeria Plc , the
country’s third-biggest lender by market value, rose to the
highest in more than a year on speculation it will continue to
increase profit.  The stock gained 2.2 percent to 12.37 naira by the close in
Lagos,  Nigeria ’s commercial capital, its highest since July
2011. First Bank shares have risen by 39 percent this year,
compared with an 11 percent increase in the Nigerian Stock
Exchange All-Share Index.  Profit for the six months through June more than doubled to
46 billion naira ($293 million) from 20.5 billion naira a year
earlier, the Lagos-based lender said on July 24. Revenue rose to
182.3 billion naira from 145.1 billion naira.  “Investors are pricing the impact of First Bank’s strong
earnings accretion and cost savings into the share price,”
Abiola Rasaq, a Lagos-based analyst at Vetiva Capital Management
Ltd., said in a phone interview. ‘From a valuation perspective,
we believe our year-end target price of 13.67 naira is water-
tight, especially as we see upside for a full-year 2012 profit-
after estimate of 75 billion naira.”  Vetiva has an “accumulate” recommendation on the stock,
Rasaq said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
