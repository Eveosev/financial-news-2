American International Group Inc. (AIG) 
extended its streak of gains to the longest since March as John Griffin’s  Blue Ridge  Capital LLC and  Daniel Loeb ’s Third Point
LLC disclosed stakes in the bailed-out insurer.  Blue Ridge added 10.4 million shares of New York-based AIG
in the quarter ended June 30, according to a filing yesterday.
Third Point had a new stake of 2.25 million shares, it said in a
filing. Loeb’s fund had $8.9 billion under management as of July
31, according to its  website .  AIG jumped 1.4 percent to $34.29 at 10:03 a.m. in New York,
heading for its ninth straight daily advance since reporting a
profit gain after the close of regular trading on Aug. 2. The
 U.S. Treasury  sold $5.75 billion of AIG shares in May and an
equal amount this month, cutting its stake to 53 percent. AIG
trades for about 57 percent of  book value , a measure of assets
minus liabilities.  “The company is on a positive track, continuing to move
forward in its turnaround,” Gloria Vogel, an analyst at Drexel
Hamilton LLC, wrote in an Aug. 6 research note. “The repurchase
of shares at a significant discount to book value helps to raise
earnings” per share. She has a  buy rating  on AIG.  Leon Cooperman ’s Omega Advisors Inc. tripled its AIG stake
in the three months ended June 30 to 4.59 million shares, an
Aug. 13  filing  shows. Omega has earned an average of about 13
percent annually since it was founded in 1991, according to
Chicago-based Hedge Fund Research Inc.  Bruce Berkowitz ’s Fairholme Capital Management LLC is the
largest owner of AIG shares after the U.S. government, with
about 88 million, according to  data  compiled by Bloomberg.  “Our best idea remains AIG,” Berkowitz wrote in a  letter 
to investors posted on his website. “There are few occasions
when systemically important franchises sell for half of book
value and are profitable. This is one of those times.”  AIG has rallied 48 percent this year, beating the 12
percent climb of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index. The insurer
dropped 52 percent in 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
