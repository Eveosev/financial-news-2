New York City  may not stage an
 Ironman triathlon  next year after a competitor drowned in the
Hudson River during the inaugural event two days ago, the New
York Times reported.  Registration for the 2013 race was suspended yesterday, the
newspaper said, citing Shane Facteau, Ironman’s vice president
for North American operations.  Refunds will be given to early registrants who paid $1,200,
a 37 percent increase over this year’s fee of $825, Facteau told
the Times.  A decision on whether to reopen registration will be made
in four to six weeks, Facteau told the newspaper.  The Ironman consists of a 2.4-mile swim (3.9 kilometers),
112-mile bike ride and 26.2-mile run.  To contact the reporter on this story:
