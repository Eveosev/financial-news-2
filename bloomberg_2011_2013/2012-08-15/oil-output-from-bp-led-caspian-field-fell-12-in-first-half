Production of crude oil from the BP
Plc-led Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in Azerbaijanâ€™s section of
the  Caspian Sea  fell in the first half of the year, the U.K.
energy producer said by e-mail today.  The field, also known as ACG, produced 16.8 million metric
tons of oil in January through June, a decline of 11.58 percent
from a year earlier, the BP office in the Azeri capital of Baku
said, without giving a reason for the decline.  Output from the offshore natural-gas field of Shah Deniz,
also led by BP, grew 9.4 percent to 3.36 billion cubic meters,
the company said.  Azerbaijan, the third largest oil producer in the former
Soviet Union, decreased oil production 7.1 percent to 22.2
million tons in the first half of the year, the State Statistics
Committee said last month. Production of marketable gas expanded
8.6 percent to 8.8 billion cubic meters.  The biggest oil producer in the former  Soviet Union  is
 Russia , followed by  Kazakhstan .  To contact the reporter on this story:
