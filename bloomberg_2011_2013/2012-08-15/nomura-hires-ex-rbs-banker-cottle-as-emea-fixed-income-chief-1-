Nomura Holdings Inc. (8604)  hired Gary Cottle, formerly of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS) , as its
head of fixed income for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.  Cottle is based in London, where he reports to Steve Ashley, the global head of fixed income, and EMEA Chief
Executive Officer John Phizackerley, the bank said in a
statement. Cottle replaces Georges Assi, who left at the end of
July to take a break from banking.  Nomura is also building its fixed-income business in other
parts of the world, hiring Jon Linton in Sydney as head of macro
products for Australia, according to today’s statement. Linton
was formerly at RBS and reports to Yutaka Nakajima, Nomura’s
head of fixed-income trading for Japan and Australia, said  Rob Davies , a spokesman for the Tokyo-based lender.  Cottle was a board member at RBS’s investment bank and
global head of sales for corporate and government clients. His
career includes stints at Morgan Stanley and Barclays Plc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
