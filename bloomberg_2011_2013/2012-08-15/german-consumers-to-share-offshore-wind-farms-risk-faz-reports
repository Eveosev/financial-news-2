Germany wants power consumers to
share the financial risk of sea-based wind farms and their links
to the electricity grid,  Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung 
reported, citing draft regulations from the  Economy Ministry .  Consumers are to pay for most of the costs if developers
canâ€™t sell their power because of grid failures, the newspaper
says. The regulation is intended to spark investments into wind
farms and grid projects, FAZ said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
