Scott Allen , a former Mercer LLC
investment adviser, is seeking a noncustodial term of probation
or home confinement or both, saying he cooperated with the U.S.
on several investigations.  Allen pleaded guilty in March to supplying nonpublic
information to a friend in a $2.6 million insider-trading scheme
involving drug-company acquisitions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
