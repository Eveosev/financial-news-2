Canadian stocks advanced for the
second day after U.S. industrial production rose and investors
awaited signs of whether the  Federal Reserve  and  European
Central Bank  would act to spur economic growth.  Royal Bank of Canada (RY)  and  Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD)  advanced at
least 0.6 percent. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc., the
world’s largest fertilizer producer, climbed 0.9 percent. Bank
shares contributed most to gains on the  Standard & Poor’s/TSX
Composite Index. (SPTSX)   The S&P/TSX gained 51.83 points, or 0.4 percent, to
11,905.44. The gauge added 0.6 percent in the past two days.  “People are positioning themselves for a potential
solution out of Europe by buying the financial stocks,” Brian Huen, who helps manage C$55 million at Toronto-based Red Sky
Capital Management Ltd., said in phone interview.  Industrial production in the U.S. rose in July, led by a
pick-up in motor vehicle output and a rebound in utility use
during the hottest month on record. In a separate report by the
Federal Reserve Bank of New York, manufacturing in the New York
area contracted in August for the first time in 10 months.  The Federal Open Market Committee on Aug. 1 reiterated its
pledge to ease policy further if necessary, and ECB President
 Mario Draghi  promised last month that policy makers will do
whatever is needed to preserve the euro. Investors are awaiting
Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke ’s speech Aug. 31 at the Kansas City
conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and an ECB meeting next
month for more direction.  Banks Gain  Royal Bank, the country’s largest lender, gained 1.4
percent to C$52.72. Toronto-Dominion Bank advanced 0.6 percent
to C$79.79.  Bank of Montreal (BMO)  added 0.4 percent to C$57.33.  Gold companies advanced as the metal rose 0.3 percent to
settle at $1,606.60 an ounce on the Comex in New York.  Osisko
Mining Corp. (OSK) , which holds interest in the Canadian Malartic gold
deposit in Quebec, added 2.5 percent to C$9.28.  Barrick Gold
Corp. (ABX) , the largest producer of the metal, rose 1.1 percent to
C$34.26. New Gold Inc. advanced 2.5 percent to C$10.20.  Great Basin Gold Ltd., a producer of the metal in South
Africa and Nevada, plunged 43 percent to 25 cents, the most in
almost 24 years. It warned investors it’s running out of cash
after lower-than-expected production at the Burnstone mine. It
will seek to raise at least C$60 million ($61 million) through a
combination of asset sales or new shares. Chief Executive
Officer Ferdi Dippenaar resigned.  Connacher Oil and Gas Ltd. (CLL) , the oilsands company that has
retained Goldman Sachs Group Inc. to explore stategic options,
fell 9.3 percent to 39 cents after agreeing to sell a Montana
refinery.  Potash Corp. increased 0.9 percent to C$43.28.  Agrium Inc. (AGU) ,
the largest farm retailer in the U.S., added 1.9 percent to
C$97.70. The company met with Jana Partners LLC and other
shareholders today after rejecting the hedge fund’s proposal for
Agrium to spin off its retail unit, according to two people
familiar with the situation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
