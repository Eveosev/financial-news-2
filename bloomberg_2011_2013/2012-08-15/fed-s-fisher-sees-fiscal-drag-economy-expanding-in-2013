Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas
President  Richard Fisher  said the  U.S. economy  probably won’t
lapse into recession in 2013 and that new stimulus wouldn’t spur
growth.  “I don’t believe any amount of  monetary stimulus  is going
to deal with this uncertainty and inability of companies to
budget, to plan” due to the lack of clarity in fiscal policy,
Fisher said today in an interview on CNBC. He said he doesn’t
see a “high likelihood” of a recession next year.  The Dallas Fed chief in 2011 dissented twice against moves
to push down long-term rates and to keep the benchmark U.S.
interest rate near zero until at least mid-2013. He voted five
times in 2008 in favor of tighter policy. This year he isn’t a
voting member of the  Federal Open Market Committee , which is
scheduled to meet Sept. 12-13.  Fisher, 63, said what is needed is regulatory clarity and
fiscal policy certainty from Congress. Businesses are in a
“defensive crouch,” he said.  The Fed on Aug. 1 said it will “closely monitor” economic
data and financial developments and provide more stimulus if
needed. The central bank also said it will continue swapping
$667 billion of short-term debt with longer-term securities to
lengthen the average maturity of its holdings, an action dubbed
Operation Twist.  To contact the reporters on this story:
