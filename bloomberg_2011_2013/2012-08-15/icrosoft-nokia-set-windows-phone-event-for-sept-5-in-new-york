Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  and  Nokia Oyj (NOK1V)  sent
out invitations for a Sept. 5 press conference in New York to
discuss Nokia’s Lumia brand Windows Phones.  Nokia will also be holding its Nokia World event that day
in Helsinki. The companies plan to announce Windows Phone 8-
based handsets next month, ahead of an expected Sept. 12
unveiling of Apple Inc.’s next iPhone, a person with knowledge
of the matter said last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
