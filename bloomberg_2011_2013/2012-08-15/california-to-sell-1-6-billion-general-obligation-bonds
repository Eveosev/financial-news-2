California plans to sell $1.6
billion in general-obligation bonds on Sept. 25, Treasurer Bill Lockyer said in an e-mailed statement.  The debt will include $1.3 billion for infrastructure
projects and $300 million to refinance existing bonds, according
to  Tom Dresslar , Lockyer’s spokesman.  The state also plans a $500 million sale Oct. 23 to
refinance general-obligation bonds, Dresslar said in a
statement.  The most populous state has reduced borrowing as part of
Governor  Jerry Brown ’s attempt to rein in persistent deficits.
Before today’s announcement, general-obligation borrowing in
2011 and 2012 totaled $11.5 billion, the least for a two-year
period since 2006, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  The State Public Works Board has scheduled a $250 million
sale of lease-revenue bonds Sept. 13 for the  University of
California  and California State University systems, and $548
million on Oct. 17 for various state projects, according to
Dresslar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
