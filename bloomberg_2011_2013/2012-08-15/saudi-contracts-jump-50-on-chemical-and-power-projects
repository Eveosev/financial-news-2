The number of awarded contracts in
 Saudi Arabia  jumped by 50 percent in the first half of 2012, led
by petrochemical and power projects, according to  National
Commercial Bank .  The country awarded construction contracts worth 126.7
billion riyals ($33.8 billion) in the first six months compared
with 84.3 billion riyals a year earlier, NCB said today in an e-
mailed report. Petrochemical and power projects comprised 67
billion riyals, or 53 percent, of the contracts, said the bank,
the kingdom’s largest by assets.  “Although 2011 was considered to be a remarkable year in
the construction sector, it appears that 2012 will continue this
positive trend,” the Jeddah-based lender said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
