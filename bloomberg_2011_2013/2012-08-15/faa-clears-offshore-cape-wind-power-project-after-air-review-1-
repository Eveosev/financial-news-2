The Federal Aviation Administration
said the proposed Cape Wind power project off the Massachusetts
coast poses no risk to air navigation, clearing a hurdle for
what may be the first U.S. offshore wind facility.  The agency determined that 130  wind turbines  in the
Nantucket Sound won’t affect planes in the area, according to a
 statement  today.  “Having sold more than three quarters of its power in
long-term Power Purchase Agreements with Massachusetts electric
utilities, Cape Wind has commenced its project financing
stage,”  Mark Rodgers , Cape Wind Associates LLC’s communications
director, said in separate statement.  Construction on the 468-megawatt wind farm, which will
consist of turbines made by  Siemens AG (SIE) , has been planned for
more than a decade and may begin as early as next year, Cape
Wind Associates said on June 26. The project has been opposed by
the Kennedy family, which owns a compound that overlooks the
sound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
