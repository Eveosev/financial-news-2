Sharp Corp. (6753) , the worst  performer  on
the  Nikkei 225 (NKY)  Stock Average with a 75 percent plunge this year,
fell to the lowest level almost 38 years after Deutsche Bank AG
cut its rating on concern  cash flow  won’t cover funding needs.  Sharp dropped 12 percent to 169 yen, the lowest level since
at least September 1974, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Deutsche
cut its  recommendation  to sell from hold and expects the stock
to fall to 110 yen during the next 12 months, it said in a
report dated yesterday.  Japan ’s biggest liquid-crystal display panel maker had
362.5 billion yen ($4.6 billion) in  commercial paper , compared
with cash and savings of 217.7 billion yen, as of June 30,
according to its earnings statement released Aug. 2. Sharp, the
maker of Aquos TVs, is cutting 5,000 jobs after widening its
annual loss forecast eightfold because of slumping demand for
its sets.  The commercial paper will “be covered by increased short-
term borrowings, and note that this level of funds cannot be
covered from cash flow,” Yasuo Nakane, a Tokyo-based analyst at
 Deutsche (DBK) , said in the report. “We cannot deny the risk of
larger losses than we have estimated, with further structural
reforms and radical business plan review pressuring the firm to
post inventory valuation losses and reductions in deferred tax
assets.”  Sharp expects a net loss of 250 billion yen for the year
ending March 31, it said Aug. 2.  Goldman  Sharp had its  credit rating  cut by one level to BBB at
 Standard & Poor’s  on Aug. 3. That’s the second lowest among
S&P’s 10 scales of investment grades. Sharp has 200 billion yen
of convertible bonds maturing in September 2013, data compiled
by Bloomberg show.  “Relying heavily on commercial papers may not be a viable
approach given that its credit rating has fallen due to
deteriorating earnings,”  Takashi Watanabe , a Tokyo-based
analyst at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., said in a report yesterday.  Sharp would need to raise between 300 billion yen and 400
billion yen to prepare for redemption of commercial papers and
convertible bonds next year, he said.  Goldman cut its 12-month price target on Sharp shares to
190 yen from 260 yen to reflect the lower earnings estimate.  Foxconn Technology Group, maker of  Apple Inc. (AAPL)  iPads, said
Aug. 3 it plans to renegotiate the price of its planned
investment in Sharp. Foxconn agreed in March to buy 9.9 percent
of the Osaka-based company for 67 billion yen, or 550 yen per
share. Sharp is trading about 69 percent below that price as of
today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
