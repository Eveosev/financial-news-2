Paladin Energy Ltd. (PDN) , the Australian
company producing uranium in Africa, gained the most in seven
months in Sydney trading after signing a six-year supply deal
with an unidentified utility.  The shares  rose 10 percent to A$1.39, the biggest gain
since Jan. 17, while Australia’s benchmark S&P/ASX 200 Index
declined 0.3 percent.  Paladin, operator of the Langer Heinrich mine in  Namibia 
and the Kayelekera project in Malawi, will receive an initial
$200 million payment, allowing the company to repay debt, the
Perth-based company said today in a statement. The company,
which is developing assets in Australia,  Canada  and Niger,
forecasts that uranium prices will climb this year.  Paladin will deliver 13.73 million pounds of uranium oxide
to the utility starting in 2019 from its mines in  Africa  or a
project yet to be developed, the company said. It will use the
$200 million to repay its $134 million in convertible bonds due
next year, according to the statement.  The utility will hold 60.1 percent of Paladin’s Michelin
project in Canada as security, with that stake lowered as
Paladin continues work on the venture, the company said. The
payment to Paladin will be made in tranches to be completed by
Jan 31, 2013, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
