The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority said it expelled WJB Capital Group Inc. for misstating
its financial records and for engaging in securities
transactions while it was below its required net capital.  FINRA also said it barred the firm’s chief executive
officer, Craig A. Rothfeld, from the securities industry, and
barred the firm’s chief financial officer, Gregory S. Maleski,
from acting in a principal capacity.  “Both WJB’s CEO and CFO hid the precarious financial
condition of the firm, misstating the FOCUS reports and net
capital calculations by as much as $4.4 million per month over a
two-year period,” Brad Bennett, FINRA Chief of Enforcement,
said today in a statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
