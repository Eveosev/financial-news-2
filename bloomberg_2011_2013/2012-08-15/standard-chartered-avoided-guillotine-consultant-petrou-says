Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner
of Federal Financial Analytics Inc., comments on Bloomberg
Television about  Standard Chartered  Plc’s $340 million
settlement of a New York money-laundering probe. Petrou is co-
founder of the Washington-based consulting firm.  Standard Chartered still faces federal inquiries over
claims it helped sanctioned nations including Iran illegally
funnel money through the U.S. Regulators including the  U.S.
Treasury , Federal Reserve, Justice Department and Manhattan
District Attorney declined attempts at a global settlement, said
two people familiar with the matter.  “The New York regulator held the guillotine and Standard
Chartered decided to keep its neck out of it.  ‘‘This isn’t over. This is the first shoe to drop; there
are other shoes and the costs could well mount.  ‘‘Next to come are the federal inquiries and the criminal
inquiries, and possibly additional action from the state of New
York.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
