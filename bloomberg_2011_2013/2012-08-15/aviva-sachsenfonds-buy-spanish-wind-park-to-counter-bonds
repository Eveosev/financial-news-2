Aviva Plc (AV/) ’s asset management unit
and SachsenFonds GmbH, a German investor, bought a 49.4-megawatt
Spanish wind farm from Element Power US LLC to help offset lower
returns on bonds.  The insurer’s Aviva Investors business and SachsenFonds
bought the Almatret wind farm in Lerida, Catalonia, for an
undisclosed sum, according to an e-mailed statement. The park
started production in 2010 using 25 turbines made by Denmark’s
 Vestas Wind Systems A/S. (VWS)   Insurers and pension funds are seeking alternative assets
after a decline in  interest rates  reduced yields on bonds and
equity-market volatility increased. Wind farms, promoted by
European nations with climate goals and supported by subsidy
programs, operate for about 25 years, offering steady gains for
institutions.  “In a challenging macro economic environment where yields
remain low, especially on  government bonds , institutional
investors are looking for diversified sources of stable
income,” Ian Berry,  fund manager  for infrastructure and
renewable energy at Aviva Investors, said in the statement.  Element Power, a Portland-based developer backed by Hudson
Clean Energy Partners, has more than 7,650 megawatts of
operating and development-stage wind and solar assets globally.  To contact the reporter on this story:
