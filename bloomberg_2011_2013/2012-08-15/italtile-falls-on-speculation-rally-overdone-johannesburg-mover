Italtile Ltd. (ITE)  fell the most in
almost seven months on a technical signal the shares would drop
and amid speculation a 25 percent gain this year was overdone.  The ceramic-tile retailer dropped 6.2 percent, the most
since Jan. 24, to 6.10 rand by the close in Johannesburg.  Italtile’s  relative-strength index  advanced to 85
yesterday, above the 70 level that signals a stock is due to
decline. Before today’s decline, the company had climbed 13
percent since issuing a trading statement on Aug. 6 saying
profit would be 17 percent to 19 percent higher, pushing shares
to the most expensive since November 2007. Earnings per share
increased 18 percent to 41.1 cents, the company said in a
statement today.  “The multiple is trading around 16 times earnings; it’s
fairly high for Italtile,” Anton Solomons, a retail analyst at
Thebe Stockbroking Pty Ltd., said by phone from Johannesburg.
“The market is seeing a lot of the earnings growth has been
captured in the share price.”  Sales in the year through June increased 16 percent to 3.52
billion rand ($429 million). Profit margins narrowed as price
increases were kept below inflation, even after higher energy
costs and currency volatility, the company said.  The company’s RSI, which measures how rapidly the stock
rose or fell, retreated to 58 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
