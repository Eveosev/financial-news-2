Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad’s
government is sending Iranian weapons to Kurdistan Workers’
Party, or PKK, rebels attacking Turkey,  Zaman newspaper  cited
U.S. Ambassador to Turkey Francis Ricciardone as saying.  The U.S. is seeking international cooperation to stop the
flow of arms to  Syria  from Iran, the Istanbul-based newspaper
quoted Ricciardone as saying in a meeting with journalists in
Ankara.  The U.S. is also dissatisfied with efforts from the Kurdish
administration in Iraq under  Massoud Barzani  to stop the flow of
arms and PKK fighters across its borders, Zaman quoted him as
saying.  To contact the reporter on this story:
