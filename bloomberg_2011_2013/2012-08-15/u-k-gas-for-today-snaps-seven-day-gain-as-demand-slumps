U.K. natural gas for delivery today
declined for the first time in eight days as forecast demand
fell to the lowest in 11 months.  Within-day gas dropped as much as 2.3 percent, according to
broker data compiled by Bloomberg. Demand in the 24 hours to 6
a.m. tomorrow will be 155 million cubic meters, the least since
September 2011,  National Grid Plc (NG/)  data show.  Same-day gas  fell 1.1 pence, or 2 percent, to 54.7 pence a
therm at 8:21 a.m. London time. September gas fell 0.8 percent
to 55.8 pence a therm. Thatâ€™s equivalent to $8.74 per million
British thermal units, and compares with $2.81 per million Btu
of front-month U.S. gas.  Gassco AS changed its planned maintenance schedule at the
Kollsnes natural gas-export plant in  Norway , according to a
statement on its  website .  Kollsnes will reduce exports by 25 million cubic meters a
day from Aug. 15 to Aug. 26 and by 45 million cubic meters a day
from Aug. 26 to Sept. 10. The company previously said flows
would be cut by 45 million cubic meters a day from Aug. 10 to
Sept. 10.  Norway is the biggest overseas gas supplier to the U.K..  To contact the reporter on this story:
