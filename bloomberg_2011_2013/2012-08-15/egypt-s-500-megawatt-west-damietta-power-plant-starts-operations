Egypt ’s 500-megawatt natural gas-fed
West Damietta power plant started operating at full capacity,
Energy and Electricity Minister Mahmoud Balbaa said.  The North African country has been hit by almost daily
blackouts, which the government attributes to increased demand
because of the summer heat. The grid was able to meet more of
the demand yesterday and that is expected to improve further in
the coming days, Balbaa said today in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
