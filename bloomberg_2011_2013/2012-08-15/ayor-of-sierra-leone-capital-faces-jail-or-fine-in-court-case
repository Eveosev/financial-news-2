The mayor of  Sierra Leone â€™s capital
city, Freetown, was sentenced to three years in jail or a 170
million-leone ($39,000) fine after he was found guilty of
breaching procurement laws, High Court Justice John Bosco
Katutsi said today.  Herbert George-Williams is being penalized for signing a
contract with a Jamaican musical group for a concert in December
2010, which the court ruled on Aug. 10 violated policies in the
West African nation.  Bernard Jones, a lawyer who appeared in court today for
George-Williams declined to comment on whether his client would
appeal the sentence when reached on his mobile phone. Another
lawyer, Yada Williams, said after the verdict last week the
mayor, who had been suspended from office and was remanded into
prison custody, was considering an appeal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
