BP Plc (BP/) ’s Sangachal terminal south of
 Azerbaijan ’s capital, Baku, exported less oil exports in the
first half of the year.  The terminal shipped 147 million barrels of oil in January
through June, down 4.9 percent , from a year earlier, the
London-based energy producer said by e-mail today.  Of the total, 130 million barrels were delivered to world
markets via the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline, or BTC, and 13
million barrels through the Western Route Export Pipeline, also
known as the Baku-Supsa link. Both pipelines are operated by BP.
The remaining 3 million barrels were exported by rail, BP said.  The Sangachal terminal has a capacity of 1.2 million metric
tons of oil and 25.5 million cubic meters of natural gas a day,
according to BP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
