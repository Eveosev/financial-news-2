Russian billionaire Mikhail
Fridman’s Altimo said it’s seeking to buy shares in  VimpelCom
Ltd. (VIP) , the world’s sixth-biggest mobile phone provider, from
 Telenor ASA. (TEL)   “We are calling on Telenor to sell some of its shares to
even our stakes in the company,” Altimo’s Vice President Evgeny Dumalkin said by phone from Moscow today. “We believe that
Russian and foreign shareholder must have equal stakes in
VimpelCom. It’s our strategic vision and we call on Telenor to
share such approach.”  Altimo said in a statement today that it increased its
stake in VimpelCom to 40.5 percent of the  voting rights  by
purchasing 305 million shares from Egyptian Billionaire Naquib Sawiris’s Weather Investments II.  Russia’s Anti-Monopoly Service is disputing Telenor’s right
to increase its stake in VimpelCom after the Nordic company
bought an 11.3 percent stake from Weather Investments in
February.  Altimo may further increase its stake by purchasing shares
on the market, Dumalkin added. The company’s earlier talks with
Telenor failed as the Nordic region’s second-largest phone
company refused to sell any part of its stake in VimpelCom, he
said.  Dag Melgaard, an Oslo-based spokesman for Telenor, did not
immediately reply to an e-mailed request for comment.  VimpleCom shares rallied 8.7 percent to $10.20 in New York,
the highest level in three months.  To contact the reporter on this story:
