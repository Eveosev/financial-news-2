Western Canada Select, a heavy oil
blend from  Alberta , weakened after a hydrotreater fire at BP
Plc’s Whiting,  Indiana , refinery threatened to curb crude
demand.  Planned repairs on the unit were suspended, a person with
knowledge of the situation said. The person, who asked not to be
identified because the information is private, didn’t know if
the suspension of the work and an investigation into the fire
would delay the completion of the maintenance.  Western Canada Select’s  discount  widened 75 cents to $14.75
a barrel below West Texas Intermediate at 2:07 p.m. in  New York ,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Syncrude, a synthetic oil upgraded from tarlike bitumen in
Alberta into refinery-ready crude, strengthened 85 cents to a
$7.10 premium above the U.S. benchmark.  The discount for Bakken oil from  North Dakota  was unchanged
at 50 cents below WTI.  Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium to the U.S. benchmark added
70 cents to $19.70 a barrel. Heavy Louisiana Sweet increased 65
cents to $19.40 per barrel over WTI.  Poseidon’s  premium  added 15 cents to $14.55 a barrel. Mars
Blend increased 10 cents to $14.65 a barrel over WTI. Southern
Green Canyon’s premium added 25 cents to $14.25.  Thunder Horse , a sour crude with lower sulfur content than
Mars, Poseidon and Southern Green Canyon, increased 20 cents to
a premium of $17.  To contact the reporter on this story:
