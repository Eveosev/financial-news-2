China International Marine
Containers Group Co. (200039) , the world’s biggest container maker,
gained the most in four months after announcing plans to move
trading of its shares to  Hong Kong  from China’s Shenzhen stock
exchange.  The stock  rose  3.3 percent, the biggest advance since April
18, to close at HK$9.67. The benchmark Shenzhen B Share Index
gained 1.4 percent.  China International Marine intends to list on the Hong Kong
Stock Exchange by converting 1.43 billion B shares to H shares,
it said in a statement today. The move means the shares will be
subject to rules of the Hong Kong exchange, and be listed in a
market where average daily trading volumes in the past 30 days
were 2000 times larger than that for B shares, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  “There’s never been a case of B shares being converted to
H shares, so this is innovative,” Xu Minle, a Shanghai-based
analyst at Bank of  China  Ltd., said by telephone. “B shares are
lightly traded and less active compared with H shares, so this
is good for their name recognition globally.”  The proposal is subject to regulatory approvals.
Shareholders may also opt to receive cash by requesting a third
party purchase the B shares, China International said.  The move “is in the best interests of the group” and
doesn’t undermine its goal to strengthen its position as the
leading port investor and operator in China, Fu Yuning, chairman
of shareholder China Merchants Holdings (International) Co.,
said in a statement to the Hong Kong stock exchange.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
