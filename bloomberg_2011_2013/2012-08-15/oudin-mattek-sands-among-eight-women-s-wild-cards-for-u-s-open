Melanie Oudin  received a wild-card
entry for the  U.S. Open , where she reached the quarterfinals
three years ago.  Oudin, ranked 106th by the WTA, was among eight female
wild-card recipients announced by the U.S. Tennis Association in
a news release. Others were Bethanie Mattek-Sands, Nicole Gibbs,
Mallory Burdette, Victoria Duval and Julia Cohen, all from the
U.S.; Casey Dellacqua of Australia; and Kristina Mladenovic of
France.  Wild cards are given to eight players in the men’s and
women’s fields who wouldn’t automatically qualify for the main
draw. The Open, the year’s final major, starts Aug. 27 at the
National Tennis Center in New York.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
