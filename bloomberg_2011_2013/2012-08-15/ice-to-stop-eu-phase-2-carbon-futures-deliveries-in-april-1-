The premium for June European Union
carbon permits over those for March widened to a record after
the ICE Futures Europe exchange said it would not accept Phase 2
allowances for delivery into futures contracts after April.  “Phase 2 EUAs will not be acceptable for delivery into the
May 2013 and subsequent futures contracts,” the London-based
exchange said in a  statement  posted on its website today.  Phase 2 permits, known as EUAs, may be used by factories
and power stations for compliance with their 2012 targets until
the final deadline of April 30. Phase 3 of the bloc’s cap-and-
trade system begins in January and runs through 2020.  The premium for June 2013 permits over those for March
widened as much as 21 percent to a record 29 euro cents ($0.36)
a metric ton on ICE and closed at a 27 cents. The December 2012
contract, the benchmark, dropped 2.2 percent today to 7.49 euros
a ton, more than reversing yesterday’s 2.1 percent advance.  The first Phase 3 futures contract will be for delivery in
May 2013,  Claire Miller , a spokeswoman for ICE Futures, said in
an e-mailed response to questions.  Futures contracts for aviation allowances for airlines
covered by the EU’s market in 2012 will also run to April, ICE
Futures said. The first Phase 3 contract for EU aviation permits
will be for delivery in December 2013, the bourse said.  The EU will exchange emitters’ surplus Phase 2 permits for
Phase 3 allowances no later than the end of June,  according to  a
European Commission document published on its website. It’s
unclear when the conversion of Phase 2 allowances will begin.  United Nations Certified Emission Reduction credits for
December dropped 5.6 percent today to close at 2.85 euros.  To contact the reporters on this story:
