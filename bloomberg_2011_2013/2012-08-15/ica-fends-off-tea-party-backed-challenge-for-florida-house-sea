U.S. Representative  John Mica 
defeated Tea Party-backed Representative Sandy Adams last night
in a Republican primary to determine their partyâ€™s nomination in
a redrawn Florida district.  Mica, chairman of the House Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, had 61 percent of the vote compared
with 39 percent for Adams with 100 percent of precincts
reporting, according to the  Associated Press . Adams, 55, in her
first term in Congress, had support from Tea Party figures
including former Alaska governor Sarah Palin.  Mica, 69, in his 10th term in Congress, will face Jason Kendall, a self-described fiscally conservative Democrat, in the
November general election. Kendall defeated Nicholas Ruiz in the
Democratic primary last night, 61 percent to 39 percent with 100
percent of precincts reporting, according to the AP.  To contact the reporter on this story:
