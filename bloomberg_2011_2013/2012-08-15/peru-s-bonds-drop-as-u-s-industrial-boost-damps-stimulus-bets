Peruvian dollar bonds fell, pushing
yields to the highest in five weeks, as signs of improvement in
the  U.S. economy  curbed speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
expand monetary stimulus.  The yield on the nation’s benchmark 6.55 percent dollar-
denominated bond due March 2037 climbed four basis points, or
0.04 percentage point, to 3.87 percent at 2:14 p.m. in Lima,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The price fell 0.82
cent to 142.25 cents per dollar.  U.S. Treasuries fell as industrial production increased in
July more than forecast and after a report yesterday showed
retail sales rose for the first time in four months. The Fed
will hold off from a third round of bond buying known as
quantitative easing in September as economic reports show signs
of improvement, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a report.  There’s “less probability of QE3, in the short term at
least,” Bret Rosen, a Latin America strategist at Standard
Chartered Bank, said in a phone interview from  New York .  The sol gained 0.1 percent to 2.6145 per  U.S. dollar 
according to Deutsche Bank AG’s local unit.  Peru’s central bank said on its website it bought $110
million in the spot market today and paid an average 2.6150
soles per dollar.  To contact the reporter on this story:
