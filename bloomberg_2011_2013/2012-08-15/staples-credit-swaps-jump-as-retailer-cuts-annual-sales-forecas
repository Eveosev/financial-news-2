The cost to guard against losses on
 Staples Inc. (SPLS) ’s debt surged to the highest in more than three
years after the world’s largest office-supply retailer cut its
annual sales forecast as weak U.S. growth depressed revenue.  Credit-default swaps tied to Framingham, Massachusetts-
based Staples jumped 38.5 basis points to 348 basis points as of
8:44 a.m. in New York, according to data provider CMA, which is
owned by McGraw-Hill Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers
in the privately negotiated market. That’s the highest since the
contracts closed at 381.8 basis points on Jan. 12, 2009.  Staples said today sales will be unchanged this year,
compared with projections in May of low single-digit growth,
according to a statement distributed by  Business Wire . Net
income plunged 32 percent in the 13 weeks ended July 28 to
$120.4 million.  Sales dropped to $5.5 billion in the period, missing the
$5.72 billion in revenue called for by analysts. Full-year
earnings per share at Staples will increase in the low single-
digits from $1.37 a share last year, down from projections of
high single-digit growth three months ago, according to the
statement.  The price of Staples credit-default swaps, which typically
rise as investor confidence deteriorates and fall as it
improves, means investors would have to pay $348,000 annually to
protect $10 million of the company’s debt for five years.  The contracts pay the buyer face value if a borrower fails
to meet its obligations, less the value of the defaulted debt. A
basis point equals $1,000 annually on a contract protecting $10
million of debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
