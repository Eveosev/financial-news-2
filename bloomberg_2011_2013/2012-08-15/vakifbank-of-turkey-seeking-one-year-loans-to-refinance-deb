Turkiye Vakiflar Bankasi TAO (VAKBN) , a
state-run bank, is seeking a one-year loan to refinance debt
maturing next month at lower costs.  The Turkish lender is proposing to pay 135 basis points
above a benchmark lending rate --85 basis points in interest
margin and 50 basis points in fees -for the loan, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg. The bank refinanced a one-year
syndicated loan split into $145 million and 433 million euros
($531.4 million) at one percentage point over international
benchmarks in September.  Vakifbank paid 145 basis points above international
benchmarks for a $152 million and 586.7 million-euro one-year
syndicated loan in April, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Moody’s Investors Service raised the foreign-currency debt
grade of Vakifbank, along with four other Turkish banks, by two
levels to an investment-grade rating of Baa2 on July 4. The
upgrade of  Turkey ’s sovereign rating to one step below
investment grade on June 20 had “credit positive effects on
ratings of various banks,” Moody’s analysts Arif Bekiroglu and
Carola Schuler said in a statement at the time.  Vakifbank rose 1.3 percent to 3.96 liras at 5:16 p.m. in
Istanbul, the highest on a closing basis since May 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
