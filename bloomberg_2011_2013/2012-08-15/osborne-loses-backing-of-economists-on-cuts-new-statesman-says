U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer
 George Osborne  has lost the support of a group of economists who
wrote an open letter before the last general election supporting
his fiscal squeeze, the  New Statesman  reported.  Only one of the 20 economists who put their names to the
letter in February 2010 “was willing to repeat his
endorsement,” the London-based magazine said in a statement
today. Nine called on Osborne to abandon his opposition to
fiscal stimulus and promote growth through tax cuts and higher
infrastructure spending, while others declined to comment or
were not at work.  Osborne has resisted demands to ease his deficit-reduction
program, saying the cuts have helped push down  borrowing costs 
and insulated Britain from the euro-area debt crisis. At the
time the letter was published, three months before Prime
Minister  David Cameron ’s coalition took office as the then
Labour government was pledging more spending to aid the economy,
Osborne said the endorsement of his plans was a “stunning
development.”  Among the economists who signed the 2010 letter, which
appeared in the Sunday Times newspaper, Capital Economics Ltd.
Managing Director  Roger Bootle  said he would “alter the plan”
and stop cuts to public investment, according to the New
Statesman.  David Newbury, emeritus professor of economics at  Cambridge
University , said while it was necessary to cut current spending,
“given the poor state of Britain’s publicly funded
infrastructure and the looming recession, the necessary
counterpart is to increase public investment expenditure even if
this worsens the short-run public deficit.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
