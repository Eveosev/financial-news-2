Hog futures declined to the lowest
since March on signs of slowing demand and the outlook for
increasing supplies of U.S. pork. Cattle were little changed.  U.S. pork output will total 23.4 billion pounds (10.6
metric tons) this year and increase another 3.1 percent to
24.135 billion next year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture 
said in a  report  yesterday. Wholesale  pork  declined 1.6 percent
to $1.0075 yesterday, the lowest since June 11, government data
show. Prices are down 9.5 percent from $1.1133 a pound on June
26, the highest since at least October 1997, USDA data show.  “Because the product is slowing down, the cash market is
too,” Jason Golly, a vice president of risk-management
marketing at Lynch Livestock Inc., said in a telephone
interview.  Hog futures for October settlement dropped 0.4 percent to
83.9 cents a pound at 11:08 a.m. on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange after touching 83.5 cents a pound, the lowest for the
most-active contract since March 11. Futures for August
settlement declined 0.7 percent to 94.625 cents.  Cattle futures for October delivery slumped 0.2 percent to
$1.26225 a pound on the CME. Feeder-cattle futures for August
settlement rose 0.1 percent to $1.50275 a pound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
