The installation rate of offshore wind turbines in Europe doubled in the first half of the year, with  Siemens AG (SIE)  machines taking the bulk of the market.  A total of 1,045 megawatts of capacity of wind turbines were connected at sea, compared with 523.2 megawatts in the year-earlier period, the European Wind Energy Association said today in an e-mailed  report .  Siemens (SIE)  took 83 percent of that, followed by Bard Holding GmbH with 10 percent and  Suzlon Energy Ltd. (SUEL) ’s Repower unit on 7 percent.  Countries including the U.K. and Germany are relying on offshore wind to help them meet their carbon reduction and renewable energy goals. At the same time, installations risk tailing off without clearer rules and targets beyond 2020, according to the Brussels-based EWEA, which said just one new project has reached financial close in the past six months.  The sole financing, “together with a lack of orders being placed for offshore wind turbines, substructures and components, reflects the regulatory uncertainty in key offshore markets including  Germany  and the U.K.,” EWEA Director of Policy Justin Wilkes said in the statement. “To attract investment to the sector governments need to provide a stable regulatory framework and the EU should set a binding renewable target for 2030.”  About half of this year’s installed capacity has been in the U.K., with 513.5 megawatts, according to EWEA. Denmark connected 352.8 megawatts to the grid, Germany installed 105 megawatts, and  Belgium  had 73.8 megawatts.  Total offshore capacity now amounts to 6,040 megawatts across 58 wind farms in 10 European countries, according to the industry assocation. A further 21 wind farms at sea are under construction or in preparation, totaling 5,694 megawatts, it said.
