(Corrects conversion in second paragraph.)  Cape Town  in  South Africa  is
considering building the continent’s largest desalination plant,
Beeld reported, citing mayoral committee member Ernest
Sonnenberg.  A feasibility study for the seawater desalination plant
will be completed by December, the Johannesburg based newspaper
said. The plant will have a capacity of 150 million liters (40
million U.S. gallons) to 450 million liters per day.  The eThekwini municipality, which includes the east coast
city of Durban, is seeking to construct a 150 million liter per
day plant which may cost between 2.7 billion rand ($270 million)
and 2.9 billion rand, Beeld said, citing Umgeni Water official
Shami Haricunder.  Africa’s biggest existing desalination plant, with a
capacity of 45 million liters per day, is located near the
Namibian coastal town Swakopmund, according to Beeld.  To contact the reporter on this story:
