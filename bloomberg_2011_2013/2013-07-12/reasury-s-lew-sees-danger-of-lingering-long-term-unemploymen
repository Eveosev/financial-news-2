U.S. Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew
said long-term unemployment could pose a threat to world’s
largest economy as it recovers from the deepest recession since
the Great Depression.  “The danger is there could be a lingering long-term
unemployment problem,” Lew said on  CNN ’s Fareed Zakaria
program, according to a transcript the network released today.
“Particularly for young people who came out of school during
the recession or for older workers who lost their jobs during
the recession and haven’t been able to get back in.”  Lew also said that the debate on a possible U.S. default
must not happen again.  To contact the reporter on this story:
