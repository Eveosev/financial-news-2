Domtar Corp. (UFS) , a Canadian pulp and
paper manufacturer, fell after reporting an unexpected second-quarter operating loss as maintenance costs increased and pulp
productivity fell.  Domtar, based in  Montreal , dropped 2.2 percent to C$74.59
at the close in Toronto today. The shares have declined 10
percent this year.  The company said it expects to report an operating loss in
the second quarter of $30 million to $35 million on sales of
$1.31 billion. Analysts projected an operating profit of $64
million and revenue of $1.36 billion, according to average
 estimates  compiled by Bloomberg.  “We had sub-optimal pulp productivity and unusually high
costs due to significant planned maintenance and delayed
restarts in our pulp mills,” Chief Executive Officer  John Williams  said in a statement. “We remain confident that we will
return to more normalized productivity levels across the
business by the end of the third quarter.”  The company said its operating loss in the quarter included
$18 million in closing and restructuring costs and a $49 million
charge to settle litigation.  Domtar is scheduled to release its second-quarter  earnings
results  on July 25 before the markets open in Toronto.  To contact the reporter on this story:
