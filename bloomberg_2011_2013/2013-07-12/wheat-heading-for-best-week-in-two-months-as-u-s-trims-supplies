Corn futures fell in Chicago on
signs that global supplies will be ample amid a rebound in U.S.
production and declining demand for the grain. Wheat headed for
the biggest weekly gain in two months.  Stockpiles in the U.S., the world’s biggest producer, may
be 1.959 billion bushels by the end of the 2013-14 marketing
year, the  U.S. Department of Agriculture  said yesterday. That’s
up from last month’s estimate of 1.949 billion bushels, as the
agency cut its outlook for demand from livestock farmers and
importers. Analysts in a Bloomberg survey expected the USDA to
cut its inventory forecast. The country may harvest a record
13.95 billion bushels of corn, the USDA said.  “We continue to expect a significant recovery in U.S. corn
and soybean production and lower prices” in the second half,
Damien Courvalin, a New York-based analyst at Goldman Sachs
Group Inc., said in an e-mailed report. “Our expectation for
lower prices also reflects the already realized large South
American harvest and current weakness in global demand.”  Corn for December delivery fell 0.3 percent to $5.255 a
bushel by 6:37 a.m. on the  Chicago  Board of Trade. The grain
still headed for a 7 percent weekly advance on concern warm
weather in the U.S. would damage crops. Last year, corn rallied
to a record $8.49 a bushel as production was hurt by drought.  Soybeans for delivery in November dropped 0.3 percent to
$12.87 a bushel, while heading for the first weekly increase
since May. U.S. inventories may be 295 million bushels by the
end of the year on Aug. 31, 2014, more than previously estimated
and bigger than analysts expected, the USDA said.  Milling Wheat  Wheat for September delivery rose 0.2 percent to $6.85 a
bushel in Chicago. Futures are heading for a 3.8 percent
increase this week, the biggest for a most-active contract since
the five days to May 3. In Paris, milling wheat for November
delivery fell 0.4 percent to 198.50 euros ($258.72) a metric ton
on NYSE Liffe.  The USDA cut its forecast for global wheat inventories to
172.38 million tons, 4.9 percent smaller than estimated a month
ago, amid rising demand in  China . U.S. export sales jumped to
1.47 million tons in the week to July 4, more than double a week
earlier, with China buying 1.02 million tons, according to a
separate USDA  report .  To contact the reporters on this story:
