Los Angeles Lakers  forward Metta World Peace was designated as the team’s amnesty player under
the National Basketball Association’s labor agreement, General
Manager Mitch Kupchak said.  World Peace, 33, who used to be known as  Ron Artest ,
averaged 12.4 points and 5.0 rebounds in 75 games last season.
Before joining the Lakers in 2009, he played with the  Houston
Rockets , Sacramento Kings,  Indiana Pacers  and Chicago Bulls,
averaging 14.1 points and 4.7 rebounds during his 14-year
career.  “It’s tough to say goodbye to a player such as Metta, who
has been a significant part of our team the past four seasons,”
Kupchak said yesterday in a statement on the team’s website.
“For anyone who’s had the opportunity to get to know him, it’s
impossible not to love him.”  Under the amnesty clause, the Lakers will continue to pay
his salary throughout his contract although it will not count
against the salary cap or luxury tax. If World Peace signs with
another team, his new salary will be deducted from what the
Lakers owe.  World Peace will go through a waiver process under which
teams can bid on his contract.  World Peace, a native of Queens, New York, who played at
 St. John’s University  in 1997-99, was the NBA Defensive Player
of the Year in 2004, when he also was selected as an All-Star.  To contact the reporter on this story:
