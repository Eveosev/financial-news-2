 Zambia’s plan to name a national
soccer stadium, set to be finished by the end of the year, the
Gabon Disaster Heroes National Stadium has ignited national
controversy.  The stadium, built by  China ’s Shanghai Construction Co.,
will be named to honor the 18 national team players who perished
off the Gabonese coast in 1993, Sports Minister Chishimba
Kwambili said this week. China’s government helped finance the
construction of the 50,000-seat venue.  “At least if it was just Heroes stadium,” James Banda, a
40-year-old carpenter selling hand-carved doors, said in an
interview yesterday. “Gabon is another country, this is
Zambia.”  The players who died are buried less than 100 meters (328
feet) to the west of the site of the stadium off Cairo Road in
the north of Lusaka, Zambia’s capital. The team and five
officials were on their way to  Senegal  for a  World Cup  qualifier
match when the plane crashed.  “If I was asked to give my opinion, I would go with Heroes
Stadium,” Kalusha Bwalya, Football Association of Zambia
president and the country’s most capped player said in a
statement posted to the organizations website yesterday.  The stadium’s name sparked a debate online, where people
criticized it for being too long, including some who posted
jokes on Twitter under the hashtag
#ThingsShorterThanTheNameGivenToTheNewlyBuiltStadiuminLusaka.  To contact the reporter on this story:
