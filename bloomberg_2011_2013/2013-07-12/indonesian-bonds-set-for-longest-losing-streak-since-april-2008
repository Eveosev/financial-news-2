Indonesian bonds declined for a
ninth week, the longest losing streak in five years, after the
central bank boosted its benchmark rate by the most since 2005
to slow inflation. The rupiah fell to the lowest since 2009.  Bank Indonesia  raised its  reference rate  by 50 basis points
to 6.50 percent yesterday, the most since December 2005. The
decision was predicted by only three out of 19 economists
surveyed by Bloomberg. Fourteen forecast a 25 basis point
increase while two expected no change. The monetary authority
sees the pace of price gains approaching the upper end of its
7.2 percent to 7.8 percent target range for 2013, Governor Agus Martowardojo said in Jakarta yesterday.  The yield on the government’s 5.625 percent notes due May
2023 surged 67 basis points this week to 8.07 percent as of 3:39
p.m. in Jakarta, the highest level since March 2011 and the
biggest jump since September 2011, prices from the Inter Dealer
Market Association show. It rose 17 basis points today,
completing a ninth consecutive weekly climb, the longest run of
increases since April 2008. Global funds pulled 18.2 trillion
rupiah ($1.8 billion) from local sovereign  debt holdings  since
May 22, when the  Federal Reserve  signaled plans to reduce its
monthly debt purchases.  “Inflation should peak in July, limiting room for much
higher yields as Bank  Indonesia ’s tightening cycle should be
near its end,” said Handy Yunianto, head of fixed-income
research in Jakarta at PT Mandiri Sekuritas, a unit of nation’s
largest bank by assets. “In addition to inflation, the Fed
tapering outlook is causing portfolio rebalancing in  emerging
markets .”  Consumer prices in Indonesia gained 5.9 percent last month,
from 5.47 percent in May, official data show.  Rupiah Weakens  The rupiah dropped 0.5 percent this week to 9,993 per
dollar, after reaching 9,995 earlier, the lowest level since
September 2009, prices from local banks compiled by Bloomberg
show. The currency will gain to about 9,800 by year-end, said
Yunianto. One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 1.5 percent to
10,163, trading at a 1.7 percent discount to the spot rate.  One-month implied volatility, a measure of expected moves
in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell 1.53 percentage
points to 10.80 percent, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg.  Indonesia sold $1 billion of 10-year dollar-denominated
notes at 5.45 percent, Robert Pakpahan, director general at the
debt management office, said yesterday. That’s the highest yield
offered for that maturity since the 6 percent paid at a January
2010 issue.  To contact the reporter on this story:
