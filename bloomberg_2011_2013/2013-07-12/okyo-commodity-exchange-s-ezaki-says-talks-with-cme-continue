remains in talks with CME Group Inc. about the possibility of
sharing trading systems, President Tadashi Ezaki said.  Ezaki, who met CME Chief Executive Officer Phupinder Gill
yesterday over lunch in Tokyo, told reporters today he would
like to make a decision as soon as possible, without providing
any specific time frame.  Tocom, as the bourse is commonly referred to, is also
talking to other potential partners including  Japan Exchange

Exchange was created through the integration of Osaka Securities

Japanese raw-material bourse was talking with U.S. competitors
to integrate trading systems and attract more participants from
