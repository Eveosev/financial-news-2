JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) ’s corporate and
investment bank allocated almost the same amount of money for
employees in the first half from a year earlier as the
division’s revenue climbed 9 percent.  The unit’s $6.36 billion in first-half compensation costs
amounted to 33 percent of revenue, excluding accounting
adjustments, down from 34 percent in the prior year, according
to figures posted today on the New York-based firm’s website.
The amount is equal to $122,926 for each of the division’s
51,771 employees in the six months. The unit had 52,336
employees a year ago.  JPMorgan, the biggest  U.S. bank  by assets, combined its
investment bank with the corporate bank and treasury and
securities-services units last year under co-heads Mike Cavanagh, 47, and Daniel Pinto, 50. The group has more than
twice as many employees as the investment bank.  The amount set aside for compensation includes salaries,
bonuses, benefits and the cost of deferred pay from previous
years. Figures for average pay don’t represent what individuals
actually receive and are calculated by dividing the total
compensation expense by the number of employees.  To contact the reporters on this story:
