The U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission should consider new guidance to ensure investment
advisers fulfill their fiduciary duty when they follow the
recommendations of proxy advisory firms in shareholder
elections.  The SEC staff may have increased reliance on proxy advisers
by previously telling investment companies they could avoid
conflicts of interest by following the recommendations of an
independent third party, SEC Commissioner Daniel M. Gallagher
said today in a speech in  Seattle , according to his prepared
remarks. As a result, many investment advisers blindly follow
the recommendations of advisory firms such as Institutional
Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co., Gallagher said.  Commissioners should write their own guidance to replace
the staff’s earlier letters, Gallagher said at the national
conference of the Society of Corporate Secretaries and
Governance Professionals.  “Commission guidance clarifying to institutional investors
that they need to take responsibility for their voting decisions
rather than engaging in rote reliance on proxy advisory firm
recommendations would go a long way toward mitigating the
concerns arising from the outsized and conflicted role of proxy
advisory firms,” Gallagher said.  Gallagher, 41, has previously criticized what he describes
as over-reliance on advisory firms and said the SEC should
review how it regulates them. The SEC last sought public comment
on changing rules that apply to corporate elections and the role
of players in proxy voting in July 2010.  To contact the reporter on this story:
