Thailand ’s baht was set for its
biggest weekly gain in almost three months after Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  damped speculation a reduction in
stimulus that has boosted the supply of dollars was imminent.  Government bonds  due 2023 were poised for a third weekly
advance after Bernanke said July 10 that “highly
accommodative” monetary policy will be needed for the
“foreseeable future.” Overseas investors bought $136 million
more local shares than they sold in the last two days, exchange
data show. The Bank of Thailand held its benchmark  interest rate 
at 2.5 percent on July 10 and said the current level is
appropriate for the nation’s economic growth.  The baht climbed 0.6 percent this week, the most since the
period ended April 19, to 31.11 per dollar as of 8:40 a.m. in
Bangkok, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The currency,
which was steady today, reached 31.01 yesterday, the strongest
level since July 3. It has weakened 4.2 percent since May 22,
when Bernanke said the Fed could pare its bond buying.  “Bernanke’s comments were a big support for risk sentiment
this week,” said Pareena Phuangsiri, a Bangkok-based analyst at
Kasikornbank Pcl. “The Bank of Thailand didn’t signal a further
cut, which also helps. But the basic trend remains for dollar
strength on concern about the Fed’s tapering.”  One-month implied volatility in the baht, a measure of
expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price options, fell
39 basis points this week to 6.87 percent. It declined three
basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, today.  Growth Slowing  Gross domestic product may increase less than 5 percent
this year, compared with 6.5 percent in 2012, while growth in
exports will be lower than previously expected, the Bank of
Thailand said on July 10 after the rate decision. Official
forecasts will be released on July 19. Overseas sales, which
account for about two-third of  Southeast Asia ’s second-largest
economy, fell 5.1 percent in May from a year earlier, the most
since August, government figures show.  The yield on the 3.625 percent bonds due June 2023 dropped
two basis points from July 5 to 3.71 percent, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. The rate rose one basis point today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
