Indian (SENSEX)  stock-index futures gained,
signaling benchmark indexes may extend their biggest rallies in
two weeks.  SGX CNX Nifty Index futures  for July delivery rose 0.5
percent to 5,970.5 at 10:29 a.m. in Singapore. The underlying
CNX  Nifty (NIFTY)  Index surged 2 percent yesterday to 5,935.10, its
highest level since June 3. The S&P BSE Sensex advanced 2
percent to 19,676.06. The Bank of  New York  Mellon India ADR
Index of U.S.-traded shares jumped 3.8 percent to 1,004.09.  The Nifty and the Sensex climbed yesterday by the most
since June 28 after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
said the  U.S. economy  will continue to need stimulus.  Infosys
Ltd. (INFO) , India’s second-largest software services provider, is due
to report earnings for the June quarter today, the first Sensex
member to do so.  “The mood for today’s trading will be set be the Infosys
result,”  Arun Kejriwal , director at Kejriwal Research &
Investment Services, said by phone from Mumbai today. “Some of
the concerns on liquidity have eased after the Fed’s comments.”  Consumer price inflation and factory output data are due
after markets close today. Industrial production probably grew
1.5 percent in May, the slowest pace in three months, a
Bloomberg survey of economists showed.  Indian companies’ sales growth is declining in an economy
that expanded last quarter at near its slowest pace since 2009.
Revenue for the 30 Sensex companies may have increased 3.8
percent from a year earlier in the three months ended June, the
least in 16 quarters, according to Deutsche Bank AG.  Infosys Sales  “Revenue growth in aggregate is showing signs of
deceleration continuously and that remains a cause of concern,”
Vetri Subramaniam, who oversees $2.3 billion in assets as chief
investment officer at Religare Invesco Asset Management Co. in
Mumbai, said in a phone interview yesterday.  Infosys may move. The company is expected to forecast sales
in dollar terms will rise as much as 7.5 percent in the year to
March, compared with its earlier projection for as much as 10
percent growth, according to the median of 10 analysts in a
Bloomberg survey.  Global investors  have bought a net $174 million of domestic
shares this month through July 10, after selling $1.8 billion in
June, which was the most since August 2011, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. International investors bought $12 million of
local shares on July 10, taking this year’s inflows to $13.5
billion.  The Sensex has gained 1.3 percent this year and  trades  at
13.2 times projected 12-month earnings, compared with the MSCI
 Emerging Markets  Index’s 9.9 times.  To contact the reporter on this story:
