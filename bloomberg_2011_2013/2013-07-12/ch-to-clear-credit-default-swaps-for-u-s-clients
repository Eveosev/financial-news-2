LCH.Clearnet Group Ltd. said it
obtained regulatory permission to clear credit default swaps for
U.S. members via its clearinghouse in  Europe , a day after
American and European Union authorities agreed to cut overlap.  The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission gave the
approval to Paris-based LCH.Clearnet SA, even as it considers
LCH’s application to register as a derivatives clearing
organization, or DCO. U.S. members can now clear proprietary CDS
index trades through the unit, LCH said.  The CFTC and the European Commission yesterday said they
broke a deadlock over whether the U.S. could impose its rules on
trades booked in Europe. Banks and other swaps traders said the
deal reduces the chance they will be forced to comply with
conflicting regulatory regimes.  The decision “enables us to offer clearing services across
the broadest range of OTC derivative asset classes and
geographies in the market,” Ian Axe, LCH.Clearnet Group’s chief
executive officer, said in a statement. “We look forward to
continuing to work with the CFTC and other regulators as we grow
our U.S. business.”  LCH, which is now majority-owned by  London Stock Exchange
Group Plc (LSE) , is targeting growth in  Asia  and the U.S. The company
in February last year appointed David Weisbrod, who spent 40
years at JPMorgan Chase & Co., to head its U.S. unit. LCH
operates CDSClear and is also the world’s largest interest-rate-swap clearinghouse.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
