Nearly 200 prisoners, including five
charged with terrorism offenses, were on the run after escaping
an overcrowded prison in  Indonesia ’s North Sumatra province
during a deadly riot.  The violence yesterday, in which five people died, was
triggered by a power blackout that cut water supplies in the
Tanjung Gusta prison in the provincial capital of Medan, Djoko
Suyanto, Minister for Security and Political Affairs, told
reporters in Jakarta today.  Five out of nine inmates accused of terrorism who escaped
are among 176 to have evaded capture, Suyanto said. The five may
have already left Medan, National Police Chief Timur Pradopo
said in Jakarta. All roads from the city are being monitored
round the clock, he said.  “The situation at the prison is back under control,”
Suyanto said at a briefing. “The chase for the escaped inmates
continues.”  Tanjung Gusta prison holds 2,600 inmates, more than double
its capacity of 1,054, Suyanto said. The government will review
other prisons to avoid a repeat of yesterday’s riot, he said,
adding the basic needs of inmates cannot be ignored.  Indonesia has stepped up raids against terrorism suspects
since bombings in 2009 at Jakarta’s JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton
hotels killed nine people, including the two attackers. In Aceh
province, police in 2010 raided what they said was a training
camp for Islamic militants planning to bomb foreign embassies
and hotels.  To contact the reporters on this story:
