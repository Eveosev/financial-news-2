The U.K. government hired  BlackRock
Inc. (BLK)  to assess the value of  Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc ’s
assets as the Treasury reviews a potential break-up of the
bailed out British lender.  BlackRock Solutions will work with Rothschild and Slaughter
& May LLP to help the government decide whether it should split
up Edinburgh-based RBS, the Treasury said in a statement today.  Chancellor of the Exchequer  George Osborne  said last month
he was “urgently” investigating the case for hiving off RBS’s
toxic assets into a bad bank because the lender is weighed down
by too many toxic assets.  The government still owns 81 percent of the lender almost
five years after giving it a 45.5 billion-pound ($68.8 billion)
bailout, the costliest in banking history. RBS shares still
trade below the level at which taxpayers would break even on
their investment.  In its “swift” review the Treasury will particularly
examine RBS’s Ulster Bank and U.K. commercial property assets,
Osborne said last month. The Chancellor said he will decide on
the break-up in the autumn.  To contact the reporter on this story:
