Robusta coffee climbed for a fifth
day in London, heading for the biggest weekly advance in 10
months, as excessive rain may delaying harvesting in  Indonesia .  Rainfall in Java has been “persistently above average over
the last several weeks,” MDA Weather Services in Gaithersburg,
Maryland, said in a report e-mailed yesterday. Indonesia is the
third-largest coffee producer, after Brazil and Vietnam,
according to the  U.S. Department of Agriculture .  “Six weeks ago rain was disrupting the new harvest in
other areas as well,” said  Andrea Thompson , head of research
and analysis at INTL FCStone Inc.’s CoffeeNetwork in Belfast,
 Northern Ireland . “Most of Vietnam and Indonesia are holding
back supplies seeing how much higher prices can go.”  Robusta for September delivery climbed 0.6 percent to
$1,894 a metric ton at 10 a.m. on NYSE Liffe in London. Prices
are up 4.7 percent this week, heading for the biggest weekly
jump since Sept. 28. Arabica for September delivery climbed 0.6
percent to $1.2415 a pound on ICE Futures U.S. in New York.  “Arabica doesn’t really have solid fundamentals behind
it,” Thompson said. “This is a technical move.” Arabica
prices have dropped 14 percent this year while robusta fell 1.5
percent.  Cocoa in  London  gained 0.3 percent and advanced 0.1 percent
in New York to $2,242 a ton. White, or refined, sugar fell 0.1
percent to $461.60 a ton and raw sugar gained 0.2 percent to
16.13 cents a pound in New York.  To contact the reporter on this story:
