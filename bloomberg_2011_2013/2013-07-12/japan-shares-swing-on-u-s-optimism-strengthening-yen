Japanese  shares  swung between gains
and losses after U.S. stocks climbed to a record high, boosting
sentiment, while the yen’s gains against the dollar weighed on
the outlook for exporters.  The  Topix index  added 0.2 percent to 1,197.05 as of 9:13
a.m. in Tokyo. The Nikkei 225 Stock Average fell 0.2 percent to
14,429.78, after earlier rising as much as 0.2 percent.  “With U.S. stocks reaching another record high, investor
sentiment has gotten better and they’re more willing to take on
risk,” said Toshiaki Iwasaki, an analyst at Mito Securities Co.
Ltd. “Still, the market may be getting ahead of itself and may
not hold its gains until the close.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
