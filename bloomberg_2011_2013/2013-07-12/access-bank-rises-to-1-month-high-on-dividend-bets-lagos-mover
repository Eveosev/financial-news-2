Access Bank Plc (ACCESS)  rose to the highest
level in a month on bets the Nigerian lender will be able to pay
a first-half dividend as profit increases, according to
Greenwich Trust Group Ltd.  The Lagos-based  stock  gained for a second day, adding 2
percent to 11.30 naira, the highest since June 12. About 64
million shares, or three times the three-month daily average
volume, traded.  “There is speculation the bank will announce an interim
 dividend  as compensation to shareholders as it announces new
management and enters new growth phase,” Celia Rukato, an
analyst at Lagos-based Greenwich Trust said by phone today. “We
have a buy on the stock, with a price target of 13.17 naira as
income is forecast to rise from expansion.”  Segun Fafore, a spokesman for Access Bank, could not
immediately comment when contacted by phone today.  Access Bank appointed Herbert Wigwe to succeed Aigboje Aig-Imoukhuede as chief executive officer at year-end last week and
announced it is shifting focus to target retail customers in
 Africa ’s most populous nation of more than 160 million people.  Profit in the three months through March declined 21
percent to 9.21 billion naira ($57 million), the lender said
April 8. Revenue dropped to 52.7 billion naira from 53.1 billion
naira a year earlier.  The stock has gained by 25 percent this year, compared with
the 24 percent increase in the 10-member Bloomberg Nigerian
Stock Exchange Banking Index and 33 percent rise in the  Nigerian
Stock Exchange All-Share Index. (NGSEINDX)   To contact the reporter on this story:
