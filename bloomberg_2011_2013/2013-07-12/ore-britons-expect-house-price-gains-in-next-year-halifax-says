Britons’ confidence in the housing
market has risen, with more consumers forecasting price gains
than declines in the next year, a survey by Halifax showed.  A gauge of the housing market measuring value expectations
climbed to 40 in June from 33 in March, the mortgage unit of
Lloyds Banking Group Plc said in an e-mailed statement in  London 
today. June’s reading was the highest since Halifax began the
quarterly survey in April 2011. Fifty-two percent of respondents
predict prices will advance over the next 12 months, with 12
percent forecasting decreases, it said.  “Sentiment regarding the outlook for  house prices  has
improved markedly over the past quarter, continuing the trend
seen since late 2012,” Halifax economist  Martin Ellis  said in
the statement. “Nonetheless, the market still faces substantial
headwinds with, for example, house prices remaining above the
historical average in relation to earnings. Such factors are
likely to prevent a sharp acceleration in house prices.”  The survey chimes with recent housing data that have shown
an improving market. Reports from Hometrack Ltd., Acadametrics
Ltd., and  Nationwide Building Society  all showed values rose in
June as the Bank of England’s Funding for Lending Scheme and the
government’s Help-to-Buy program eased the supply of credit.  Halifax questioned 1,959 adults between June 21 and June 27
for today’s report.  To contact the reporter on this story:
