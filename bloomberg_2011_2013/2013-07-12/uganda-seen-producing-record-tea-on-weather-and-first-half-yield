Uganda ,  Africa ’s third-biggest tea
grower, may produce its highest ever crop after raising its 2013
forecast on favorable weather and half-year yields.  The East African nation is expected to produce 60 million
kilograms (132 million pounds) this year, up from a January
forecast of 55 million, George William Ssekitoleko, executive
secretary of the Uganda Tea Association, said in a phone
interview today from the capital, Kampala. That would beat a
record yield of 59 million kilograms in 2010.  Uganda, which is Africa’s biggest robusta coffee grower,
exports about 97 percent of its tea via Mombasa, site of the
world’s largest tea auction in neighboring  Kenya . Uganda ranks
behind Kenya and Malawi as the continent’s biggest tea producers
and the crop is one of its major foreign income earners.  “Field reports indicate good yields so far, although we
haven’t compiled figures,” Ssekitoleko said. “We may achieve
60 million kilograms if the weather remains favorable,” he said
referring to good rainfall patterns.  The new forecast is 5.3 percent higher than last year’s 57
million kilograms, he said.  Yields are rising due to increased planting in the last few
years and the use of more fertilizers, Ssekitoleko said without
providing details.  The Ugandan unit of  McLeod Russell India Ltd. (MCLR) , the world’s
largest tea grower, accounts for about a quarter of the East
African nation’s annual output of the crop, according to the
association.  To contact the reporter on this story:
