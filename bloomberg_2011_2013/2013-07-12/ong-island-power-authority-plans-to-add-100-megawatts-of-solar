Long Island Power Authority, which
left thousands of customers without electricity for weeks after
 Hurricane Sandy  struck in October, plans to add 100 megawatts of
solar energy, enough for about 13,000 homes.  The solar projects will all be built on Long Island and
electricity produced in certain areas will qualify for a premium
of about 7 cents a kilowatt-hour, according to an e-mailed
statement today.  “LIPA continues to fulfill our commitment to be a leader
in the advancement of efficiency and renewable energy,” Chief
Operating Officer John D. McMahon said in the statement. The
authority provides electricity to more than 1.1 million
customers.  The authority also is developing this year a feed-in tariff
program to offer higher rates for 20 megawatts of electricity
produced from wind, fuel cells and other clean sources. In
another initiative, LIPA is preparing to solicit bids for as
much as 280 megawatts of renewable energy.  New York  Governor  Andrew Cuomo  last month reached an
agreement with state lawmakers to allow Public Service
 Enterprise Group Inc. (E) , the largest provider of gas and electric
service in New Jersey, to take over the operations of state-owned LIPA, established in 1985.  To contact the reporter on this story:
