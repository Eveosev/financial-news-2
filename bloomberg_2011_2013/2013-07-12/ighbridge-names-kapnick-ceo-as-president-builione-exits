Highbridge Capital Management LLC, a
unit of  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) , appointed former  Goldman Sachs (GS) 
Group Inc. executive Scott Kapnick chief executive officer of
the 21-year-old asset-management firm, replacing co-founder
 Glenn Dubin .  Dubin will remain chairman and continue to invest his
personal money in the firm’s funds, New York-based Highbridge
said in a statement today. Highbridge said it intended since its
start “to establish a business that would outlast its
founders.”  Highbridge is owned by JPMorgan Asset Management Inc., the
investment unit of the New York-based  lender , and manages about
$31 billion. Separately from today’s statement, KKR & Co., the
New York-based alternative-asset manager that oversees more than
$78 billion, said it hired Highbridge President Todd Builione to
help expand the firm’s hedge-fund business.  Kapnick joined Highbridge in 2007 to run its global credit
and private investment business, according to the firm. He
previously spent 21 years at Goldman Sachs, including as its
global co-head of  investment banking . The Principal Strategies
unit is Highbridge’s main investment arm and buys debt and
equity with longer-term holding periods, such as loans,
mezzanine and private-equity.  To contact the reporter on this story:
