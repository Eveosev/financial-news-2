David Shaw  and Fred Eychaner, two of
President  Barack Obama ’s top financial supporters, contributed
$500,000 apiece to Organizing for Action, according to figures
released today by the nonprofit group born out of the
president’s re-election campaign organization.  OFA said it raised $8.2 million from April to June,
bringing its total to $13.1 million since it officially formed
in January. The group isn’t required to disclose its donors,
though voluntarily does so.  The $500,000 gifts were the largest it received to date.  Eychaner, president of Chicago-based Newsweb Corp., raised
more than $500,000 for Obama’s campaign and donated $4.5 million
to Priorities USA Action, the super-political action committee
that backed the president’s 2012 re-election. Eychaner was the
largest contributor to the super-PAC, according to the Center
for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based research group.  Shaw, who started the New York-based hedge fund D.E. Shaw &
Co., brought in between $200,000 and $500,000 for the campaign
and gave $1.4 million to Priorities.  Philanthropist Amy Goldman, a $1 million donor to
Priorities USA Action, gave $250,000 to OFA.  Organizing for Action said it had 237,688 donors at the end
of June who gave an average of $55.16.  The group, formed to promote Obama’s policies in his second
term, is using the campaign’s e-mail list of 13 million people
and its social media accounts. Earlier this month, OFA started
running the second in a series of advertisements in support of
the president’s health-care law, which was passed in 2010 and
has been taking effect in stages. The measure expands coverage
to millions of Americans without insurance.  The organization is also running online ads backing the
bipartisan Senate immigration bill that would beef up border
security and provide a path to citizenship for undocumented
immigrants. The ads target House Speaker  John Boehner , an  Ohio
Republican  who has refused to bring the measure to the floor.  To contact the reporter on this story:
