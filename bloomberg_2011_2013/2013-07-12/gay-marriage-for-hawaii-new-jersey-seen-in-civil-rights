Gay-marriage advocates, emboldened by a landmark Supreme Court  ruling , are enlisting students in New Jersey, black pastors in Illinois and Filipinos in Hawaii to try to convince legislators that history is on their side.  The three states, which already allow civil unions, are the next battlegrounds in an all-out push by civil rights coalitions to legalize same-sex marriage and expand on last month’s victory in the nation’s highest court. The justices, taking up gay nuptials for the first time, struck down a U.S. law that denied federal benefits to same-sex married couples and cleared the way for weddings to resume in  California .  “We’re really preparing to be in a position to capitalize on all the momentum we have,” said Marc Solomon, national campaign director for New York-based  Freedom to Marry . “We want to win the next eight to 10 states as quickly as possible.”  By allowing states to continue to define marriage, the Supreme Court’s decision overturning a key part of the Defense of Marriage Act paved the way for gay-rights groups to seek change in state legislatures, courts and ballot boxes. The clash with organizations opposed to gay marriage is likely to spread to more than a dozen states before long.  Gay-rights advocates have already proved their fundraising prowess and ability to build broad coalitions, winning the right to marry in seven states in the last year alone.  Thirteen states  and the District of Columbia allow same-sex partners to wed, while 35 have anti-marriage laws or constitutional amendments on the books. Other states offer some protection for these couples.  Uneven Rules  While polls show a majority of Americans favor legalizing gay marriage, there are divisions among the states.  “Now we have a very uneven set of rules and laws around the country,” said  Brian Powell , a professor of sociology at  Indiana  University in Bloomington. “The Supreme Court’s decision was a compromise that gave states the permission to do what they want -- but that compromise in the end isn’t a very tenable one.”  On the federal level, a  Senate bill  that would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity was approved by the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee on July 10. It’s the first time in more than a decade that such a measure moved out of committee.  The Supreme Court decision put on the defensive same-sex marriage opponents who are also working to advance their position in the states.  Marriage Opponents  “By the nature of the situation we’ve been on defense because most every state has already defined marriage as between a man and a woman,” said Frank Schubert, national political director for the  Washington , D.C.-based  National Organization for Marriage . “We’re typically fighting proposals to change this.”  The group’s priority states include Oregon,  Ohio , Illinois and Indiana, he said. Schubert pointed to a June 26  statement  by Indiana Governor Mike Pence, a 54-year-old Republican, calling on the legislature to place a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage on the ballot in 2014. Oregon and Ohio are being targeted because they’re moving toward ballot initiatives on same-sex marriage.  Schubert’s organization will face off first against gay-rights advocates in states that allow civil unions or domestic partnerships, where same-sex marriage proponents are raising funds to hire lobbyists and campaign and communications consultants.  War Chest  Freedom to Marry  announced  on July 9 that it is investing $500,000 in state marriage campaigns, including $250,000 in an effort to place a measure overturning a ban on same-sex marriage on the ballot in  Oregon  in 2014. The organization is campaigning to raise $3 million this year.  In a 30-month  plan  posted on its website, the group said it’s “laying the groundwork to win six more states by 2015-2016,” from among  Arizona ,  Colorado ,  Michigan ,  Nevada , New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio,  Pennsylvania  and  Virginia .  The group’s “Win More States Fund” invested about $6 million in the past 18 months in successful campaigns in New Hampshire,  Delaware ,  Maine ,  Maryland ,  Minnesota , Rhode Island and Washington.  In states where legislators are unlikely to consider gay marriage, such as  Pennsylvania  and Michigan, same-sex marriage supporters are looking to the courts. They’re filing motions citing the Supreme Court’s June 26 decision striking down a portion of the Defense of Marriage Act.  ‘Clear Tool’  “It’s given us a very clear tool and a very effective one in all of our work, both in front of legislatures and in front of courts,” Camilla Taylor, senior staff attorney for New York-based Lambda Legal, said of the high court’s decision.  Courts in New Mexico,  New Jersey ,  Illinois , North Carolina and  Virginia  are also expected to consider lawsuits that test the constitutionality of state laws that don’t extend the same rights to gays as they do to heterosexual married couples.  In  Illinois , New Jersey and Hawaii, gay rights defenders are also working to advance measures in state legislatures legalizing same-sex marriage.  “Illinois has civil unions, but about 1,038 federal protections they could get with marriage don’t apply with civil unions,” said Lynne Bowman a regional field director with the Washington, D.C.-based  Human Rights Campaign . “The Supreme Court decision is changing the conversation and the energy for some of the folks who were, and still are, sitting on the fence.”  Enlisting Help  The Human Rights Campaign hired a pastor to organize in  Chicago ’s African-American faith community. It’s also enlisting a campaign director and formalizing a coalition of local civil rights and political groups and businesses to lobby lawmakers to consider a bill legalizing same-sex marriage when the legislature reconvenes late this year. Such a measure passed the state Senate in February but awaits a vote in the House.  A similar effort is under way in  Hawaii . The group is searching for a campaign manager to work with its 5,000 members and a coalition of 80 organizations, including Filipino-Americans, to push for a special session of the legislature to consider a bill legalizing gay marriage.  “We’re getting people to tell their stories about why it’s important to move quickly and decisively,” said Tony Wagner, a regional field director for the HRC. “We want to move the governor and the legislature to where they feel like it’s the right thing to do.”  The  Hawaii State Legislature  didn’t vote on several marriage-equality bills before it adjourned on May 7. Following the Supreme Court rulings, lawmakers said they were considering reconvening earlier than the next scheduled meeting date of January 2014.  Christie Veto  In New Jersey, gay rights groups are engaged in a campaign that involves unions, churches, businesses and university students. They’re seeking to connect with voters and urge municipalities to pass resolutions in support of marriage, said David Turley, a senior regional field organizer for the Human Rights Campaign.  Coalition volunteers are calling constituents in key districts this week encouraging them to ask their assemblyperson or senator to overturn a veto by Governor Chris Christie, 50, a Republican, of a bill passed by the Democratic-led legislature.  The gay-marriage bill passed 24-16 in the Senate and 42-33 in the Assembly. An override would require 27 votes in the Senate, where Democrats rule 24-16, and 54 in the Assembly, where they dominate 48-32.  “It’s a matter of reengaging and reactivating our strong coalition across the state,” Turley said. “There are glaring inequalities and loopholes in rights and benefits given to New Jersey couples.”  To contact the reporter on this story: Jennifer Oldham in Denver at  joldham1@bloomberg.net   To contact the editor responsible for this story: Cesca Antonelli at  fantonelli@bloomberg.net
