Taiwan’s dollar had the best week in
10 months after the central bank scaled back its intervention in
the  currency market .  Government bonds  rose.  Closing prices at 4 p.m. on the past four days were on
average less than 0.1 percent weaker than levels about three
minutes earlier, compared with 0.6 percent since the start of
June, Taipei Forex Inc. prices show. The central bank has cut
intervention, after having sold the local currency in the run-up
to the close on most days for more than a year, according to
traders who asked not to be identified. Asian currencies rose
this week after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  damped
speculation a reduction in stimulus was imminent.  “In the past few days, the central bank has been more
hands-off,” said Samson Tu, a Taipei-based  fund manager  at Uni-President Assets Management Corp., which oversees $700 million.
“Bernanke kind of rolled back on what he said earlier and that
helps rein in the strength of the greenback.”  The  Taiwan dollar  gained 1 percent this week and 0.1
percent today to NT$29.932 against its U.S. counterpart, Taipei
Forex prices show.  The island is bracing for a direct hit by Typhoon Soulik
today. While financial markets remain open, the government
announced schools and offices closed after 2 p.m.  One-month non-deliverable forwards rose 0.9 percent during
the five-day period and slipped 0.2 percent today to NT$29.890,
data compiled by Bloomberg show. One-month implied volatility, a
gauge of expected moves in the  exchange rate  used to price
options, fell 46 basis points from a week ago to 4.21 percent.  The yield on the 0.875 percent notes due January 2018 fell
11 basis points, or 0.11 percentage point, to 1.03 percent in
Taipei, according to Gretai Securities Market.  The  overnight interbank lending  rate was steady at 0.388
percent, according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan
Interbank Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
