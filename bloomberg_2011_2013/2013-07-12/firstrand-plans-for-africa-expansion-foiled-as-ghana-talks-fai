FirstRand Ltd. (FSR)  said talks to buy
Merchant Bank  Ghana  failed, setting back the efforts of  South
Africa ’s second-largest financial services company to build a
presence in West Africa.  “Despite all reasonable endeavors, the parties were unable
to reach agreement on the commercial principles underlying the
transaction,” Sam Moss, investor relations director of
Johannesburg-based FirstRand, said in an e-mailed statement
today. “The transaction cannot be completed and has lapsed.”  The failure of the negotiations with the Ghanaian bank come
after FirstRand ended talks to buy Nigeria’s Sterling Bank Plc
in 2011 as the parties were unable to agree on terms. FirstRand
offered to buy 75 percent of Merchant Bank Ghana for about 750
million rand ($74.7 million) last year after Chief Executive
Officer Sizwe Nxasana said in 2010 that the South African lender
intended to enter  Nigeria  and Ghana.  Ghana’s Social Security and National Insurance Trust will
invite new proposals from parties interested in buying Merchant
Bank, Moss said. “Ghana remains a priority country for
expansion and the group would continue to engage with SSNIT on
its new process,” she said.  FirstRand gained 0.9 percent to 28.80 rand at 11:27 a.m. in
Johannesburg.  FirstRand opened an investment banking unit in Nigeria’s
commercial capital, Lagos, in 2012.  To contact the reporter on this story:
