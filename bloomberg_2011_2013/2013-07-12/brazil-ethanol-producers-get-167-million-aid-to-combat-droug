Brazil  is preparing to disburse 380
million reais ($167 million) of subsidies to ethanol mills in
the northeast by 2014 to renew sugar-cane crops and help growers
recover from the worst drought in five decades.  Companies in the region will be eligible for 20 centavos of
government funds for every liter of fuel they sold in the
domestic market during the 2011-12 harvest season, Cid Jorge
Caldas, director of the  Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and
Food Supply ’s sugar cane and agroenergy department, said in a
telephone interview yesterday.  Some planters in particularly hard-hit regions including
northern Pernambuco state and southern Alagoas have seen more
than 40 percent of their crops wither due to lack of rain, he
said.  “If we don’t intervene then there’s going to be supply
problem” for ethanol in the region, Caldas said. “For the last
three years this drought has been getting worst and this last
year was especially brutal.”  The funds will be disbursed to about 45 mills that will be
required to prove how much ethanol they sold in the 2011-12
harvest by providing receipts, he said.  The government authorized the subsidies in May and a notice
published in the country’s official gazette July 10 approved
disbursement of the funds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
