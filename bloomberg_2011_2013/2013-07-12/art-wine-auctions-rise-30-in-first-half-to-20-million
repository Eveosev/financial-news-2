Wine auctions by Chicago-based Hart
Davis Hart Wine Co. rose 30 percent to $20 million in the first
half of this year as demand persisted for top Bordeaux and
Burgundy wines as well as rare Champagne.  A case of Chateau Lafite-Rothschild 1982 took the top slot
at its most recent auction at the end of June, selling for
$32,000, while a case of Dom Perignon Oenotheque 1969 Champagne
fetched $24,000, according to a statement from Hart.  The sale raised a total $4.75 million as Hart rounded off
its first-half auction season. The auction came as the Liv-ex
Fine Wine 50 Index, a barometer of Bordeaux prices in the wider
market, has risen 4 percent this year.  “I’m seeing good strength, better than we’ve seen in some
time,” Paul Hart, the auctioneer’s chief executive officer,
said by telephone from  Chicago .  Other leading lots in the sale included 11 bottles of Clos
de la Roche, Vieilles Vignes, Domaine Ponsot Burgundy which sold
for $28,000 and 10 bottles of Barolo Riserva 1978 Monfortino
Giacomo Conterno, which fetched $22,705.  Hart said that investor demand was buoyant in places such
as  Hong Kong ,  Brazil  and the U.S.  “We spend quite a lot of time in Brazil, and that market
is very strong,” he said.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
