Five cases of the 2010 vintage from
Chateau Montrose, a Bordeaux wine estate in Saint-Estephe, sold
for 1,416 pounds ($2,150) each on the London-based Liv-ex market
yesterday, rallying from a six-month low reached in June.  The sale was 2 percent above the mid-June level of 1,389
pounds, to which the vintage declined after a three-month slide
from its record 1,603 pounds a case in March.  The Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index tracking top Bordeaux
vintages has risen 4 percent this year, gaining in the first two
months and then falling during the second quarter as older
vintages including the 2010s competed with a sales campaign for
new wines.  “Bordeaux 2010 remained a focal point” Liv-ex said in its
monthly report published this week. “With an abundance of
supply, and some merchants looking to raise capital, the vintage
has been under pressure, creating buying opportunities.”  Chateau Montrose has been owned since 2006 by French
construction and media moguls Martin and Olivier Bouygues, who
run Paris-based  Bouygues SA. (EN)  The estate is ranked as a second-growth vineyard in the 1855 Bordeaux classification, putting it
among the top 20 in the Medoc region.  Montrose 2010 traded at 1,500 pounds in June 2011, soon
after it went on sale, and dropped as low as 1,161 pounds in
February the following year before recovering.  The 2010 Montrose is the estate’s third most expensive
vintage of the past decade, lagging the 2009 and 2003 wines,
according to merchant prices collated by Liv-ex. It scored 99
points out of 100 from U.S. wine critic  Robert Parker , making it
the third-highest rated of its wines over the past quarter-century, behind only the 2009 and 1990 vintages.  To contact the reporter on this story:
