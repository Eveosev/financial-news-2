Hoshino Resort Co., a 109-year-old
Japanese luxury hotel operator, wants to be as well known as
Toyota Motor Corp. internationally. President Yoshiharu Hoshino
says today’s real estate investment trust debut is a start.  “When I walk on the streets of New York or  London , I see
Toyota, Nissan and Honda cars driving around, but I don’t spot
any Japanese hotels,” Hoshino, 53, said in an interview in
Tokyo. “It’s my dream to become one of the choices in the
international tourism business.”  Hoshino Resorts REIT Inc. (3287)  will invest in Hoshino’s three
hotel brands, which are currently located only in  Japan , after
raising 10.2 billion yen ($103 million) in an initial public
offering. The REIT will buy six hotels for 15 billion yen from
the company, Hoshino said.  The REIT started trading at 570,000 yen, 12 percent higher
than the 510,000 yen IPO price. It was at 577,000 yen as of 9:24
a.m. local time on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.  Hoshino said that shifting ownership of the hotels to the
REIT will allow him to focus on managing the properties as the
company expands, including opening hotels overseas. Hoshino
Resort will use the IPO proceeds to upgrade its computer system,
strengthen its brand and hiring, the president said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
