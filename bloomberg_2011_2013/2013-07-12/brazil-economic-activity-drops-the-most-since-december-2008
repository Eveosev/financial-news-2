Brazil ’s economic activity in May
fell the most since December 2008, as accelerating inflation
slows consumption in the world’s second-largest emerging market.
Swap rates fell.  The seasonally adjusted economic activity  index , a proxy
for gross domestic product, fell 1.40 percent in May after
rising a revised 0.96 percent in April, the central bank said
today in a report posted on its website. It was the largest
decline since growth dropped 4.27 percent in December 2008.
Analysts expected a 1.15 percent contraction, according to the
median estimate of 22 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  President  Dilma Rousseff ’s administration is working to
combat inflation that has undercut economic growth by curbing
business sentiment and consumption. Industrial production in May
fell by 2 percent, while retail sales remained flat in the same
month. The central bank this week raised the benchmark  interest
rate  by 50 basis points for the second straight meeting, after
warning last month that the outlook for inflation remains
unfavorable.  The economic activity number “reinforces the idea that
Brazil’s economy is not growing,” Flavio Serrano, senior
economist at Banco Espirito Santo de Investimento, said by phone
from  Sao Paulo . “The market follows this number closely. It was
a weaker number than expected, and the swaps market is reacting
to that.”  Swap rates on the contract maturing in January 2015 fell
three basis points, or 0.03 percentage point, to 9.56 percent at
9:24 a.m. local time. The real weakened 0.3 percent to 2.2621
per  U.S. dollar .  Annual  inflation  in June quickened to 6.7 percent, the
fastest since October 2011, exceeding the ceiling of the bank’s
target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent.  The non-seasonally adjusted economic activity index rose
2.28 percent from a year ago, compared with a median estimate of
a 2.80 percent gain, the central bank report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
