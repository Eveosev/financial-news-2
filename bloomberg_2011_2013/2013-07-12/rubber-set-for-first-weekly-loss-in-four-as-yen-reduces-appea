Rubber declined, heading for the
first weekly loss in four, after Japan’s currency rebounded,
weakening the appeal of yen-denominated futures.  Rubber for delivery in December on the  Tokyo  Commodity
Exchange lost as much as 1.2 percent to 242.2 yen a kilogram
($2,440 a metric ton) after settling yesterday at the highest
level since July 5. Futures traded at 242.7 yen at 10:33 a.m.,
extending losses for this week to 1 percent.  The yen traded at 99.29 per dollar after climbing to 98.27
yesterday, the highest level since June 27. The Japanese
currency rebounded after Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  said on July 10 the world’s biggest economy will
continue to need stimulus for the foreseeable future.  “The remarks damped speculation that the Fed will start
curtailing its bond-buying program as early as September,
boosting the yen against the dollar and spurring sales of
futures in Tokyo,” Takaki Shigemoto, an analyst at research
company JSC Corp. in Tokyo, said by phone today.  Futures also declined as oil in  New York  fell for a second
day, he said. Synthetic rubber prices usually track changes on
crude oil.  Rubber for January delivery on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange lost 0.8 percent to 17,865  yuan  ($2,910) a ton. Thai
rubber free-on-board fell 1.1 percent to 79.85 baht ($2.57) a
kilogram yesterday, according to the Rubber Research Institute
of  Thailand .  To contact the reporter on this story:
