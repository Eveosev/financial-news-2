H&R Block Inc. (HRB) , the biggest U.S. tax
preparer, gained the most in five weeks after announcing a deal
to sell bank assets in an effort to exit Federal Reserve
oversight.  H&R Block jumped 69 cents, or 2.3 percent to $30.63 at 4:02
p.m. in New York. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company has
surged 65 percent this year.  The tax preparer said late yesterday that the deal with
Kentucky’s  Republic Bancorp Inc. (RBCAA)  will reduce earnings by about 6
cents to 9 cents a share on an annual basis.  Goldman Sachs Group
Inc. (GS)  was hired last year to evaluate options for H&R Block’s
banking unit amid new Fed rules requiring savings and loans to
hold more capital.  H&R Block will “trade off some profit for capital-allocation freedom,” Michael Millman of Millman Research
Associates said in a note to investors yesterday.  A Republic subsidiary will assume about $470 million in
customer deposits if regulators approve the deal, the
Louisville-based bank said yesterday in a separate statement.
The companies also are negotiating an agreement under which
Republic would provide H&R Block-branded financial
services to the tax firm’s customers.  To contact the reporter on this story:
