Spot wholesale power from
Connecticut to  Maine  rose as demand topped the grid operator’s
forecasts.  Prices reversed earlier losses as electricity use on the
six-state grid rose to 19,167 megawatts at 12:20 p.m., 0.7
percent higher than the forecast for the hour, according to ISO
New England Inc.’s website. Power load was below forecasts until
9:30 a.m.  The high temperature in  Boston  will be 76 degrees
Fahrenheit (24 Celsius), 6 below normal, according to
AccuWeather Inc. in the  State College ,  Pennsylvania . The
operator forecast that the moderate weather would cause a larger
drop in demand than occurred.  Spot electricity for Boston rose $10.79, or 31 percent, to
$46.01 a megawatt-hour during the hour ended at noon from the
same time yesterday, grid data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Yesterday’s day-ahead price for the hour was $43.49. The  on-peak
average  is down 32 percent at $30.09 so far today. On-peak hours
are Monday through Friday 7 a.m. until 11 p.m.  “New England was a little bit off on their forecast,”
said Kate Trischitta, director of trading at Consolidated Edison
Inc.’s wholesale energy trading division in New York. “You
haven’t seen anything major contribute to that, probably just
weather-related with a little bit of load hanging in there.”  Prices also gained in New York and the 13-state grid
operated by PJM Interconnection LLC, which stretches from  New
Jersey  into North Carolina and Chicago.  Manhattan Power  Spot power  for delivery to  Manhattan  and its four
neighboring boroughs was up $5.59, or 14 percent, at $46.84 a
megawatt-hour for the hour ended at noon. PJM’s benchmark
 Western hub , which includes prices from  Washington  to Erie,
Pennsylvania, was up $1.70, or 4.6 percent, at $38.87.  Prices may double next week in the Northeast as multiple
days of hot weather sweep parts of the East Coast, Trischitta
said. “Everybody is looking at next week today because there is
a big jump in the forecast,” she said.  Boston forward prices are trading at $70 a megawatt-hour
for July 15 and at $80 for remaining days of the work week,
while  New York  power is being valued in the $80s for the week,
Trischitta said.  The highs for Boston will reach 90 degrees, 8 higher than
the usual reading, on July 15 and stay in the 88- to 90-degree
range for the next three days, AccuWeather said. Washington’s
high will rise to 96 degrees on July 16, 7 above normal, and
hover in the low to mid-90s the rest of the week, the forecaster
said.  Peak demand  for  New York City  will climb to 10,409
megawatts on July 17, a 15 percent increase of today’s expected
high of 9,071 megawatts, data from the New York Independent
System Operator Inc. show. PJM expects  demand  on its grid to
jump to 149,577 megawatts on July 18, 33 percent above today’s
projected peak of 112,390 megawatts.  To contact the reporter on this story:
