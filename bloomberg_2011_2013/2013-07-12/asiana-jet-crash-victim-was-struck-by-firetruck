One of the two 16-year-old Chinese
girls who died after the  Asiana Airlines Inc. (020560)  plane crashed in
San Francisco was hit by a firetruck attending the scene, police
confirmed.  The victim was covered in fire-retardant foam, lying
prostrate on the ground near the fuselage, Gordon Shyy, a
spokesman for the San Francisco Police Department, said in a
telephone interview today.  “We do not know that the firetruck was the actual cause of
death,” Shyy said. Shyy also said he didn’t know which victim
was struck.  All but two of the 307 people on board flight 214 survived
the July 6 crash-landing, the first fatal airline accident in
the U.S. since 2009. The two girls, Ye Meng  Yuan  and Wang Lin
Jia, were on their way to a summer camp in the U.S.  To contact the reporter on this story:
