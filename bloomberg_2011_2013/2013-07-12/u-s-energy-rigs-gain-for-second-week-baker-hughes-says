Oil and gas  rigs  in the U.S. rose
for a second week, increasing by two to 1,759, according to
 Baker Hughes Inc. (BHI)   Oil rigs  were down four at 1,391,  gas rigs  advanced by
seven to 362 and miscellaneous rigs slipped one to six, the
Houston-based field services company said on its website. Gas
rigs reached an 11-week high.  The  total count  was unchanged in the second quarter after
five consecutive declines, and June was the most active month
for U.S. land drilling permits in more than a year, suggesting a
rebound in activity, according to  Barclays Plc. (BARC)   Oil and gas wells increased about 10 percent in the first
quarter and probably rose again in the second, “suggesting that
rig count moves are severely lagging well count improvements and
overall increases in industry capacity,” James West, an analyst
for the Barclays investment-banking unit in New York, said in
the note July 8.  Natural gas for August delivery rose 3 cents to $3.643 per
million British thermal units at 1:13 p.m. on the New York
Mercantile Exchange, up 27 percent from a year ago.  U.S. gas stockpiles  gained 82 billion cubic feet in the
week ended July 5 to 2.687 trillion, above the five-year average
injection for the week of 74 billion, the Energy Information
Administration, the Energy Department’s statistical arm, said
yesterday. Supplies were 14 percent below year-earlier levels.  U.S. oil output climbed 1.8 percent to 7.4 million barrels
a day last week, the most since January 1992, EIA data show.
Stockpiles fell 2.6 percent to 373.9 million barrels.  Crude for August delivery rose 80 cents, or 0.8 percent, to
$105.71 a barrel today on the Nymex, up 23 percent in the past
year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
