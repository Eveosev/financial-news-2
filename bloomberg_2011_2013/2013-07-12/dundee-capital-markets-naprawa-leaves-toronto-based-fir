Dundee Capital Markets Inc.’s Chris Naprawa, head of institutional sales, said he departed the
Toronto-based company owned by  Dundee Corp. (DC/A)   “I’ve left the firm,” Naprawa said today in a telephone
interview. “It was just an internal decision. I’m happy with
it, they’re happy with it and everyone’s good.”  Naprawa’s departure from the commodity-focused dealer,
along with sales colleague Chris Motherwell, was reported
earlier today by the Globe and Mail. Sean Cooney, an energy
investment banking analyst in Calgary, and Lindsay Weiss, an
agriculture-focused managing director in the mergers department,
also are no longer with the firm, the Globe said.  A message left at Dundee’s office wasn’t immediately
returned. Weiss declined to comment, while a message sent to
Cooney through LinkedIn.com wasn’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporter on this story:
