The European Medicines Agency 
appealed rulings that blocked it from releasing clinical-trial
data from  AbbVie Inc. (ABBV)  and biotechnology company  InterMune Inc. (ITMN) 
at the European Union’s highest court.  EMA is challenging a lower EU tribunal’s decisions to block
the data release while AbbVie’s and InterMune’s main appeals
were pending. EMA’s appeal was filed with the EU Court of
Justice on July 5, according to the Luxembourg-based court’s
website.  The EU regulator promised in 2010 to bolster its
transparency by disclosing, on demand, clinical trial data for
every drug reviewed. Drug safety activists pressed for the move
amid concerns over suicide risks linked to  Sanofi (SAN) ’s failed diet
pill Acomplia.  AbbVie declined to comment on the appeal, Gwenan White, a
spokeswoman in the company’s U.K. office, said in a telephone
interview. EMA spokeswoman Monika Benstetter declined to
immediately comment.  The cases are: C-389/13 P, EMA v. AbbVie, C-390/13 P, EMA
v. InterMune U.K. and Others.  To contact the reporter on this story:
