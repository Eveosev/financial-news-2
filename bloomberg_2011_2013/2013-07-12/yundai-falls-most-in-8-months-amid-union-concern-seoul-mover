Hyundai Motor Co. (005380) , South Korea’s
largest automaker, slumped the most in more than eight months as
wage negotiations with its union failed to make progress and
amid concern Chinese vehicle demand will fall.  Hyundai tumbled 5.9 percent, the most since Nov. 5, to
209,000 won as of 2:54 p.m. Seoul time, while affiliate  Kia
Motors Corp. (000270)  fell 5.2 percent. The benchmark Kospi  index  dropped
0.6 percent.  No progress had been made following a 13th round of wage
negotiations yesterday, Hyundai’s union said in a statement on
its website. The next meeting is scheduled for July 16. The
 China  Association of Automobile Manufacturers said July 10 that
eight cities will probably introduce measures limiting auto
purchases, in a move aimed at curbing pollution and congestion.
China accounted for more than 19 percent of Hyundai’s sales last
year, according to data from its website.  “The shares are reacting to two reports,” said Shin Chung Kwan, an analyst at KB Investment & Securities. “One, on
concern that China’s increasing limits on car purchases may cut
demand for Hyundai, and two, on the likelihood of the company’s
union going on strike over wages.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
