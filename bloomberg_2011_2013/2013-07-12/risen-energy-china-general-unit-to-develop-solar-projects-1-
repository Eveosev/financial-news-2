(Corrects company name in headline.)  Risen Energy (300118)  Co., a Chinese maker of
solar panels, plans to develop 100 megawatts of power projects
with a unit of  China  General Nuclear Power Group.  The solar farms will be build in China’s Ningbo city and
Hubei and Jiangxi provinces, Risen said yesterday in a statement
to the Shenzhen stock exchange. Financial terms weren’t
disclosed.  CGN Solar Energy Development Co., a unit of China General
Nuclear Power, will hold an 80 percent stake in the projects
with the remainder owned by Risen.  The cooperation will boost sales and may have a
“positive” impact on future earnings, said Risen.  To contact the reporter on this story:
