The krone extended its biggest
weekly gain against the euro in eight months on speculation that
 Norway ’s economy will outperform its European counterparts.  The Norwegian currency strengthened versus all 16 of its
major peers in the week amid signs central banks will persist
with measures to stimulate the economy, boosting demand for
higher-yielding assets. Against the dollar, the krone headed for
its biggest weekly advance since October 2011, after Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said two days ago that highly
accommodative monetary policy was still needed in the U.S.  “Norway is still stronger than pretty much anywhere else
in the world,” said Christian Lawrence, foreign-exchange
strategist at Rabobank International in  London . The krone will
continue appreciating over the course of the year, he said.  Norway’s currency strengthened 0.3 percent to 7.9204 per
euro at 5:03 p.m. London time. It climbed 1.3 percent from July
5, the biggest advance since the five days through Nov. 2. The
krone was little changed at 6.0707 per dollar, rising 3 percent
in the week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
