A shareholder request to block  OGX
Petroleo & Gas Participacoes SA (OGXP3)  from selling assets and making
payments to companies affiliated with billionaire controller
 Eike Batista  was rejected by a court in Rio de Janeiro.  Judge Maria Isabel Paes Goncalves denied the injunction,
citing insufficient evidence to intervene in the company’s
operations, according to a  decision  posted on the court’s
website yesterday. The case was submitted by Rio lawyer and
professor Jorge Lobo on behalf of his son Marcio Lobo, who owns
84,000 shares in the oil company.  “At the moment, I am convinced that making the company’s
assets unavailable would bring more problems than solutions,”
Goncalves said in the decision.  Batista’s six publicly traded companies have lost about $10
billion in market value between them this year, led by an 87
percent drop in OGX. The explorer is only producing a fraction
of original targets at its first offshore oil project and may
shut it next year, the company said July 1. It is also
abandoning oil fields it previously declared commercial in the
same area of the Campos Basin.  OGX won additional exploration licenses in a May 14 auction
and expects to have the “necessary conditions” to pay a
signing bonus within the deadline, the company said in a filing
yesterday. It has consulted with  Brazil ’s oil regulator about
using future production as a guarantee for the areas, OGX said.  The case is 0236942-88.2013.8.19.0001, according to the Rio
Judiciary’s  website .  To contact the reporter on this story:
