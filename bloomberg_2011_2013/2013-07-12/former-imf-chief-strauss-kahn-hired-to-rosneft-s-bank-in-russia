Dominique Strauss-Kahn , the former
head of the International Monetary Fund, was appointed to the
supervisory board of the Russia Regional Development Bank, owned
by oil producer  OAO Rosneft (ROSN) , according to a regulatory filing
from the lender.  Strauss-Kahn left the IMF in 2011 after facing allegations
of the attempted rape of a hotel maid in New York. He denied the
charges, which were later dropped, and he settled the maid’s
lawsuit last year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
