Starboard Value LP, the activist
investor urging  Smithfield Foods Inc. (SFD)  to consider a breakup,
hired Moelis & Co. and BDA Advisors Inc. as financial advisers.  The two firms will be paid a fee based on the appreciation
of Starboard’s stake in Smithfield above the $34-a-share offer
from  China ’s Shuanghui International Holdings Ltd., Starboard
said today in a filing.  Shuanghui agreed to acquire Smithfield for $4.7 billion in
May in a deal that would give it the world’s largest hog
producer. A breakup of the Smithfield, Virginia-based company
may value it at about $44 to $55 a share, Starboard, which holds
a 5.7 percent stake, wrote in a June 17 letter.  Smithfield closed unchanged today at $32.91 in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
