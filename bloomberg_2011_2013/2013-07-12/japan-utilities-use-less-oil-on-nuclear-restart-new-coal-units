Japan ’s utilities used less  crude 
and fuel oil in June as the operation of two nuclear reactors
and new coal-fired units helped them reduce reliance on more-expensive sources.  Japan’s 10 regional power utilities consumed about 770,000
kiloliters of crude in June, down 27 percent from a year
earlier, according to data released today by the  Federation of
Electric Power Cos. of Japan . Fuel oil usage fell 37 percent to
about 744,000 kiloliters, the data shows.  Japan had no nuclear output in June last year as all of the
country’s 50 reactors were shut for safety checks after the
Fukushima disaster in March 2011. Consumption of crude and fuel
oil fell last month as Kansai Electric Power Co. restarted two
reactors last July and Tokyo Electric Power Co. began test
operations of two coal-fired facilities in April this year.  The 10 regional companies generated and purchased 70.91
billion kilowatt-hours of electricity last month, up 0.6 percent
from a year earlier, according to the data. Warmer temperatures
raised electricity demand for air conditioning, the federation
said in a statement.  The following table shows Japanese utilities’ consumption
and purchases of fuel oil, crude, LNG and coal in June. Fuel oil
and crude volumes are in kiloliters, while those for LNG and
coal are in tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
