U.K. commercial real estate values
rose for the second straight month in June, led by increasing
demand for investments outside of  London , Investment Property
Databank Ltd. said.  The average value of stores, offices and warehouses climbed
0.2 percent from a month earlier, London-based IPD said in a
statement today. Total return, which combines changes in real
estate values and rental income, was 0.8 percent last month, the
most since March 2011.  “While central London continues to be the powerhouse of
performance, it is the regional advances that are tipping the
balance and leading to an overall improvement in values,” Phil
Tily, a managing director at IPD, said in the statement. “As
the U.K. economy slowly picks up, incrementally, so does
property performance.”  The commercial property market is improving as lenders
become more willing to provide credit to borrowers and overseas
buyers look beyond London for real estate purchases. U.K.
manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in two years in June and
services unexpectedly accelerated by the most in more than two
years, potentially boosting demand for property, reports this
month showed.  Office property values had a 0.5 percent gain in June, the
same as warehouses, according to IPD. The value of retail
properties fell 0.1 percent. Income producing commercial
property prices fell for 17 consecutive months through March.  To contact the reporter on this story:
