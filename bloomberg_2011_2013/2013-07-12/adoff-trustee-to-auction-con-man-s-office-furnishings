The trustee liquidating  Bernard
Madoff ’s brokerage will sell furniture and decorations from the
imprisoned con man’s former offices in Manhattan’s Lipstick
Building and in Queens, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan yesterday.  The trustee gave no estimated value for the items, which
include conference tables, a plaque from the Toys for Tots
charity, a picture of a sailboat, executive and beach chairs, a
broken antique wooden table and 15 Herman Miller black mesh
rolling office chairs. The auction house proposed to handle the
sales is Stair Galleries, which with  Sotheby’s (BID)  will sell the
Madoff brokerage’s art in the fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
