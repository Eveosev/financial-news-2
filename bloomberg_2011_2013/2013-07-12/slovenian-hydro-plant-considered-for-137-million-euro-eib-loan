The  European Investment Bank  is
considering loaning about 137 million euros ($179 million) for a
hydroelectric plant in Slovenia to help the nation boost its
power from renewable sources.  The loan will finance construction of the 276 million-euro
Brezice facility and connected infrastructure, according to a
statement today on the Luxembourg-based bank’s website.
Hidroelektrarne na Spodnji Savi doo, the nation’s hydropower
developer, is building the plant on the Sava River.  The venture will provide about 165 gigawatt-hours of power
a year and boost flood protection in the region, according to
the bank’s statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
