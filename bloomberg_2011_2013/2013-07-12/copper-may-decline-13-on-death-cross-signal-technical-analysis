Copper in  London  may extend losses
by 13 percent over the next two months to the lowest level since
2010 after moving averages formed a death cross, according to
technical analysis by Trading Central SA.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange may drop to $6,050 a metric ton, said Ludwig Garric,
head of Commodity Research at the Paris-based company, who
correctly predicted the rally in soybeans to a record last year.  “The 20-day, 50-day and 100-day moving averages are
heading downward, the shorter below the longer ones, signaling a
downtrend,” Garric said by e-mail. Prices are also capped by a
declining trend line, he added.  The 50-day moving average has been below the 200-day moving
average since April 11 and the 100-day moving average has been
below the 200-day measure since April 30, forming a death cross,
a bearish technical indicator, said Garric.  Copper has plunged 12 percent this year on concern demand
will weaken as the economy slows in  China , the world’s top
consumer. The contract for delivery in three months fell 0.3
percent to $6,980.25 a ton at 11:15 a.m. in  Singapore .  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
