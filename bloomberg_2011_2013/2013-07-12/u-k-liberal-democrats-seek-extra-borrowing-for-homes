The U.K. Liberal Democrat party will
call for local authorities that want to increase their borrowing
in order to build more homes to be allowed to take up the unused
loan capacity of other districts.  Business Secretary Vince Cable will set out the idea today
in a speech in Manchester, northwest  England . He’ll say that
local government isn’t using 2.8 billion pounds ($4.3 billion)
of the borrowing capacity allowed it by central government,
because some councils are opting not to build.  “Councils which want to borrow and build should be allowed
to use unused borrowing limits from councils which didn’t wish
to utilize theirs,” Cable will say, according to his office.
“It is a modest step, but it opens up the possibility of
sensible public borrowing to revive the depressed  construction
industry  and to meet desperate housing need.”  The business secretary will argue that it’s the “dogma”
of his Conservative coalition colleagues that’s preventing the
rule change. “Even though freeing up this borrowing space would
result in tens of thousands more homes being built, and many
times more jobs, they would rather start talking about the cuts
they want to make, rather than the houses that we should
build,” he’ll say.  To contact the reporter on this story:
