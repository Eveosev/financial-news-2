The Vatican may extend its probe of
suspicious  bank transactions  to people beyond Nunzio Scarano,
the prelate arrested last month by Italian authorities on
charges of fraud and corruption, Ansa reported.  The Vatican froze Scaranoâ€™s funds at its bank, known as the
Institute for Works of Religion, or IOR, Ansa reported, citing
Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi.  Scarano has denied accusations against him.  To contact the reporter on this story:
