     July 12 (Bloomberg) -- Boeing Co. dropped as much as 6.8
percent after the U.K.’s Sky TV reported a parked 787 Dreamliner
had caught fire at  London ’s  Heathrow Airport .  Sky TV showed the Ethiopian Air plane being sprayed with
foam. No passengers were on board.  Dreamliners around the world were ordered parked in January
after two battery meltdowns, the first such grounding in the
U.S. for an entire model since 1979. Among the eight Dreamliner
operators, Ethiopian Airlines Enterprise began flying again in
April while Qatar Airways Ltd., Air India Ltd. and United
Continental Holdings Inc. resumed service in May.   Boeing fell as low as $99.60 and dropped 5.3 percent to
$101.25 at 12:31 p.m. in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
