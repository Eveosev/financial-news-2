Canadian  stocks  fell, following the
biggest rally in 11 months, as raw-materials companies declined
amid signs  China  may tolerate slower growth and a U.S. Federal
Reserve official urged slower stimulus.  Pretium Resources Inc. lost 4 percent and Alamos Gold Inc.
dropped 3.7 percent as falling metals prices weighed on raw-materials producers. Catamaran Corp. added 0.9 percent, pacing
gains among health-care companies. Niko Resources Ltd. surged
3.4 percent after entering an agreement for a $60 million loan.  The  Standard & Poor’s/TSX Composite Index (SPTSX)  fell 31.09
points, or 0.3 percent, to 12,462.17 at 4 p.m. in Toronto,
erasing an earlier gain of 0.2 percent. The loss pared the
index’s weekly gain to 2.7 percent, its biggest five-day advance
since November. Trading was 27 percent below the 30-day average.  “It has been a zigzag worth of news coming out from the
Fed,” said  Irwin Michael ,  fund manager  with ABC Funds in
Toronto. He helps manage about C$800 million ($759 million).
“The market is moving on how people are processing the
information coming out.”  The benchmark gauge jumped the most since August 2012
yesterday, erasing a loss for the year, after Fed Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  backed sustained monetary stimulus for the economy
of Canada’s biggest trading partner. Stocks slumped today after
Philadelphia Fed Bank President  Charles Plosser  said the central
bank should begin tapering its $85 billion in monthly bond
buying in September and end the stimulus by year-end.  China Economy  China’s Finance Minister,  Lou Jiwei , speaking yesterday at
the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue in  Washington ,
said he remains confident of achieving a 7 percent growth rate
this year. That’s lower than the government’s target for 2013 of
7.5 percent. A report due on July 15 may show economic growth
slowed for a second quarter in the three months ended March 31.
China, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals and
energy, is Canada’s second-largest trading partner.  Six of the gauge’s ten groups declined. Raw-materials
producers lost the most, falling 1.7 percent, as prices for
metals from silver to copper dropped.  Pretium Resources, a diversified miner, slid 4 percent to
C$7.52. Alamos Gold tumbled 3.7 percent to C$13.41 after
agreeing to buy precious metals producer Esperanza Resources
Corp. for about C$69.4 million.  Health-care companies gained the most, as Catamaran Corp.
added 0.9 percent to C$51.16.  Railroad companies drove industrial stocks up 0.5 percent
after BMO analyst  Fadi Chamoun  wrote in a note that railroads’
market share in heavy crude oil shipments will “materially
increase” over the next two years.  Canadian National Railway Co. (CNR)  added 0.9 percent to C$104.93
and Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. rose 1.7 percent to C$131.73.  Niko Resources surged 3.4 percent to $8.64 after the
company entered an agreement for a $60 million loan that will be
funded by a group of institutional investors. Net proceeds from
the loan will be used to fund working capital requirements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
