The lawyer for George Zimmerman,
accused of murder in the shooting death of Trayvon Martin, told
the jury that the Neighborhood Watch volunteer was protecting
himself from the youth.  “He’s not guilty of anything except protecting his own
life,” Mark O’Mara, the attorney, told the jury of six women in
Sanford,  Florida , today in closing arguments.  Zimmerman is charged with second-degree murder. He claims
self-defense.  O’Mara told jurors they may not fill in the gaps in the
prosecution’s case in deciding whether to convict Zimmerman of
second-degree murder or manslaughter.  “Assumptions presume a lack of evidence,” the attorney
said. “If you don’t know it, it hasn’t been proven. You can’t
fill in the gaps. You can’t fill in the dots for the state
attorney’s office. You’re not allowed to.”  Zimmerman, 29, told the police he acted in self-defense the
night of Feb. 26, 2012, after Martin, 17, punched him in the
face, knocked him to the ground and threatened to kill him. At
the time of the shooting, Martin was carrying a can of iced tea,
a bag of Skittles and $40 in cash.  The case is State of Florida v. Zimmerman, 1712FO4573,
Florida Circuit Court, 18th Judicial Circuit, Seminole County
(Sanford).  To contact the reporters on this story:
