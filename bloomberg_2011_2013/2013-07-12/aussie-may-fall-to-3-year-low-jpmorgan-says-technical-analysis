The Australian dollar may fall to
its lowest level in almost three years after breaching a key
level of support, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co., citing
technical indicators.  The Aussie may decline to 87.70 U.S. cents, its weakest
level since July 22, 2010, after falling below minor support at
90, according to Niall O’Connor, a New York-based technical
analyst at JPMorgan.  Australia ’s currency weakened to less than
90 today for the first time since September 2010. The Aussie has
been the worst-performing major currency over the last six
months, decreasing 14 percent versus the  U.S. dollar .  “Today’s decline suggests a higher risk for new lows into
next week,” O’Connor wrote in an e-mail. “Deeper targets enter
at the 87.70-to-88.80 zone. It should try to bounce from
there.” The target zone represents the 76.4 percent Fibonacci
retracement from the 2010 low, O’Connor said.  Australia’s currency depreciated 1.4 percent to 90.61 U.S.
cents at 10:51 a.m. in New York after earlier falling as much as
2.1 percent to 89.99.  In  technical analysis , investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
currency or index. Resistance refers to an area on a chart where
sell orders may be gathered, and support is an area where there
may be buy orders.  Fibonacci analysis, based on the work of 13th century
mathematician Leonardo of Pisa, known as Fibonacci, is founded
on the theory that prices rise or fall by certain percentages
after reaching a new high or low.  To contact the reporter on this story:
