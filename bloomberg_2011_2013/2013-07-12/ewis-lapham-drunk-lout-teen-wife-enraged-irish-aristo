Everyone should have the same
opportunities to get ahead in business, the professions and
politics. It’s not happening because men reserve power and

female sex is less intelligent, more emotional and essentially

Thompson , a privileged and well-educated Irishman, in “Appeal
of One-Half of the Human Race, Women, Against the Pretensions of
the Other Half, Men, to Retain them in Political, and Thence in
Civil and Domestic Slavery.”  Thompson wrote the work in 1825, inspired by the fate of
Anna Wheeler. She was married at 15 and bore six children before
fleeing to France from her drunken husband.  I spoke with David Cannadine, author of “The Undivided
Past: Humanity Beyond Our Differences,” on the following
topics:  1. Religious Conflict  2. Class Struggle  3. Racial Division  4. War Between the Sexes  5. Shared Humanity  To buy this book in North America, click  here .  ( Lewis Lapham  is the founder of  Lapham’s Quarterly  and the
