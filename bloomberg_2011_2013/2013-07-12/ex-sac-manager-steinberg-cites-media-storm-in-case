A lawyer for former SAC Capital
Advisors LP fund manager Michael Steinberg told a federal judge
that the “media storm” of coverage about his case and founder
 Steven A. Cohen  may hurt his chances of getting a fair trial.  Barry Berke, the lawyer, today asked U.S. District Judge
Richard Sullivan in Manhattan to use a questionnaire and closely
question potential jurors about media accounts and publicity
surrounding the case when a jury is selected for Steinberg’s
 insider-trading  trial, set to begin in November.  Berke said that hundreds of articles have been written
about his client’s case, which is far different from the related
insider-trading trial of Level Global Investors LP co-founder
Anthony Chiasson and his co-defendant, former Diamondback
Capital Management LLC fund manager  Todd Newman , who were
convicted of insider trading in December.  “I do think the press is different from the Chiasson
trial,” Berke told the judge today. “There has been a lot of
extraneous information that has been written about this case,
SAC,  Steve Cohen , SAC people who’ve pleaded guilty and other
rumors.”  The case is U.S. v. Steinberg, 12-cr-00121, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
