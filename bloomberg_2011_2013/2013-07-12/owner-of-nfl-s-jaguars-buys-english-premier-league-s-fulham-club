The owner of the National Football
League’s Jacksonville Jaguars has bought Fulham soccer club,
becoming the sixth American to own an English Premier League
team.  Shahid Khan , the owner of auto-parts maker Flex-N-Gate
Corp. who bought the Jaguars in 2011, purchased 100 percent of
Fulham, the club said yesterday on its website.  Khan purchased the club, which finished 12th in the 20-team
league last season, from Mohamed Al Fayed. Details of the deal
were not released by the club, which said the transaction has
been approved by the league.  The Jaguars will play a regular-season game annually at
London’s Wembley Stadium for the next four seasons, including a
game Oct. 27 this coming season against the  San Francisco 49ers .  “Fulham is the perfect club at the perfect time for me,”
Khan said. “I do not view myself so much as the owner of
Fulham, but a custodian of the club on behalf of its fans.”  Al Fayed, 84, the former owner of Harrods department store,
had owned Fulham since 1997. He said the club “will be in very
good hands with Shahid, whose success in business and passion
for sport is very evident.”  Manchester United , Arsenal, Liverpool,  Aston Villa  and
Sunderland are the other five Premier League clubs with American
owners.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
