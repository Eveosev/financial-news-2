Alberto Contador cut into Chris Froome’s overall lead by more than a minute as Mark Cavendish
won a windy stage 13 of the Tour de  France .  Omega Pharma’s Cavendish outsprinted Cannondale’s Peter
Sagan at the end of the 173-kilometer (108-mile) ride yesterday
from Tours to Saint-Amand-Montrond for his second stage win of
this year’s tour and the 25th in his career.  “We knew the wind was strong, strong enough to break”
from the peloton, Cavendish said. “The guys just rode out of
their skins.”  The riders go 191 kilometers today from Saint-Pourcain-sur-Sioule to Lyon. The Tour, which covers 2,116 miles, ends July 21
in Paris.  Omega Pharma made its break at around 100 kilometers in
yesterday’s stage. Contador’s Saxo Bank team made another break
about 30 kilometers from the finish, and averaged 47.2
kilometers an hour during the ride. Team Sky’s Froome, a Kenyan-born Briton, started the day with a 3-minute, 25-second lead
over Movistar’s Alejandro Valverde of Spain, with Belkin’s Bauke
Mollema of the Netherlands another 12 seconds back.  Mollema is now in second, 2:28 behind, while Contador is
2:45 behind Froome. Valverde dropped to 9:54 behind Froome.  To contact the reporter on this story:
