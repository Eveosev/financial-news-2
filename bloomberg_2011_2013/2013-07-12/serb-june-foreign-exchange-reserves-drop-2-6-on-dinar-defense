Serbia ’s foreign-currency reserves
fell for a third month as the central bank propped up the dinar
and the government repaid debt, the central bank said.  The reserves dropped to 10.67 billion euros ($13.9 billion)
from 10.96 billion euros in May, Belgrade-based Narodna Banka
Srbije said in an e-mailed statement today. Inflows included an
increase in banks’ mandatory reserves by 242.4 million euros,
the government borrowing of 63 million euros and 65 million
euros from loans and grants.  The National Bank of Serbia sold 270 million euros in June
to prop up the dinar, which depreciated a nominal 2.2 percent
against the euro, while the government repaid 157.6 million
euros of debt, including 46 million euros to the International
Monetary Fund.  Net reserves, excluding the money commercial lenders keep
with the central bank and funds from the IMF, dropped to 6.74
billion euros from 7.19 billion euros in May, the bank said.  Interbank foreign-currency trading rose 66 percent on the
month to 1.14 billion euros, bringing the six-month total to
5.26 billion, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
