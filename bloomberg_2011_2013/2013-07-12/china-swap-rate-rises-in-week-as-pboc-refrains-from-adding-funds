China ’s one-year interest-rate swap
climbed this week on speculation the central bank will refrain
from adding funds to markets after inflation quickened in June.  The People’s Bank of China didn’t inject capital into the
financial system this week for the first time since May,  data 
compiled by Bloomberg show.  Consumer prices  in Asia’s largest
economy rose 2.7 percent in June from a year earlier, the most
in four months, official figures showed July 9.  “The market is not optimistic about liquidity in the
future,” said Song Qiuhong, a bond analyst at Foshan Shunde
Rural Commercial Bank Co. in Foshan, a city in the southern
province of Guangdong.  The one-year swap contract, the fixed cost needed to
receive the floating seven-day repurchase rate, increased nine
basis points this week to 3.91 percent as of 10:56 a.m. in
 Shanghai , according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The rate rose
one basis point today.  The seven-day  repurchase rate , which measures interbank
funding availability, declined four basis points from a week ago
and one basis point today to 3.79 percent, according to a
weighted average rate compiled by the National Interbank Funding
Center.  The central bank sold 50 billion yuan ($8.1 billion) of
six-month deposits yesterday on behalf of the Ministry of
Finance at a yield of 5.01 percent, said a trader at a primary
dealer required to bid at the auctions. That compares with 6.5
percent in June and 4.8 percent in May. The PBOC plans to sell
50 billion  yuan  of three-month deposits on July 18.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
