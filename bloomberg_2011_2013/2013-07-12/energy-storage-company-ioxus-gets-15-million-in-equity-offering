Ioxus Inc., a closely held maker of
energy-storage devices, received $15 million in an equity
offering with six unnamed investors, according to a filing.  The company is seeking to raise $20 million, according to a
document filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
today. Chief Financial Officer Henry Barber didnâ€™t immediately
return a phone message seeking comment.  Ioxus, based in Oneonta, New York, is backed by Braemar
Energy Ventures, Northwater Capital Management Inc., Aster
Capital and Energy Technology Ventures, a joint venture between
General Electric Co., ConocoPhillips and NRG Energy Inc.  Aster 
is sponsored by Alstom SA, Schneider Electric SA and Solvay SA,
according to its website.  The company makes ultracapacitors that rapidly absorb and
release high-voltage power, according to its website. The
devices can store power generated by solar and wind farms or be
paired with batteries in electric vehicles to capture energy
from braking.  To contact the reporter on this story:
