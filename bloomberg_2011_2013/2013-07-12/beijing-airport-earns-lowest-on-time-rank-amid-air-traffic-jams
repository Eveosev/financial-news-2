Beijing’s main airport had the
lowest ranking for on-time departures last month with less than
one in five flights leaving on schedule as military controls of
airspace and an expanding fleet add to congestion.  Shanghai had the second-worst among the 35 busiest
international airports in June, according to rankings by
industry researcher  FlightStats Inc.  Tokyo’s Haneda airport was
the top performer with 95 percent of flights leaving on time,
followed by the Japanese capital’s Narita.  About 18 percent of 22,019 flights departing from  Beijing
Capital (694)  International Airport were on time, while Shanghai
 Pudong International airport  had a rate of about 29 percent,
Portland, Oregon-based FlightStats said. FlightStats records a
delay if an aircraft fails to take off within 15 minutes of the
scheduled gate time.  Air China Ltd. (601111) ,  China Eastern Airlines Corp. (670)  and other
carriers have expanded their fleets as economic growth spurs
 travel demand  in China, where the  air force  allots only 20
percent of air space to civil aviation. Traffic congestion is
set to worsen as the nation’s commercial aircraft fleet is
projected to double in the next seven years.  China is expected to have 4,200 commercial aircraft in
2020, compared with the current fleet size of 2,001 with 46
airlines,  Li Jiaxiang , head of the Civil Aviation Administration
of China, said in May.  JFK, Heathrow  More than 42 percent of flights at Beijing airports
