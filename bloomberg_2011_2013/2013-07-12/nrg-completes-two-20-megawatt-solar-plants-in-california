NRG Energy Inc. (NRG) , the largest
independent U.S. electricity generator, completed two 20-megawatt solar farms in California that sell power to the
state’s two largest utilities.  The Kansas South project in Kings County began delivering
power last month and the TA-High Desert project in Lancaster,
California, went into operation in March, NRG said today in a
statement.  NRG, based in Princeton, New Jersey, bought the projects
this year from Sharp Corp.’s Recurrent Energy.  PG&E Corp. (PCG) ’s
Pacific Gas and Electric is buying the power from Kansas South
and  Edison International (EIX) ’s Southern California Edison has a
contract for energy from TA-High Desert.  The price the utilities are paying for the power wasn’t
disclosed in the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
