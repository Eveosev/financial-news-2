The trustee liquidating   Bernard
Madoff ’s brokerage will sell furniture and decorations from the
imprisoned con man’s former offices in Manhattan’s Lipstick
Building and in Queens, according to a filing in U.S. Bankruptcy
Court in Manhattan yesterday.  He gave no estimated value for the items, which include
conference tables, a plaque identifying the brokerage from Toys
for Tots, a picture of a sailboat, executive and beach chairs, a
broken antique wooden table and 15 Herman Miller black mesh
rolling office chairs. The proposed auction house is Stair
Galleries, which with Sotheby’s will sell the Madoff brokerage’s
art in the fall.  To contact the reporter on this story:
