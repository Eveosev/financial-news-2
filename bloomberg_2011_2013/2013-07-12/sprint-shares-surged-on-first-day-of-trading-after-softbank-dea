Sprint Corp. (S)  advanced in its first
day of trading since closing the $21.6 billion takeover by
SoftBank after getting an upgrade to strong buy from Janco
Partners Inc.  The SoftBank deal, and more importantly the acquisition of
the remaining portion of wireless carrier Clearwire Corp. that
Sprint didn’t already own, gives Sprint some key advantages,
said Gerard Hallaren, a Janco analyst.  “They stole Clearwire’s spectrum,” Hallaren said.
“There’s a huge amount of value in those airwaves that they got
extremely cheap,” he said.  Sprint closed up 2.7 percent to $6.45 in New York, after
earlier gaining as much as 14 percent.  The mobile-phone company yesterday guaranteed its offer of
unlimited calling, text and data service for the life of a
customer’s contract. Unlimited plans have helped Overland Park,
Kansas-based Sprint stand out from  Verizon Wireless  and  AT&T
Inc. (T) , which have pushed tiered data pricing.  Sprint still has to catch up with rivals on its long-term
evolution, or LTE, network upgrades before it can compete on
equal footing with Verizon and AT&T,  Phil Cusick , a JPMorgan
Chase & Co. analyst, wrote in a note today.  “Without a solid network to sell in most cities yet, we
see little upside in SoftBank driving Sprint to get more
aggressive on handset or service pricing nationwide,” Cusick
wrote.  To contact the reporter on this story:
