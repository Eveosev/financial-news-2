China ’s train and rail-equipment
companies surged in Hong Kong trading on a  Shanghai  Securities
News report that the government may resume tenders to supply
bullet trains.  China Railway Group Ltd. (390)  advanced as much as 9.6 percent to
HK$3.76 in Hong Kong, and  China Railway Construction Corp. (1186) 
jumped as much as 10.3 percent to HK$6.97 as of 1:44 p.m. local
time. The two companies are the biggest Chinese builders of rail
and metro lines.  China, which has the world’s biggest high-speed rail
network, may start taking bids to supply bullet trains in the
second half, Shanghai Securities News reported today, citing an
unidentified rail transportation-equipment company. Orders were
withheld last year because of the nation’s leadership
transition, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.  “This is a short-term positive for train providers as
there will be an increase in orders,” Li Kun, an analyst at
Northeast Securities Co., said by phone.  China will budget 650 billion  yuan  ($106 billion) in 2013
on rail-related fixed-asset investment, more than the 631
billion yuan spent last year, Rail Minister Sheng Guangzu said
in January, according to Xinhua News Agency.  The government could start accepting bids for high-speed
trains as early as August, according to Xu Minle, an analyst at
Bank of China International Ltd. in Shanghai.  The Ministry of Railways was dismantled earlier this year
as the government sought to rein in graft and red tape. It was
divided into two entities, and a new company China Railway Corp.
was formed to take over commercial operations.  Wenzhou Crash  The reform comes after allegations of corruption
surrounding rail construction, along with a 2011 bullet-train
crash in the eastern city of Wenzhou that killed 40 people.
Former Railway Minister Liu Zhijun was given a suspended death
sentence on July 8 for abuse of power and taking bribes.  The development of the railroad network could help absorb
overcapacity in steel and cement industries, 21st Century
Business Herald reported today, citing unidentified people close
to China Railway Corp. Rail infrastructure investment this year
may exceed by “a little” the 520 billion yuan target set by
the former railway ministry, the report said.  Trainmaker  CSR Corp. (601766) , gained 7.5 percent to HK$4.72 in Hong
Kong, while its shares in Shanghai gained 3.9 percent to 3.77
yuan in Shanghai.  China Railway Group rose 8.9 percent to HK$3.73 at 1:44
p.m, and China Railway Construction gained 9.7 percent to
HK$6.93 as of 1:44 p.m. local time. The two companies are the
biggest Chinese builders of rail and metro lines.  To contact the reporters on this story:
