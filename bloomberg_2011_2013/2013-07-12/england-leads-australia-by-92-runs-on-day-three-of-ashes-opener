Ian Bell’s unbeaten half-century
helped  England  to a 261-run lead over  Australia  after day three
of the opening Test of the Ashes cricket series.  Bell scored 95 as England reached 326-6 at Trent Bridge in
Nottingham. He and Stuart Broad, who scored 47, were on a 108-run partnership at stumps.  Broad was involved in controversy when he appeared to be
caught by Michael Clarke at slip after edging off the gloves of
wicketkeeper Brad Haddin with England 297-6. The batsman didn’t
walk and umpire Aleem Dar ruled him not out. Since Australia had
used its two review challenges, Broad stayed put.  “Every batsman around the world has the right to wait for
the umpire’s decision,” England’s Kevin Pietersen, who scored
64, said of Broad in an interview with Sky Sports. “Aleem Dar
is one of the best in the world and he was well within his
rights to wait for that decision.”  Captain Alastair Cook and Pietersen helped England reach
157-4 in the day’s opening session after resuming at 80-2. The
duo had a 110-run third-wicket partnership which ended when
Pietersen was dismissed by James Pattinson.  Cook, who made 50, was caught by Clarke from Ashton Agar a
short moment later to leave the hosts at 131-4. It was the first
wicket taken by Agar, a 19-year-old debutant who yesterday
scored 98, the highest total for a No. 11 in Test history.  Agar got his second wicket after lunch when Jonny Bairstow
was caught by Haddin.  Peter Siddle  then dismissed Matt Prior to
leave England at 218-6, setting the stage for Bell and Broad’s
closing partnership.  The Australia players and coach Darren Lehmann were visibly
upset over the non-dismissal of Broad. England would then go on
to add another 29 runs before stumps.  To contact the reporter on this story:
