The Internal Revenue Service is
giving overseas banks a six-month delay to the start of the
Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, the Treasury Department said
in a statement today.  The extension of the act, or FATCA, follows a previous
delay announced in 2011. The extension, to July 1, 2014, will
allow foreign banks time to comply with the law “while helping
ensure efficient implementation,” the Treasury said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
