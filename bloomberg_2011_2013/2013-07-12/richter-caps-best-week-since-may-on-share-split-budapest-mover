Gedeon  Richter Nyrt .,  Hungary ’s
biggest drugmaker, capped the best weekly gain in almost two
months after carrying out a 10-1 split in the stock’s face value
to boost liquidity.  The shares rose 3.3 percent to 3,686 forint by the close in
Budapest, extending the five-day advance to 4.3 percent, the
strongest performance since the week through May 24. Volume
amounted to 155 percent of the three-month average today. The
benchmark BUX stock  gauge  rose 1.7 percent.  Yesterday marked the first day of trading with shares of
100 forint nominal value, after the 1,000 denomination ended
trade the previous day. The higher volumes caused by the lower
face value may help Richter return to  MSCI Inc. (MSCI) ’s basket of
Hungarian equities, analysts at Erste Group Bank AG and Equilor
Befektetesi Zrt. said.  Richter fell to a 6-month low in November before it was
dropped from the index. The shift to the new face value will be
officially completed for accounting purposes on July 16,
according to Richter’s statement to the Budapest Stock Exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
