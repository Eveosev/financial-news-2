Empresas CMPC SA (CMPC) ,  Chile ’s second-largest pulp exporter, rose the most in two months after
Deutsche Bank AG analysts said the shares may gain 23 percent
over the next year as a weaker peso bolsters export revenue.  CMPC gained 2.3 percent to 1,460 pesos as of 1:11 p.m. in
Santiago, the biggest gain on a closing basis since May 4. The
IPSA benchmark index fell 0.3 percent.  Deutsche Bank said Santiago-based CMPC’s stock is
attractive compared with peers after it fell 23 percent from
this year’s high of 1,906.96 pesos on Feb. 15. The shares trade
at about 17 times estimated 2013 earnings, versus 20 times for
 Empresas Copec SA (COPEC) , Chile’s largest pulp exporter, according to
data compiled by Bloomberg.  CMPC “presents considerable long-term upside potential,”
Josh Milberg, a Sao Paulo-based analyst for the bank, wrote in
an e-mailed note. “It looks more attractive to us than Copec
today, taking into account valuation.”  Deutsche Bank has a buy rating on CMPC, with a 12-month
target price of 1,800 pesos.  The company stands to benefit from a weaker local currency
and higher output as new plants begin operations, Milberg wrote.
The bank lowered its estimate for CMPC’s profit this year,
saying hardwood pulp prices have peaked.  To contact the reporter on this story:
