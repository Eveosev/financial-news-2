Cancom AG surged for a second day
after an analyst at Hauck & Aufhaeuser Privatbankiers KGaA said
the German software provider may be a takeover target as it
sells more cloud applications accessed via the Web.  The shares  rose as much as 10 percent  today to 20.31 euros,
the highest intraday price since August 2000, and traded at that
level as of 5:16 p.m. in Frankfurt. That followed a 2.5 percent
advance yesterday and gave the Munich-based company a market
value of 232.3 million euros ($303 million).  “Cancom is an appealing takeover target especially for
companies looking for cloud exposures to German small and
medium-sized enterprises,” such as International Business
Machines Corp. and  Deutsche Telekom AG (DTE) ’s T-Systems unit, Tim
Wunderlich, an analyst at Hauck & Aufhaeuser, said in a note
dated July 10.  Cancoms’s “cloud-related” earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization may rise by 54 percent a
year to 11 million euros by 2015 from 3 million euros in 2012,
according to the note. The company’s cloud systems offer
“significant cost and time savings” compared with rivals such
as Bechtle and Computacenter Plc, Hauck & Aufhaeuser said.  “We have a strong interest to stay independent, and I
think our business performance will allow us to do that,” Beate
Rosenfeld, a spokewoman for Cancom, said today. “Cloud
computing is receiving the attention of the markets. That’s how
we explain our rising share price.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
