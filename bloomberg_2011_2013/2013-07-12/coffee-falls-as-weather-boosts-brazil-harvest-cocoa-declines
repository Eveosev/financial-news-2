Arabica-coffee futures fell the most
in a week on signs that crops being harvested in Brazil, the
world’s largest producer, will avoid frost damage. Cocoa and
sugar also declined, while cotton and orange juice rose.  Temperatures will remain above freezing in Brazil over the
next two weeks, and coffee-growing states of Sao Paulo and
Parana will be mostly dry, said Donald Keeney, a meteorologist
at MDA Information Systems Inc. in Gaithersburg,  Maryland . About
44 percent of the harvest was completed as of July 3, more than
the 40 percent a year earlier, crop researcher Safras & Mercado
said July 10. Prices are down 34 percent in the past year amid a
global surplus, and a plunge in the value of the Brazilian real
is encouraging exports.  “Brazilian weather has no frost threats for the next 10 to
20 days, and harvest progress is moving along nicely, so that
will weigh on prices,” Sterling Smith, a futures trading
specialist at Citigroup Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview. “There is nothing supporting coffee right now.”  Arabica coffee for September delivery fell 2 percent to
$1.209 a pound at 10:24 a.m. on ICE Futures U.S. in New York,
erasing yesterday’s gain of 1.4 percent and heading for the
biggest drop since July 3.  Brazil ’s harvest this year will total 53.7 million bags,
the third-largest ever, expanding domestic stockpiles by 22
percent to 8.23 million bags, the U.S. Department of Agriculture
estimates. A bag weighs 60 kilograms (132 pounds).  Cocoa, Cotton  Cocoa futures for September delivery slid 0.3 percent to
$2,232 a metric ton on ICE, after touching $2,260, the highest
for a most-active contract since June 14.  Raw-sugar futures for October delivery slipped 0.1 percent
at 16.09 cents a pound, after yesterday touching 16.08 cents,
the lowest for a most-active contract since July 1, 2010. The
sweetener is down 17 percent this year, heading for a third
straight decline and the longest slump since 1992.  Cotton futures for December delivery advanced 0.2 percent
to 84.88 cents a pound in New York. Prices were up 13 percent
this year through yesterday.  Orange-juice futures for September delivery rose 2.4
