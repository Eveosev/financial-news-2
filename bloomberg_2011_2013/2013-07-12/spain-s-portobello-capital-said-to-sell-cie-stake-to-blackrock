Portobello Capital, a Spanish
private equity firm, sold its stake in car-parts maker  Cie
Automotive SA (CIE) , according to two people with knowledge of the
matter.  BlackRock Inc. (BLK)  bought the stake, said one of the people,
who asked not to be identified because the buyer hasn’t been
announced. Portobello sold 4.94 million shares, or about a 4.3
percent of Cie, at 5.98 euros apiece, valuing the stake at 29.6
million euros ($38.5 million), according to  data  compiled by
Bloomberg. JB Capital Markets managed the transaction.  Cie  shares  climbed as much as 2.2 percent to 6.06 euros and
gained 0.3 percent at 4:10 p.m. in Madrid, valuing the Bilbao,
northern Spain-based company at 678 million euros.  Portobello invests in companies with enterprise values
between 50 million euros and 500 million euros across industries
in Spain and  Portugal , according to its  website . Juan Luis Ramirez, a founding partner at Portobello responsible for
monitoring the stake in Cie, wasn’t immediately available for
comment when contacted by Bloomberg News today.  A BlackRock spokeswoman in London and Cie spokesman
declined to comment on the transaction.  Cie is expanding into emerging markets including Brazil,
Mexico, Russia and India as auto sales in Europe fall. Last
month,  Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd. (MM) , India’s most acquisitive
manufacturer, said it will buy a 13.5 percent stake in Cie as
the companies merge their component-supply businesses into a
unit with annual sales of $3 billion.  To contact the reporter on this story:
