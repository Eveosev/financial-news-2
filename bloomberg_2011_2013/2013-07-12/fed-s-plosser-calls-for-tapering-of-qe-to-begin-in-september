President Charles Plosser, who has opposed the Fed’s current
round of asset purchases, said the central bank should begin
tapering its $85 billion in monthly bond buying in September and
end the unorthodox stimulus by year-end.  “I don’t want to do it all at once, but I think we should
begin to taper very soon and hopefully end it by the end of this
year,” Plosser said today in an interview in Jackson Hole,
 Wyoming . “That would be a healthy thing for the economy. We can
do it gradually.”  Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said last month the Fed is on
track to begin reducing its bond buying later this year and halt
the program by around mid-2014 if the economy performs in line
with central bank forecasts. Plosser, who doesn’t vote on
monetary policy this year, has repeatedly spoken out against
additional easing by the Fed.  “I’d like for us to start in September” to taper the
purchases, Plosser said in the Bloomberg Television interview
with Michael McKee to air July 15. “We don’t want to create
another housing boom,” and “we have to be careful of the
unintended consequences of our policies.”  The Federal Open Market Committee on June 19 pledged to
continue its current purchase pace for mortgage bonds and
 Treasuries (USGG10YR) , seeking to bolster U.S. growth and reduce
unemployment. Many officials wanted to see gains in the labor
market before reducing the pace of the monthly purchases,
minutes of the June 18-19 gathering showed.  Halt Buying  At the same time, about half of the 19 participants in the
FOMC wanted to halt bond buying by the Fed by year-end, the
minutes said.  Treasuries fell today, erasing earlier gains. The yield on
the 10-year Treasury note increased 1 basis point to 2.58
percent. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index advanced 0.3 percent to
1,680.19.  The risks from the Fed’s so-called quantitative easing are
growing with the size of its balance sheet, currently at $3.5
trillion, Plosser said. It will be “difficult” for the Fed to
change course on policy, he said.  Speaking to reporters after giving a speech today, the Fed
district bank chief said he would be “increasingly
uncomfortable” if inflation continued to drop. He “would be
fine” tapering both Treasuries and mortgage bonds, he said.  Financial Markets  “The most important thing is to begin to unwind” the
asset-purchasing program and “focus” on communicating to
financial markets that the Fed will keep rates low, he said.  In his speech today, Plosser said recent changes in the way
the central bank explains its policy outlook have “likely
caused more confusion than illumination.” Fed officials should
make a clearer pledge to keep interest rates near zero as long
as unemployment is above 6.5 percent and inflation is no more
than 2.5 percent, he said in prepared remarks at the Global
Interdependence Center’s Rocky Mountain Economic Summit.  Instead of emphasizing flexibility, central bankers should
treat the guidance as “triggers rather than thresholds,” he
said. “Effective forward guidance demands commitment.”  Plosser said he foresees the unemployment rate
“approaching” 7 percent by year-end and 6.5 percent before the
end of 2014. The jobless rate was 7.6 percent in June.  The Philadelphia Fed chief in 2011 dissented twice against
FOMC decisions to add monetary stimulus.  To contact the reporter on this story:
