Canola futures dropped to a 17-month
low on signs that warm, wet weather is improving the yield
prospects for the crop in  Canada , the world’s largest grower.  Crop conditions look “very good” across the Canadian
Prairies and yields will be average or above-average in
Saskatchewan, Manitoba and  Alberta , the country’s largest
growers, FarmLink marketing solutions said today in an e-mailed
 report . Processors in Canada used 0.3 percent less canola to
make vegtable oil and animal feed in the week ended July 10, an
industry group said today.  “The crop conditions seem to be improving here with a
little bit better heat in the forecast, some rain floating
across the Prairies,” Jamie Wilton, a commodity futures
specialist with ScotiaMcLeod in Winnipeg, said in an telephone
interview. “The heat is helping advance the crops.”  Canola futures for November settlement fell 1.1 percent to
settle at C$530.80 ($510.53) a ton at 1:28 p.m. on the ICE
Futures Exchange in Winnipeg, after touching C$528.30, the
lowest for the most-active contract since Feb. 6, 2012. Prices
are down 15 percent from a year ago.  The government  estimated  in June that canola production
will rise by 6% for the 2013-2014 crop year due to higher
yields, unchanged from the outlook in May.  Soybeans, which compete with canola among buyers of
vegetable oils and  animal feed , have dropped 18 percent from a
year ago.  To contact the reporter on this story:
