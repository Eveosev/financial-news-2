The Caspian Pipeline Consortium,
operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that has shared
foreign ownership, will cut daily crude exports from the Black
Sea in August by 9.7 percent, a preliminary loading program
obtained by  Bloomberg News  showed.  The group, known as CPC, will ship 2.611 million metric
tons next month, compared with 2.89 million tons in July,
according to the schedule. That’s equal to 654,435 barrels a
day, compared with 724,490 barrels this month, the most since
November 2010.  The program comprises nine cargoes of 134,000 to 135,500
tons each and 16 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons,
according to the document.  The CPC pipeline, in which Chevron Corp. is the biggest
corporate shareholder with a 15 percent stake, carries crude
from  Kazakhstan ’s western fields to a terminal near Russia’s
Novorossiysk port on the  Black Sea . Russia owns 31 percent of
the pipeline and Kazakhstan 21 percent. Exxon Mobil Corp., OAO
Lukoil and a joint venture between OAO Rosneft and Royal Dutch
Shell Plc are among the other shareholders.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
