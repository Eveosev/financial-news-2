WebMD Health Corp. (WBMD) , owner of the
consumer health-information website, rose to its highest value
in 18 months after saying revenue and profit this year will be
higher than previously  forecast .  WebMD increased 25 percent to $33.83 at 10:07 a.m. New York
time after reaching $34.99, its highest intraday price since
Jan. 9, 2012. The stock of the New York-based company had
advanced 88 percent this year through yesterday.  Revenue in 2013 will increase 3 percent to 7 percent to as
much as $505 million, WebMD said today in a statement. The
company in May projected revenue of as much as $470 million. Net
income will be $3 million to $11 million, compared with a
previous forecast of a loss of as much as $13 million.  “Business is improving quicker than we expected, which we
attribute to increasing pharma spending and the company’s new
selling strategy bearing fruit,” Alexander Draper, an analyst
with  Raymond James , wrote in a research note today.  Second-quarter net income was about $3 million, or 5 cents
a share, on revenue of as much as $125 million, WebMD said,
noting the results are preliminary. Analysts had  estimated 
second-quarter sales of $118.8 million, the average of five
projections compiled by Bloomberg.  WebMD plans to report full second-quarter results on July
31.  WebMD’s chief executive officer, Cavan Redmond, stepped
down in May after about a year on the job as the company worked
to broaden its business and draw more revenue. The company said
in December it would fire 250 workers, about 14 percent of its
workforce, citing a decline in drug ads. David J. Schlanger is
acting as interim CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
