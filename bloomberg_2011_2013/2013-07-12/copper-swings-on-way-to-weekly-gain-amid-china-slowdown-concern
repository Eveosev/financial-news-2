Copper swung between gains and loses
on its way to a weekly advance amid concern that slowing
economic growth in  China  will hurt demand for metals. Aluminum,
zinc and lead declined, while tin and nickel rose.  Metal for delivery in three months rose as much as 0.5
percent and fell as much as 0.3 percent before trading unchanged
at $7,000 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange at 11:24
a.m. in  Seoul . The price is still up 3.1 percent this week, the
best run since the five days ended May 3. The contract for
delivery in November slipped 0.5 percent to 50,470  yuan  a ton
($8,223) on the Shanghai Futures Exchange.  Two gauges of China’s manufacturing fell last month and
factory-gate prices for June marked the worst run of declines
since 2002, data showed this month, underscoring a sustained
slowdown in the world’s top metals user. Chinese Premier  Li
Keqiang  said policy should ensure economic activity moves within
a reasonable range, according to a Xinhua News Agency report.  “Macro indicators out of China have been weak so far,”
said Chae Un Soo, a metals trader at Seoul-based Korea Exchange
Bank Futures Co. “The comment by Li Keqiang does not seem to
have assured the market that he will surely do something to
boost growth.”  Futures for delivery in September fell 0.1 percent to
$3.1745 a pound on the Comex in  New York .  To contact the reporter on this story:
