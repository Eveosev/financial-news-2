A collection of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti Burgundy valued at as much as HK$16 million ($2.1 million) will go on sale at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in  Hong Kong  in September, including wines from its La Tache and Montrachet vineyards.  Top lots will include a six-liter Methuselah of Romanee-Conti 1989 DRC with an upper estimate of HK$800,000 and six bottles from its 1993 vintage priced to fetch as much as HK$500,000, according to a Sotheby’s statement.  The auction comes after the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index of top Bordeaux vintages has risen 4 percent this year, with declines since mid-March following a gain of 8 percent in the first 10 weeks of the year.  Broadly stable prices during the past month point to “resilience in the fine wine market,”  Chris Smith , investment manager at The Wine Investment Fund in  London , wrote in his market report. The fund manages $50 million.  Other leading wines in the Sotheby’s sale include a Methuselah of La Tache 1991 with a top estimate of HK$200,000 and a similar-sized bottle of Montrachet for as much as HK$300,000, Sotheby’s said.
