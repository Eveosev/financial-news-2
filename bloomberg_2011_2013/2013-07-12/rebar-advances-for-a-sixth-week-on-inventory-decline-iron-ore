Steel reinforcement-bar futures in
 Shanghai  rose today, capping a sixth weekly gain as inventories
declined and  iron ore  prices advanced.  Rebar for delivery in January on the Shanghai Futures
Exchange rose by 0.3 percent to close at 3,656 yuan ($596) a
metric ton. Futures have advanced 1 percent this week.  Rebar inventory tracked by Shanghai’s Steelhome Information
Technology Co. fell 2.5 percent last week after slumping 26
percent last quarter.  Iron ore  for immediate delivery at Tianjin
port rose 1.1 percent to $125.20 a dry ton yesterday, the
highest since May 15, according to The Steel Index Ltd.  “There are signs that higher raw material costs and lower
inventory spurred more purchasing,” said Xiao Long, an analyst
at Zhaojin Futures Co. in Zibo.  Expectations for more demand for the building material in
the second half of this year also supported the market, Xiao
said. China may continue its development of railroad
construction to absorb some overcapacity in steel and cement
industries, the 21st Century Business Herald reported today,
citing unidentified people close to the China Railway Corp.  The average spot price for rebar in China fell 0.2 percent
to 3,401  yuan  a ton yesterday, according to data from Beijing
Antaike Information Development Co.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
