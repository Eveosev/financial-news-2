The Quebec government will review
increasing rail car inspections and could move tracks from
downtown Lac-Megantic, according to Sylvain Gaudreault, the
provinceâ€™s transportation minister.  A runaway train carrying crude oil derailed and exploded in
the small town on July 6, killing 24 people with 26 still
missing.  Gaudreault spoke at a press conference in Lac-Megantic.  To contact the reporter on this story:
