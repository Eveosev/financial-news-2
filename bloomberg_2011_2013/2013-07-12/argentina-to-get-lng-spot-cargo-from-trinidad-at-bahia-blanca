Argentina, which has no long-term
contracts to import liquefied natural gas, is scheduled to
receive a spot cargo today from  Trinidad & Tobago , ship-tracking
data show.  The Celestine River, with a capacity of about 145,000 cubic
meters, will arrive at  Bahia Blanca  southwest of  Buenos Aires ,
according to transmissions captured by IHS Fairplay on
Bloomberg. The vessel docked at Atlantic LNG Co.â€™s Point Fortin
terminal to load the supercooled gas and departed June 29.  Argentina imports LNG through YPF SA, its largest energy
company, and state-run Energia Argentina SA, known as Enarsa.
YPF closed a tender on May 6 to buy seven LNG cargoes for
delivery to Bahia Blanca. Enarsa and YPF have issued seven spot
tenders seeking as many as 150 shipments since December.  To contact the reporter on this story:
