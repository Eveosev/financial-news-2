German stocks  advanced for a fifth
day, pushing the benchmark  DAX Index (DAX)  toward its biggest weekly
rally since November, amid optimism that central banks from the
U.S. to Japan will continue to support economic recovery.  RWE AG (RWE)  led gains after a report that it is in talks to sell
its Dea oil-and-gas unit.  SAP AG (SAP)  added 0.9 percent after Infosys
Ltd., the Indian software company, forecast full-year sales in
dollar terms that beat analyst estimates.  The DAX Index rose 0.5 percent to 8,197.85 at 9:43 a.m. in
Frankfurt, extending its advance this week to 5 percent. The
gauge has climbed 6.6 percent from a low on June 24. The broader
HDAX Index added 0.5 percent today.  “The U.S. closed at record highs and that is driving
German stocks,” Soeren Steinert, who helps manage about $24
billion as associate director for equities trading at Quoniam
Asset Management GmbH in Frankfurt, wrote in an e-mail. “More
and longer stimulus means a support for global economies and
more cheap money. This money needs to be invested.”  The U.S. Federal Reserve and the  Bank of Japan  both
indicated this week they will continue with their accommodative
policies, after the  European Central Bank  and Bank of England
signaled they will keep key rates low.  The volume of shares changing hands in companies listed on
the DAX was 20 percent lower than the average of the past 30
days, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
