Vietnam’s GDP growth this year
projected to reach 5.3%, compared with 5.2% in 2012,  World Bank 
says in report released today in Hanoi.
* Vietnam economic growth in 2014 seen at 5.4%
* Vietnam 2013 inflation seen at 8.2%, 2014 inflation at 7.9%
* Vietnam 2013 fiscal deficit seen at 4% of GDP, current-account
surplus at 5.6% of GDP
* Vietnam’s macroeconomic conditions are improving, report says,
citing moderate inflation, stable exchange rate, increased
reserves, reduced country risks
* Vietnam decision to adjust exchange rate rather than continue
to defend currency was a “welcome move”
* Foreign reserves have increased to 2.8 months of imports at
end of 1Q from 1.6 months in 2011
* Plan to delay requiring banks to use stricter standards for
bad debt gives banks room to “flexibly interpret the loan
classification system and to underreport NPLs”
*  Vietnam  “government’s approach to restructuring its banking
sector is considerably different from what is generally
considered as good practice,” report says, citing lack of
systemic effort to audit key financial institutions, decision
not to use taxpayer money
*While financial sector is fragile, risk of systemic crisis has
receded
*Inflation has stabilized; price gain expectations have not,
with core inflation averaging about 10% and administrative price
hikes likely to continue in future
*Progress in reforming state-owned enterprises largely limited
to preparation of regulations, many of which have yet to be
approved, and to development of restructuring plans by SOEs  To contact the reporter on this story:
