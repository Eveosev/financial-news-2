Daimler AG (DAI) ’s Mercedes-Benz probably
won’t win the U.S. luxury car sales race this year, Chief
Executive Officer  Dieter Zetsche  said.  “I don’t think we’ll be No. 1 at the end of the year and
that’s OK,” Zetsche told reporters yesterday in Seguin,
Ontario. “We won’t play any games. I’m not sure that applies to
our competition.”  Mercedes led  Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW) ’s BMW in U.S.
deliveries by 1,519 vehicles after the first six months. BMW
captured the crown the past two years and secured the No. 1 spot
in 2012 with a December surge, based on reported sales. Measured
by vehicle registrations, Mercedes topped BMW for the year,
according to researcher R.L. Polk & Co.  Zetsche, 60, wants Mercedes to surpass BMW and  Volkswagen
AG (VOW) ’s Audi in worldwide sales and profit by 2020. In the first
quarter, Mercedes’s operating profit was 3.3 percent of sales,
compared with 11.1 percent for Audi and 9.9 percent for BMW. The
CEO was in Canada for the North American introduction of the
revamped S-Class sedan.  U.S. sales for Mercedes for the year through June gained 10
percent to 141,950, Stuttgart, Germany-based Daimler said July
2. BMW said its deliveries for the period rose 11 percent to
140,431. The figures don’t include Daimler’s cargo vans and
Smart cars and BMW’s Mini brand, which aren’t  luxury vehicles .  To contact the reporter on this story:
