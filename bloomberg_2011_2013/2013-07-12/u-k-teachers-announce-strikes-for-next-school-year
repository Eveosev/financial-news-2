The U.K.’s two largest teaching
unions, which represent 90 percent of teachers in  England  and
 Wales , announced a series of strikes for the school term
starting in September over curbs on pay and pensions.  There will be work stoppages in northern and central
England in the week beginning Sept. 30 and similar action in
 London , the south of England and Wales in the week that starts
Oct. 14, the  National Union of Teachers  and  National Association
of Schoolmasters/Union of Women Teachers  said in a joint e-mailed statement today. There will also be a national one-day
strike during the autumn term.  “Teachers are angry at the government’s continual
undermining of their pay, pensions and working conditions,” NUT
General Secretary Christine Blower said. “If we do not take a
stand now to defend the profession, then the consequences for
teacher recruitment and education will be disastrous for all.”  The unions say Education Secretary Michael Gove hasn’t
“genuinely” engaged in negotiations with them. With the
government pursuing a program of spending cuts to narrow the
 budget deficit , increases in most public-sector workers’ pay is
capped at an annual 1 percent, while staff are also having to
pay higher pension contributions.  To contact the reporter on this story:
