Wrigley Field will move into the
modern era of Major League Baseball stadiums with the addition
of a giant video board and oversized advertising sign rising
above the outfield walls of the 99-year-old ballpark, the
 Chicago Tribune  reported.  The Landmarks Commission yesterday gave unanimous approval
for the structures, key ingredients in the team’s $500 million
renovation plan for Wrigley Field and redevelopment of the
neighborhood with a hotel and office-retail complex, the Tribune
said.  The 5,700-square-foot screen will top the rear wall of left
field. With the addition of a horizontal script sign, the video
screen will be 60 feet tall and 95 feet wide, the Tribune said.  Team owner Tom Ricketts and Mayor Rahm Emanuel want the
deal sealed by the end of July so construction can start after
the regular season ends, the Tribune said.  Wrigley Field, built in 1914 on the grounds of a seminary,
is the second-oldest ballpark in the major leagues behind
 Boston ’s Fenway Park, which was constructed in 1912.  Built as Weeghman Park, the stadium hosted its first
National League game on April 20, 1916, when the Cubs beat the
Cincinnati Reds 7-6 in 11 innings. It was renamed Wrigley Field
in 1926 in honor of the club’s owner, William Wrigley Jr.  Babe Ruth  Wrigley was the site of  Babe Ruth ’s “called shot,” when
he pointed to a spot in the bleachers during Game 3 of the 1932
 World Series  before hitting a home run off Charlie Root.  On May 2, 1917, Cubs pitcher Jim Vaughn and Fred Toney of
the Reds threw no-hitters through nine innings. Toney went into
the record book when Cincinnati’s Jim Thorpe drove in a run in
the 10th inning.  The Cubs were limited to day games until Aug. 8, 1988, when
newly installed lights were turned on for a game against
Philadelphia.  To contact the reporter on this story:
