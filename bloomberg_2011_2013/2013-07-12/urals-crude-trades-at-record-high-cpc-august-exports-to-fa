A cargo of Russian Urals crude sold
in the Mediterranean at a record premium of more than $1 a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to three traders who
participate in the market who asked not to be identified as the
information is confidential.  The Caspian Pipeline Consortium, operator of the only oil-export link in  Russia  that has shared foreign ownership, will
cut daily crude exports from the  Black Sea  in August by 9.7
percent, a preliminary loading program obtained by  Bloomberg
News  showed.  Iraq  resumed flows through its export pipeline to
 Turkey .  North Sea  Trafigura sought Forties for loading Aug. 6 to Aug. 8 at 40
cents a barrel above Dated Brent, without finding a seller,  a
Bloomberg survey of traders and brokers monitoring the Platts
pricing window showed.  Mercuria failed to buy Forties for loading July 25 to July
31, despite bidding at a premium of 60 cents a barrel to Dated
Brent, the highest since January 31.  There were no bids or offers for Brent, Oseberg or Ekofisk.
Reported crude trading typically occurs during the Platts
window, which ends at 4:30 p.m. London time. Forties loading in
10 to 25 days stood at a premium of 47 cents to Dated Brent,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  Brent for August settlement traded at $108.52 a barrel on
the ICE Futures Europe exchange at the close of the window,
compared with $107.93 in the previous session. The September
contract was at $107.74 at the same time today, a discount of 78
cents to August.  Mediterranean/Urals  A Urals crude cargo of 80,000 metric tons for loading July
26 to 27 at Novorossiysk in the Black Sea sold at more than $1 a
barrel to Dated Brent, according to three traders. That is the
highest level since at least July 1991, when Bloomberg started
tracking the data.  Eni SpA (ENI)  was looking to sell 100,000 metric tons of Urals
for loading Aug. 1 to Aug. 5 at 55 cents a barrel more than
Dated Brent on a delivered basis to Rotterdam, then withdrew its
offer, according to the survey.  Urals in the Mediterranean held steady at a premium of 77
cents a barrel to Dated Brent.  Crude flows from Iraq through the Kirkuk-Ceyhan pipeline
have resumed, according to a statement from the North Oil Co.
Test pumping resumed at 2 p.m. Baghdad time at an average of
250,000 barrels a day and is expected to reach 350,000 barrels a
day by midnight, the company said. Pumping was stopped yesterday
night.  The CPC will ship 2.611 million metric tons next month,
compared with 2.89 million tons in July, according to the
schedule. That’s equal to 654,435 barrels a day, compared with
724,490 barrels this month, the most since November 2010.  The loading program comprises nine cargoes of 134,000 to
135,500 tons each and 16 consignments of 85,000 to 93,500 tons,
according to the document.  West Africa  Nigerian benchmark Qua Iboe was priced at $2.50 a barrel
more than Dated Brent, data compiled by Bloomberg showed.  Total didn’t manage to sell a shipment of Cabinda for Aug.
2 to Aug. 3 loading at $1.1 a barrel less than Dated Brent, the
survey showed. The company started offering the cargo on June 28
at a premium of 30 cents.  Six to eight cargoes of Angolan crude for loading in August
are said to be unsold, according to two traders who participate
in the market and asked not to be identified because the
information is confidential. Most unsold cargoes are said to be
Nemba and Cabinda grades as regular Asian buyers, especially
Taiwanese and Indian refineries, have cut purchases recently,
the traders said.  To contact the reporters on this story:
