Brazil’s government plans to change
rules on concessions and allow the country’s three biggest
pension funds to invest in more than one airport, a member of
President Dilma Rousseff’s economic team said.  The funds, known as Previ, Petros and Funcef, own 25
percent each of Investimentos e Participacoes em Infra-Estrutura, known as Invepar, the company responsible for
operating Guarulhos airport, in  Sao Paulo . The three funds
control combined assets of 266 billion reais ($117 billion).  Brazil is preparing to auction in September concessions for
Tom Jobim airport in Rio de Janeiro and Confins in  Minas Gerais ,
according to the National Agency for Civil Aviation.  The government also plans to relax the requirement that
bidders must have experience operating one airport with at least
35 million passengers per year. The change would allow bids by a
consortium whose partners handle airports whose combined
passenger traffic totals 35 million, said the official, who
asked to not be named because the changes are still being
discussed.  The change would allow Flughafen Munchen GmbH, or FMG, to
bid in the next round of airport concessions. Brazil would like
to have two German companies bidding -  Fraport AG Frankfurt
Airport Services Worldwide (FRA) , operator of Frankfurt airport, and
Munich airport operator FMG, said the official.  To contact the reporters on this story:
