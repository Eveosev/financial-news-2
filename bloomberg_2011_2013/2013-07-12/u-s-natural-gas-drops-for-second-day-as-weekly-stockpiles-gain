Natural gas futures declined for a
second day in  New York  as a sixth week of above-average
inventory increases in the U.S. signaled ample supplies of the
power-plant fuel.  Gas for August delivery fell as much as 0.4 percent to
$3.60 per million British thermal units in electronic trading on
the  New York Mercantile Exchange  and was at $3.606 at 11:53 a.m.
Singapore time. The contract dropped 1.8 percent to $3.613
yesterday, the lowest settlement price since July 1.  U.S. stockpiles rose 82 billion cubic feet in the week
ended July 5 to 2.687 trillion, according to data from the
Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department’s
statistical unit. This matched the median estimate in a
Bloomberg News survey of analysts. Supply increases have topped
five-year averages as moderate weather reduced demand.  “It can go without saying that an 82 billion cubic feet
increase is a solid number for early July, especially given last
week’s heat wave in the West,”  Stephen Schork , the president of
Schork Group Inc., a consultant in Villanova,  Pennsylvania , said
in an e-mailed report today. “Current storage is ahead of the
curve.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
