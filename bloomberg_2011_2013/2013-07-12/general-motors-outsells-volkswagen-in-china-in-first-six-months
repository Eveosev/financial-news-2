General Motors Co. (GM)  outsold
 Volkswagen AG (VOW)  in China in the first half, helped by an increase
in demand for Buick and Cadillac vehicles.  Volkswagen, which unlike GM includes  Hong Kong  and Macau in
its China figures, today reported first-half sales in China rose
19 percent to 1.54 million vehicles. That compares with the 1.57
million deliveries reported by GM.  The result keeps GM on track to maintain its annual sales
lead among foreign automakers in China for a ninth straight
year. Both companies count the country as their largest market
and have forecast sales of about three million vehicles each
this year. They are locked in a race with  Toyota Motor Corp. (7203)  to
be the world’s biggest automaker.  Volkswagen, whose stable of brands include its namesake
marque and the premium Audi nameplate, joined GM in outpacing
the 14 percent gain in total Chinese passenger-vehicle sales in
the January-to-June period.  “We plan to keep adding new and refreshed models this year
to maintain growth momentum and meet rising demand in China,”
Bob Socia, president of GM China, said in a statement.  Both automakers have announced more investments in China to
expand production. GM, which broke ground on a Cadillac assembly
plant in  Shanghai  last month, will spend $11 billion in China by
2016 on new plants and products, while Volkswagen plans to spend
9.8 billion euros ($12.8 billion) by 2015.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
