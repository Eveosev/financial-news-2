National Australia Bank Ltd. (NAB) , the
country’s largest lender by assets, said it signed an agreement
with China’s largest agricultural group to boost lending
capabilities in the world’s second biggest economy.  The memorandum of understanding gives China National
Agricultural Development Group access to NAB lending services
including acquisition funding and trade finance, the Melbourne-based lender said in a statement today.  The pact is NAB’s fifth cross-border financial services
tie-up in China and second this year, following an arrangement
with China Development Bank Corp. in February, NAB said. The
countries are bolstering agricultural ties as the mining boom
that  Australia  depended on for growth wanes and Chinese
companies try to meet rising demand for food.  “The agreement enhances the bank’s relationship with
strategic partners in  China  and is an important milestone in
supporting the bilateral trade and economic relationships
between the two regions,” Joseph Healy, NAB’s head of business
banking, said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
