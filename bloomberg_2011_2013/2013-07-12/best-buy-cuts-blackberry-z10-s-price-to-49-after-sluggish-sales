Best Buy Co. (BBY)  has cut the price of
BlackBerry Ltd.’s Z10 smartphone to $49.99 with a service
contract, two weeks after the Canadian smartphone maker reported
lackluster sales of the flagship touch-screen model.  The Z10 is available at that price with a two-year contract
from Verizon Wireless or  AT&T Inc. (T) , the Richfield, Minnesota-based retailer said on its website. The device originally went
on sale in the U.S. in March at $199.99, on par with  Apple
Inc. (AAPL) ’s iPhone.  Sales of the Z10 last quarter were almost 1 million units
short of analysts’ estimates, contributing to a surprise loss
for BlackBerry. The company is now increasingly dependent on the
newer Q10 phone, which features a physical keyboard and appeals
to its existing customer base. BlackBerry, which has steadily
lost market share to Apple and other rivals, accounted for less
than 3 percent of global smartphone sales last quarter,
according to research firm IDC.  BlackBerry shares fell 1 percent to $9.24 at the close in
New York. The stock has dropped 22 percent this year.  The Best Buy price cut was reported earlier by the Wall
Street Journal.  To contact the reporter on this story:
