Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)  filed a lawsuit
today accusing  U.S. Customs  officials of refusing to follow a
trade agency’s order to block imports of phones made by  Google
Inc. (GOOG) ’s Motorola Mobility unit.  The U.S. International Trade Commission in Washington
issued the import ban in May 2012 after deciding that Motorola
Mobility devices infringed a Microsoft patent for a way mobile
phones synchronize calendar events with other computers.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection, after having secret
meetings with Google, continued to let the Motorola Mobility
mobile phones enter the country even though Google has done
nothing to remove the feature at the heart of the ITC case,
Microsoft said in the complaint. The case illustrates what
Lexmark International Inc. and Lutron Electronics Co. in May
called an “increasingly ineffective and unpredictable
enforcement” of import bans imposed by the trade agency.  “Customs has a clear responsibility to carry out ITC
decisions, which are reached after a full trial and rigorous
legal review,” Microsoft Deputy General Counsel  David Howard 
said in a statement. “Here Customs repeatedly ignored its
obligation and did so based on secret discussions.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
