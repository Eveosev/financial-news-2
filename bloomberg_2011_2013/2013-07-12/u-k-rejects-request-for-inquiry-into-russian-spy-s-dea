The U.K. rejected a request for a
public inquiry into the death of former Russian spy  Alexander Litvinenko , the coroner responsible for his inquest said.  Judge Robert Owen told a hearing in central London today
that his request to Justice Secretary Chris Grayling for a probe
had been turned down, his office said in an e-mailed statement.  Owen wrote to Grayling on June 4 asking him to order an
inquiry into the circumstances surrounding the death of
Litvinenko, a critic of the Kremlin who lived in London and died
about three weeks after being exposed to radioactive polonium
hidden in a pot of tea.  British prosecutors said in 2007 that another former
Russian intelligence officer,  Andrei Lugovoi , should be charged
with murder. There is evidence indicating the Russian government
was also involved, lawyers working on the inquest said in
December. Russia has refused requests for Lugovoi’s extradition.  “We believe that the coroner’s inquest can continue to
effectively investigate the circumstance of Mr. Litivenko’s
death and we will continue to cooperate fully with it,” the
U.K. Home Office said in an e-mailed statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
