The Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority, the non-governmental regulator of brokerages, is
moving to disclose trade information on additional types of
securitized debt.  Finra’s board has authorized its staff to seek approval
from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for the update
to data released through its Trade Reporting and Compliance
Engine, or Trace, according to a  posting  yesterday on its
website. The proposal will cover bonds backed by assets
including car loans and student borrowing, Finra said. It won’t
extend to home-loan bonds known as collateralized mortgage
obligations.  Finra has been expanding Trace to securitized debt after
the opacity of trading in securities including  home-loan bonds 
without government backing contributed to the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression in 2008.  The regulator, which operates from  Washington  and New York,
has already started releasing trade-by-trade information on
government-backed mortgage securities and  aggregated data  on a
broader range of securitized debt.  The Trace system started in 2002, providing the first real-time data on most corporate bond trading to anyone with Internet
access.  To contact the reporter on this story:
