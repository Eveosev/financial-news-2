Palm oil  slumped the most in more
than four months after the U.S. government increased estimates
for the country’s soybean output and stockpiles before the next
harvest, boosting the outlook for global oilseed supplies.  The contract for September delivery retreated as much as
2.7 percent to 2,307 ringgit ($727) a metric ton on the Bursa
Malaysia Derivatives, the steepest drop for most-active futures
since Feb. 25, and was at 2,316 ringgit at 5:38 p.m. in Kuala
Lumpur. Prices are down 3 percent this week. Palm for local
physical delivery in July was at 2,370 ringgit, data compiled by
Bloomberg show.  Soybean reserves in the U.S., the biggest shipper, will
total 295 million bushels (8 million tons) on Aug. 31, 2014, the
Department of Agriculture said in a report yesterday. That’s 11
percent more than the 265 million bushels forecast in June.
Output will jump to an all-time high of 3.42 billion bushels,
more than the 3.39 billion estimated last month, the USDA said.  “The USDA numbers were bearish,” said Paramalingam Supramaniam, director at brokerage Pelindung Bestari Sdn. in
Selangor. “This will pressure palm oil because of the
anticipation of higher global cooking oil supplies.”  Palm oil’s  discount  to  soybean oil  shrank to $253.44 a ton
on June 27, the smallest since August, and was at $277.93 today.
The two edible oils are substitutes in food and fuel uses.  Soybean oil for delivery in December was little changed at
45.71 cents a pound on the Chicago Board of Trade, while
soybeans for delivery in November declined 0.3 percent to $12.87
a bushel. Refined palm oil for January delivery fell 1.9 percent
to close at 5,818  yuan  ($948) a ton on the  Dalian Commodity
Exchange , while soybean oil for delivery in the same month
dropped 1 percent to end at 7,282 yuan.  To contact the reporter on this story:
