AquaSure Pty Ltd., the builder of
 Australia ’s largest desalination plant, is seeking to refinance
about A$3.6 billion ($3.26 billion) of loan facilities backing
the project, according to three people familiar with the matter.  The group is seeking to diversify funding and asked banks
to submit proposals for the financing, the people said.
Borrowing costs for the Victorian desalination project to
convert seawater to drinking water, which finished construction
in late 2012, are expected to fall materially from the original
greenfield financing signed in 2009, the people said.  Information came from people familiar with the matter who
asked not to be identified because such details on the reverse-osmosis project in Wonthaggi near  Melbourne  are private.  AquaSure Finance has a A$3.67 billion  term loan  maturing in
September 2016 that pays 350 basis points more than the bank
bill swap rate, according to data compiled by Bloomberg that
shows the loan has a refinancing option available after five
years. John Ridley, a Melbourne-based spokesman for the company,
didn’t answer calls to his mobile phone or immediately reply to
a text message seeking comment on the refinancing.  To contact the reporter on this story:
