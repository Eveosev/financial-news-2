Oupa Magashula, the head of the
South African Revenue Service, quit after a panel found that he
sought to stymie its investigations into whether he breached
hiring procedures.  Finance Minister  Pravin Gordhan  on March 24 appointed the
two-member panel to probe Magashula’s conduct after
Johannesburg-based City Press reported he had offered a job to
an associate of a convicted drug dealer. The report was based on
a taped phone conversation.  Magashula had failed to co-operate adequately with the
investigators and provided false testimony, Gordhan said. His
conduct “placed the reputation and credibility of SARS at
risk,” the minister said. The panel though had found no
evidence that Magashula committed a crime, Gordhan said.  Ivan Pillay, the deputy commissioner of SARS, was appointed
to replace Magashula in an acting capacity.  To contact the reporters on this story:
