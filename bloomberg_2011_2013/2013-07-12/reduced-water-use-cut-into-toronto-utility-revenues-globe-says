Torontoâ€™s efforts to curb water use
with low-flush toilets, more efficient washing machines and
other conservation devices has cut consumption by 10 percent
since 2005, leaving an estimated C$350 million ($337 million)
loss in revenue from water utility bills over the coming decade,
the Globe and Mail reported.  The paper, citing a city report and officials, said the
cash shortfall expected in the coming decade occurs at a time of
 climate change  and more damaging storms including a flood this
week that caused an estimated C$600 million in damage. It also
follows a decision by the city council last year to cut C$1.1
billion from such projects as storm-water management and raises
vexing questions about how the city will find new funding for
wastewater infrastructure upgrades, the paper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
