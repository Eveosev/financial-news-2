The cost of insuring corporate and
sovereign bonds against non-payment in  Asia  outside  Japan  fell,
according to credit-default swap traders.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 40 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan dropped 3 basis points to 146 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Singapore , Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc prices show. The measure is poised to fall 9.6 basis
points this week and close at its lowest level since June 19,
according to data provider CMA.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index was little changed at 128
basis points as of 10:22 a.m. in Sydney, Westpac Banking Corp.
prices show. The benchmark is also set for its lowest close
since June 19, according to CMA, which is owned by McGraw-Hill
Cos. and compiles prices quoted by dealers in the private
market.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index was little changed at 94
basis points as of 9:57 a.m. in Tokyo, according to Citigroup
Inc. prices. The gauge is on track for its lowest level since
June 10, CMA data show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for insuring
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements.  To contact the reporter on this story:
