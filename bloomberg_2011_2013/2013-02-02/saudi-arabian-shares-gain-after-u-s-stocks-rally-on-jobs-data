Saudi Arabia’s benchmark stock index
rose to the highest in almost three weeks, led by banks and
petrochemicals, after U.S. stocks rallied for a fifth week on an
improving labor market and better-than-estimated earnings.  Yanbu National Petrochemicals Co. (YANSAB)  climbed to the highest
nine months, while Alinma Bank gained the most in two weeks.  Dar
Al Arkan Real Estate Development Co. (ALARKAN)  increased to an almost
four-week high.  The Tadawul All Share Index gained 0.2 percent to 7,057.59
by the 3:30 p.m close in Riyadh, the highest since Jan. 14,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Saudi Arabia’s stock
exchange is the only Persian Gulf bourse that trades on
Saturdays.  “The Saudi stock exchange benefited a lot from global
markets reacting to the developments in the  U.S. economy ,”
Fadhel Albuainain, a Jubail-based banking economist, said by
phone.  The U.S. rally sent the  Dow Jones Industrial Average  above
14,000 for the first time in five years, as data on the labor
market and manufacturing boosted confidence in the world’s
biggest economy. Of the 254 S&P 500 companies that have posted
results, 73 percent exceeded analysts’ profit estimates and 65
percent topped sales projections, data compiled by Bloomberg
show.  Yanbu National Petrochemicals rose 1.4 percent to 52.75
riyals while  Alinma Bank (ALINMA)  increased 1.1 percent to 13.65 riyals.
Dar Al Arkan Real Estate gained 1.1 percent to 8.95 riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
