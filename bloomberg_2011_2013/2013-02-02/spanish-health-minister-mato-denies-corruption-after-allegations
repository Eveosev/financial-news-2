Spanish Health Minister Ana Mato
reiterated her “absolute innocence” regarding reports in the
Spanish press today that she was a beneficiary of holidays, cash
payments and gifts from businessmen who are being investigated
for bribing officials.  “I want to reiterate my absolute innocence regarding the
confabulations that some media organizations have unloaded upon
me,” Mato said in an e-mailed press statement.  The statement came after  El Mundo  newspaper reported today
that between 2002 and 2003 a shell company provided air tickets,
hotel rooms, chauffeur services and expensive gifts, and paid
for the holy communion party of the daughter of Mato and her
then husband Jesus Sepulveda, whom she has since divorced.  “This matter regards an investigation into another person
who has already issued a statement expressing that he is the
only person responsible for his actions,” she added, referring
to declarations made by her ex-husband who is currently under
investigation.  El Mundo cited documents sent to  Spain ’s National Court.  To contact the reporter on this story:
