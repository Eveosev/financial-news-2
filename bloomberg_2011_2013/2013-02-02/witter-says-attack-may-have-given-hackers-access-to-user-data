Twitter Inc., the microblogging
service, said it was subjected to unauthorized attempts to hack
into its systems and that attackers may have obtained access to
information for about 250,000 users.  While San Francisco-based Twitter didn’t identify the
source of the attack, it called the perpetrators “extremely
sophisticated,” adding yesterday that “we believe other
companies and organizations have also been recently similarly
attacked.”  The  New York Times Co. (NYT)  reported on Jan. 30 that its
computer network was  attacked  repeatedly by Chinese hackers. The
Wall Street Journal also  detailed  similar attacks on its
systems, while Bloomberg LP, the parent of  Bloomberg News , said
there have been unsuccessful attempts to infiltrate its network.  “This week, we detected unusual access patterns that led
to us identifying unauthorized access attempts to Twitter user
data,” Twitter said in a blog  posting  yesterday. “We
discovered one live attack and were able to shut it down in
process moments later.”  The company said it reset passwords for affected accounts,
and it is getting in touch via e-mail with those with accounts
that were breached.  Twitter was the target of a so-called denial-of-service
attack in 2009, along with  Facebook Inc. (FB)  and LiveJournal Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
