Phil Mickelson  fired a 6-under 65 to
take a four-stroke lead over  Bill Haas  going into the third
round at the Phoenix Open, after missing a chance to break U.S.
Tour’s 36-hole scoring record.  Mickelson ended 36 holes at 17-under 125 while Haas had a
7-under 64 to finish 13-under 129 yesterday at TPC Scottsdale in
Scottsdale,  Arizona .  Mickelson carded a double bogey on the 18th hole yesterday
to finish one stroke off the tour record. The previous day he
was on course to become the sixth golfer to complete a round of
59 in an official U.S. PGA Tour event when a 25-foot birdie putt
on his final hole caught the lip of the cup and spun out.  “You always remember kind of the last hole, the last putt,
but I think it’s very possible that’s going to help me because
it’s got me refocused, that I cannot ease up on a single shot,”
Mickelson told reporters. “These guys are going to make a lot
of birdies and I’ve got to get after it and cannot make those
kinds of mistakes.”  The tour record for the first two rounds of a tournament
was set by Pat Perez in the 2009 Bob Hope Classic, and matched
by  David Toms  at the Colonial two years later.  “Unfortunately, I made a double on the last hole and
didn’t finish the way I wanted to,” Mickelson said.  Keegan Bradley and Brandt Snedeker are 12-under 130, while
Charlie Wi,  Angel Cabrera  and Brian Gay are another stroke back.  Defending champion Kyle Stanley shot a 71 to make the cut
by a stroke at 4-under 138.  To contact the reporter on this story:
