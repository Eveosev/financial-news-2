Punxsutawney Phil emerged from his
burrow this morning in central Pennsylvania and didn’t see his
shadow, which according to legend signals an early spring for
the U.S.  Temperatures hovered at 8 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 13
Celsius) under overcast skies as the groundhog’s handlers
removed him from his stump-shaped shelter in Punxsutawney, a
town about 80 miles (128 kilometers) northeast of Pittsburgh.  A  crowd  of thousands gathered to celebrate the 127th annual
staging of the weather  tradition , according to the  Groundhog
Club , which conducts the annual event atop Gobbler’s Knob.
Organizers had predicted a crowd of about 20,000 because the
event is on a weekend, the  Associated Press  reported.  Central Pennsylvania’s earliest European settlers were
Germans who said that if a hibernating animal casts a shadow on
Feb. 2, the Christian holiday of Candlemas, unpleasant weather
was on its way, according to the club web site.  Punxsutawney Phil and his predecessors have seen their
shadows 100 times since 1887, according to the Groundhog Club.
Only 17 times has the groundhog not seen his shadow, including
two years ago, while another nine results weren’t recorded, the
club said.  If he sees his shadow, there’ll be six more weeks of winter
weather.  The U.S.  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
seems to agree with Phil.  It forecasts either average or above-average temperatures
for the U.S. for February, March and April, with the exception
of the Pacific Northwest and northern Plains.  To contact the reporters on this story:
