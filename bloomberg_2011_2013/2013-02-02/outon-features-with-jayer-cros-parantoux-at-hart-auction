Twenty-seven cases of Chateau Mouton-
Rothschild 1995 go on sale at a Hart Davis Hart Wine Co. auction
in  Chicago  today, along with Chateau Lafite-Rothschild, Chateau
Latour and Chateau Margaux from the same Bordeaux vintage.  Top Burgundy wines for sale include a case of Vosne-Romanee
Cros Parantoux Henri Jayer 1990, estimated by the auction house
to fetch as much as $110,000. The 1990 is the most expensive
Jayer Cros Parantoux of the past three decades after the 1985
vintage, according to data from the London-based Liv-ex market.  The sale comes as the Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index has risen 
3.5 percent this year, after a drop of 9.7 percent last year,
and has gained for four of the past six months. January auctions
in Hong Kong by Zachys and Acker Merrall & Condit showed that
investors and collectors are looking to take advantage of lower
prices following market declines in 2012, dealers said.  Other Burgundies in the Hart Davis Hart sale include a 12-
bottle  Domaine de la Romanee-Conti  1990 Assortment estimated at
as much as $55,000 and a similar case from 1999 with an upper
price estimate of $35,000.  A case of La Tache DRC from 1996 is estimated at as much as
$24,000, as are six bottles of Montrachet DRC 2009. Two 12-
bottle DRC Assortment cases from 1999 sold for 28,200 pounds
($44,600) each at  Sotheby’s (BID)  in London on Jan. 30.  Christie’s International Plc is also scheduled to hold a
sale in London on Feb. 21, after which the focus switches to New
York with auctions from both Sotheby’s and  Acker Merrall &
Condit  in the city on Feb. 23.  Following is a list of global wine sales scheduled so far
this year. Dates may be subject to revision, and links are to
auction house sale catalogs and websites.
