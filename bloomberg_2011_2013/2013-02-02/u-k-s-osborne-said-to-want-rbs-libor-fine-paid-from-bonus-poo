Chancellor  George Osborne  wants  Royal
Bank of Scotland Group Plc , Britain’s biggest publicly owned
lender, to pay any fines for Libor manipulation from its bonus
pool, a person with knowledge of the situation said.  Osborne wants the fines paid either from this year’s bonus
pool or through clawing back bonuses from previous years, said
the person, who asked not be identified as the chancellor has
not publicly commented on the matter. Osborne has made it clear
any fine should be paid for by the bankers, not taxpayers, the
person said.  An RBS spokesman didn’t immediately respond to an e-mail
seeking comment. The BBC and  Sky News  reported the news earlier
today.  The bank may pay 500 million pounds ($785 million) to 600
million pounds to U.S. and U.K. authorities to settle the Libor
claims, the Financial Times reported today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
