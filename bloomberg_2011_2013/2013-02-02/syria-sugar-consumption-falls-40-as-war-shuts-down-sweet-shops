Syria ’s sugar consumption fell by as
much as 40 percent over the past 12 months as the civil war shut
down its confectionery shops, T. Akhras Group Chairman Tarif
Akhras said today.  Demand for sugar in the Middle Eastern nation fell to
450,000 metric tons to 500,000 tons a year, from 700,000 tons to
750,000 tons a year earlier, Akhras said today in an interview
at the Kingsman sugar conference in Dubai. Akhras’s company is
based in Homs, Syria.  More than 60,000 people have died in the two-year conflict
that pits forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and rebels
who seek an end to the 42-year rule of his family, according to
the  United Nations . Production of foodstuffs including cereals,
fruits and vegetables have dropped by as much as 50 percent,
according to the UN’s  Food and Agriculture Organization  in  Rome .  “Consumption dropped dramatically,” Akhras said. “There
are fewer confectionery, pastry and sweet shops.”  Syria’s sugar imports will fall 400,000 tons to 650,000
tons in the 2012-13 season, the London-based  International Sugar
Organization  estimates. Refiners in Syria are finding it
difficult to import raw sugar because of the sanctions imposed
by Western nations on Assad’s government, said Akhras whose
group used to own a sugar refinery near Homs.  “There are problems receiving raw sugar, sellers are
refraining from supplying,” he said.  The Akhras group may start importing white or refined sugar
into Syria to supply the local market, he said. Imports into
Syria are made mostly by private companies that supply the
government, he said. The country produces sugar from beets, and
some of its local factories can be used to refine raw sugar.  Akhras, who previously chaired the Homs Chamber of
Commerce, was listed under the European Union’s sanctions
against Syria in 2011 for “benefiting from and supporting the
regime,” the Council of the European Union said on Dec.1, 2011.  To contact the reporters on this story:
