Companies kept expanding headcounts
in January and revisions to previous months’ showed even bigger
gains as the U.S. job market made further strides.  Payrolls increased by 157,000 workers following a revised
196,000 gain the prior month and a 247,000 jump in November,
Labor Department figures showed yesterday. Revisions added
127,000 jobs to the tally in the last two months of 2012. A
separate survey of households showed the unemployment rate
unexpectedly rose to 7.9 percent from 7.8 percent.  Brighter employment prospects, which will help lessen the
pain for consumers of a higher payroll tax, sent the  Dow Jones
Industrial Average (INDU)  above 14,000 for the first time since 2007.
At the same time, a jobless rate that Federal Reserve policy
makers have said remains too high means the central bank is
likely to keep pumping money into financial markets.  “The economy continues to turn over and create jobs on a
long, steady path,” said Kevin Logan, chief U.S. economist at
HSBC Securities USA Inc. in New York. “If the unemployment rate
weren’t so high, growth might seem satisfactory because it’s
slow and steady, but we’re still several millions jobs short of
where we were when the recession started. The Fed would like to
see things accelerate, probably closer to 220,000 jobs a month,
which would be a sign of more substantial improvement.”  The U.S. has recovered 5.51 million of the 8.74 million
jobs that were lost as a result of the recession that began in
December 2007 and ended in June 2009.  The Labor Department yesterday also issued its annual
benchmark update, which aligned employment data spanning April
2011 to March 2012 with corporate tax records. The revision
showed payrolls grew by an additional 424,000 workers, on an
unadjusted basis, in that period.  Payroll Revisions  Combined with the updates for November and December, the
revisions put payroll employment at the end of 2012 at 134.7
million workers, 647,000 higher than previously estimated.  The figures were “an encouraging sign for the U.S.
economy,” Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis President James Bullard said in an interview yesterday in  Washington . Payroll
gains averaging about 200,000 jobs over the past three months
are “impressive” and support his forecast that economic growth
will accelerate to about 3 percent this year, he said.  That job growth at the end of 2012 was stronger than first
estimated also showed the economy wasn’t as weak as suggested by
recent figures on the nation’s gross domestic product. GDP
unexpectedly fell at a 0.1 percent annual rate in the fourth
quarter, the worst reading since the recession ended in 2009,
according to Commerce Department data out earlier this week.  The median forecast of 90 economists surveyed by Bloomberg
projected payrolls would climb 165,000 in January. Projections
ranged from increases of 115,000 to 230,000 after an initially
reported 155,000 gain in December.  Unemployment Rate  The unemployment rate was forecast to hold at 7.8 percent
in January, according to the Bloomberg survey median. Estimates
ranged from 7.6 percent to 7.9 percent.  The uptick in joblessness gives bond yields room to decline
amid the Treasury market’s worst annual start since 2009 while
signaling that the Fed may maintain its easing stance for some
time, said  Bill Gross , manager of the world’s biggest bond-fund.  “They will still be writing checks, and it will probably
continue for a while,” the Pacific Investment Management Co.
founder said yesterday in a radio interview on “Bloomberg
Surveillance” with  Tom Keene .  Hiring gains in January were led by health-care providers,
retailers and construction companies. A 28,000 increase for
builder payrolls capped the strongest three-month gain in that
industry since April 2006.  Lowe’s Hiring  Lowe’s Cos. (LOW) , the second-largest U.S. home-improvement
retailer, has benefited from a recovery in the housing market
and is hiring. The Mooresville, North Carolina-based company
said Jan. 22 it will take on 45,000 seasonal workers, 13 percent
more than a year earlier, and add 9,000 permanent employees.  The employment report also contained hopeful signs for the
long-term unemployed. The  average duration  of joblessness fell
by almost three weeks to 35.3, the lowest since December 2010.  Hourly earnings rose 0.2 percent for all workers on average
last month to $23.78 from $23.74 in December, the report showed.
They climbed 2.1 percent from January 2012, matching the
December increase as the biggest since March.  The so-called  underemployment rate  -- which includes part-
time workers who’d prefer a full-time position and people who
want work but have given up looking -- held at 14.4 percent.  Finding Work  Ryan Tiffany, a 31-year-old who lost his finance job in
August, felt better about quickly landing new employment as the
economy showed signs of improving. He began work last month at
Paramount Solar, where he is a solar-power sales specialist.  “I was more nervous about not finding the right fit,”
Tiffany of Roseville,  California , said about his job search,
which he extended to make sure he found the right workplace
environment. He said he now feels more financially secure, and
he and his fiancé are saving up to buy a house.  President  Barack Obama ’s administration used the jobs
report as an opportunity to advocate against steep budget cuts.  “What we see is a job market that’s healing, but it’s not
back to full health,” Alan B. Krueger, chairman of the White
House Council of Economic Advisers, said yesterday during an
interview on Bloomberg Television. “It’s extremely important
that we continue to build on this recovery.”  Congress must “act to avoid self-inflicted wounds to the
economy” as it struggles to avert $85 billion in across-the-
board cuts scheduled to take effect on March 1, Krueger said in
an e-mailed statement.  Lawmakers on Jan. 1 allowed the payroll tax that funds
Social Security benefits to revert to 6.2 percent from 4.2
percent and boosted the levy on top income earners. Congress is
now debating how to approach the automatic spending reductions
that would further crimp growth.  To contact the reporter on this story:
