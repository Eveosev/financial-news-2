AS Roma fired coach Zdenek Zeman, one
day after a 4-2 loss to Caligari extended the Italian soccer
club’s winless run to five matches.  “Our decision today is based on confidence and
consistency,” Roma Chief Executive Italo Zanzi said on the
club’s website. “We faced a difficult situation and addressed
it in a responsible and strategic way.”  Aurelio Andreazzoli has been named interim coach, Zanzi
said. Roma is eighth in Serie A with 34 points, 15 fewer than
league leader Juventus.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
