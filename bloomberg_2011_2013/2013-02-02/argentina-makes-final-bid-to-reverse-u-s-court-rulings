Argentina filed a final brief asking
a U.S. appeals court to reverse rulings that would help Elliott
Management Corp.’s NML Capital Fund among other creditors
collect on sovereign debt the country repudiated more than a
decade ago.  Argentina, which defaulted on a record $95 billion of bonds
in 2001, responded to creditor arguments in its filing yesterday
with the U.S. Court of Appeals in New York. The republic claims
the rulings illegally interfere with its immunity as a sovereign
nation and improperly exert authority over third parties
including banks.  The same appeals court ruled on Oct. 26 that Argentina
can’t treat holders of its restructured debt more favorably than
the so-called holdout creditors, who declined to participate in
two rounds of debt restructuring.  The appeals court also sent part of the case back to U.S.
District Judge Thomas Griesa, who then ordered Argentina to put
into escrow $1.3 billion, the amount claimed by the defaulted
bondholders in the case, when it makes scheduled payments on the
restructured bonds.  Griesa also barred third parties, including banks, from
helping Argentina evade his orders. Those issues are set to be
argued before the appeals court on Feb. 27.  The case is NML Capital Ltd. v. Republic of Argentina,
12-00105, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
(Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
