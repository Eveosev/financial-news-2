The euro touched the highest level
against the dollar in 14 months as the  European Central Bank ’s
balance sheet  contracted  while the  Federal Reserve  said it would
continue pumping money into the  U.S. economy .  The 17-nation currency gained for a second week, its first
back-to-back advance this year, amid data that showed Europe’s
economy may be improving. The yen fell versus the dollar for a
12th straight week, the longest since at least 1971, amid bets
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe will pick a new central-bank governor
who will boost monetary stimulus.  South Korea ’s won slid versus
all of its major peers. The ECB meets Feb. 7 on  interest rates .  “The move in euro has been very dramatic,” Sireen Harajli, a foreign-exchange strategist in New York at Credit
Agricole SA, said in a telephone interview. “The data in
general have been coming up pretty fair in  Europe . I think
they’re indicating the economy in Europe right now at least is
stabilizing.”  The shared currency rallied 1.3 percent to $1.3640 this
week in New York. It touched $1.3711, the strongest level since
Nov. 14, 2011. Against the yen, the euro climbed 3.6 percent,
the most since February 2012, to 126.66 and touched 126.97, the
highest since April 2010.  The dollar reached 92.97 yen, the highest since May 2010,
and gained 2.1 percent on the week to 92.77 yen. It has never
before risen for 12 straight weeks versus the Japanese currency,
according to records compiled by Bloomberg dating to 1971.  Sixth Month  The euro appreciated in January for a sixth month against
both the dollar and the yen. The advance against the greenback
was the longest since May 2003, and the winning streak versus
the Japanese currency was the longest since the euro began
trading in 1999.  “There seems to be no reason to pick a top to the euro’s
strength,”  Marc Chandler , global head of currency strategy at
Brown Brothers Harriman & Co. in New York, said Jan. 28 in an
interview on  Bloomberg Radio ’s “Surveillance” with  Tom Keene  and
 Michael McKee .  The shared currency gained 4.8 percent over the past three
months among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen tumbled 16 percent, the
biggest decline, and the dollar lost 1.1 percent.  The yen tumbled this week as Abe faced a decision on who
will replace BOJ Governor  Masaaki Shirakawa , whose term ends in
April. Abe has pushed for action to spur economic growth and
fight deflation.  The South Korean won had its biggest weekly loss against
the dollar since May amid concern a weak Japanese currency will
hurt the nation’s exports. The won slid 2.1 percent to 1,097.38
to the greenback.  Real, Krona  Brazil ’s real and  Sweden ’s krona were the biggest winners
among the U.S. currency’s 16 most-traded counterparts.  The real gained as the central bank offered dollars to
support it. The currency pared the advance yesterday after a
government official said in an interview the central bank will
avert excessive appreciation. The real gained 2.1 percent to
1.988 per dollar, the biggest weekly jump since Dec. 7.  The krona advanced 2.4 percent to 6.3087 per dollar and
touched 6.2785, the strongest since August 2011. It added 0.4
percent to 8.6058 to the euro.  The European currency gained yesterday versus the dollar
and yen as a gauge of  manufacturing  in the 17-nation region in
January rose to the highest in almost a year. The purchasing-
manager index increased to 47.9, the most since February 2012,
London-based Markit Economics said. It has been below the 50
level that signals contraction for 18 months.  Balance Sheet  The ECB’s balance sheet fell to 2.93 trillion euros ($4
trillion) in the week ended Jan. 25, the lowest since February
2012. The central bank hasn’t purchased sovereign debt for 45
straight weeks.  Banks repaid 137.2 billion euros of emergency three-year
loans to the ECB this week, the Frankfurt-based central bank
said in a statement Jan. 31. Another 3.5 billion euros are
expected to be returned next week, it said.  The ECB won’t increase its 0.75 percent benchmark  interest
rate  at its meeting next week, a Bloomberg survey forecast.  The euro climbed yesterday as a strengthening U.S. jobs
market and bets that the Federal Reserve will sustain stimulus
to ensure the recovery boosted investors’ risk appetite.  Payrolls in the U.S. rose by 157,000 jobs in January,
versus a Bloomberg survey’s forecast of a gain of 165,000, Labor
Department figures showed. The  unemployment rate  unexpectedly
rose to 7.9 percent, from 7.8 percent.  ‘Sweet Spot’  “The jobs report hit the sweet spot of not being too strong
and not being too weak,”  Nick Bennenbroek , head of currency
strategy at  Wells Fargo & Co . in New York, said in a telephone
interview. “It was strong enough to diminish some of the
downside worries, but it wasn’t so strong that you had a
situation where you’d be concerned about the Federal Reserve
accelerating any shift in its monetary-policy approach.”  The Fed said Jan. 30 after a two-day policy meeting that it
will keep purchasing $85 billion of Treasury and mortgage
securities each month to spur the economy. The purchases will
continue “if the outlook for the labor market does not improve
substantially,” policy makers said  The central bank left unchanged its statement that its
target  interest rate  will stay close to zero as long as
unemployment remains above 6.5 percent and projected inflation
stays below 2.5 percent.  “As long as it’s not 6.5 percent, Bernanke has to continue
being a dove,” Doug Borthwick, a managing director and head of
foreign exchange at Chapdelaine FX in  New York , said yesterday
in a telephone interview.  To contact the reporter on this story:
