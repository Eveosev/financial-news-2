Super Bowl-winning coach  Bill Parcells  and former offensive lineman Jonathan Ogden of the
Baltimore Ravens are among seven who will be enshrined in the
Pro Football Hall of Fame.  The inductees include offensive lineman  Larry Allen ,
defensive tackle Warren Sapp, wide receiver Cris Carter, and
senior candidates Curley Culp and Dave Robinson.  “It’s just unbelievable, it’s exhilarating,” Parcells
said in an interview shown on the NFL Network.  Nominees need at least 80 percent of the vote from the 46-
member selection committee, which announced the members of the
51st Hall of Fame class in New Orleans yesterday, before today’s
Super Bowl.  They will be enshrined Aug. 3 at the Hall of Fame
in Canton, Ohio.  Missing the cut were defensive end Michael Strahan, wide
receivers  Tim Brown , Andre Reed, cornerback Aeneas Williams,
owners Ed DeBartolo Jr. and Art Modell, linebacker Kevin Greene,
guard Will Shields, running back  Jerome Bettis  and  linebacker
Charles Haley.  Parcells, 71, coached the Giants from 1983-90, the  New
England Patriots  from 1993-96, the  New York  Jets from 1997-99,
and the Dallas Cowboys from 2003-06. He won Super Bowls with the
Giants after the 1986 and 1990 seasons, and was a finalist last
year for the Hall of Fame.  In 19 seasons as a head coach, Parcells had five losing
seasons and led his teams to first or second place in their
division 11 times. Selected as NFL Coach of the Year in 1986 and
1994, he has an overall record of 172-130-1 in the regular
season and 11-8 in the playoffs.  Parcells’ Turnarounds  “He had his own unique style in building a successful
organization and instilled a winning mindset at all levels as
both a coach and executive,” Miami Dolphins Chairman Stephen Ross said in a statement. “While he might have had different
levels of success at each of the teams he worked for, he always
left each franchise far better off than how he found it.”  Parcells turned around four teams including the Giants, who
had one winning season in the 10 years before he took over in
1983. After a 3-12-1 season in his first year, the Giants made
the postseason as a wild-card team the next two years. In 1986,
the Giants went 14-2 and finished the year with a victory
against the  Denver Broncos  in Super Bowl XXI. Four years later,
the Giants won their second Super Bowl with a 20-19 victory
against the  Buffalo Bills  in Super Bowl XXV.  Playoff Contender  “He turned our franchise around,” Giants co-owner  John Mara  said in a statement. “We went through a long period in the
1960s and 70s when we were a laughingstock. When Bill took over
in 1983 he survived a very difficult first year, but then turned
us into a perennial playoff contender and won two Super Bowls
for us.”  After a two-year absence from the NFL, he returned to coach
the New England Patriots, who went from 2-14 to 10-6 and their
first playoff game in eight years during two years under
Parcells. They went on to win the American Football Conference
championship two years later and a spot in Super Bowl XXXI.  Parcells in 1997 joined the  New York Jets , who were coming
off a 1-15 season in 1996. Within two years, the Jets were 12-4
and had advanced to the AFC championship game. It was the best
two-year turnaround of a 1-15 team in NFL history.  Cowboys Playoffs  As head coach of the  Dallas Cowboys , Parcells led the team
to two playoff appearances.  Ogden, 48, was the first draft pick, fourth overall of the
1996 NFL draft, from UCLA. The 11-time Pro Bowl selection spent
12 seasons with the Ravens.  “This is the highlight of my life,” Ogden, the first
draft pick ever made by the Baltimore Ravens, said on the NFL
Network.  By 2000, Ogden anchored the offensive line from his left
tackle spot. That season, with a 12-4 record, the Ravens
defeated the New York Giants 34-7 in Super Bowl XXXV.  Ogden helped clear the way for Jamal Lewis to become the
fifth player in NFL history to eclipse 2,000 yards rushing in a
season in 2003.  Bucs Draftee  Sapp, 40, gave up his senior season at the University of
Miami to enter the 1995 NFL Draft where he was picked 12th
overall by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. During 13 seasons,
including four with the  Oakland Raiders , he recorded 96.5 career
sacks and set a Buccaneers’ team record with 16.5 sacks in 2000.  In 1999, he helped Tampa Bay win its first division title
in 18 seasons, tallying 12.5 sacks, 54 tackles, three forced
fumbles and two recovered fumbles. Three years later, Tampa Bay
finished 12-4-0 and went on to defeat Oakland 48-21 in Super
Bowl XXXVII with the help of Sapp’s two tackles, one sack for
nine yards, two passes defensed and a forced fumble.  Sapp was voted to seven Pro Bowls.  Allen, 41, the 46 overall pick in the 1994 draft by the
Dallas Cowboys, started 10 games in his rookie season and split
time between guard and tackle. In his second season, he was
placed in the right guard spot and helped running back  Emmitt Smith  set a Cowboys single-season record with 1,773 yards
rushing.  An 11-time Pro Bowl selection, Allen is a veteran of 203
career games, playing in two NFC championship games and the
Cowboys’ 27-17 victory over the Steelers in Super Bowl XXX.  More Honors  He was named the NFL’s Offensive Lineman of the Year by the
NFL Alumni in 1997 and by the NFL Players Association as the NFC
Offensive Lineman of the Year in 1996 and 1997.  Carter, 47, ranks fourth in career receptions with 1,101
and 130 touchdowns during his 16-season NFL career that began
when he was a fourth-round pick of the  Philadelphia Eagles  in
the 1987 supplemental draft.  He joined Minnesota in 1990 and led the Vikings in
receptions for 10 straight seasons from 1991-2000. In 1993, he
had his first of eight straight 1,000-yard seasons and earned
the first of eight consecutive Pro Bowl selections.  His career-best season in 1995 was highlighted by his
second straight 122-catch season in which he totaled a career-
high 1,371 yards and 17 touchdowns.  Carter retired temporarily following the 2001 season. He
returned in 2002 to help the injury-plagued Miami Dolphins’
receiving squad for five games.  He ended his career with 13,899 yards receiving. He
recorded 70 or more catches in a season 10 times and had 100-
yard receiving games 42 times.  Senior Candidates  Culp, 66, was selected in the second round of the 1968
draft by the Denver Broncos. The team tried to switch him to
offensive guard from defensive tackle, and when it didn’t work
out, the Broncos traded him to the  Kansas City Chiefs .  The Chiefs kept him on defense and he had four tackles, two
assists and a sack as Kansas City beat the Oakland Raiders 17-7
in the 1969 American Football League Championship game and then
tallied three tackles and one assist in the Chiefs’ 23-7  Super
Bowl  victory over the  Minnesota Vikings .  Culp made back-to-back appearances in the AFC championship
game in 1978 and 1979. He was named to one AFL All-Star Game and
five Pro Bowls during his career. He played in 179 career games
that included a final stint with the  Detroit Lions .  Robinson, 71, joined the  Green Bay Packers  as the team’s
first-round pick out of Penn State University in the 1963 NFL
Draft. During 12 years, including two with the  Washington
Redskins , he intercepted 27 passes.  A three-time Pro Bowl pick, he started at left outside
linebacker in three NFL championship victories and two Super
Bowl wins. He contributed three tackles in Green Bay’s 35-10 win
over the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I and then had two
tackles, five assisted tackles, one fumble recovery and a pass
defensed in Super Bowl II as the Packers beat the Oakland
Raiders 33-14.  Robinson suffered an Achilles tendon injury in 1970 that
limited him to just four games. He rebounded the following
season and didn’t miss a game for the Packers in 1971 and 1972
before moving on to the Redskins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
