China  plans to relax restrictions on
brokerages’ expansion as regulators seek to encourage securities
companies to compete and diversify.  The China Securities Regulatory Commission will lift
restrictions such as limits on the location and number of new
branches that brokerages can open, it said in draft rules posted
on its  website  on Jan. 31. Under the new rules, the regulator
will no longer specify and restrict the businesses of new
securities branches, it said.  Demand for financial services is growing in smaller cities
nationwide as China’s economy expands, the regulator said. More
than 60 percent of the country’s 2,003 counties do not have a
securities outlet, it said. The relaxation of rules accommodates
“internal and external changes” that brokerages face, the
regulator said.  Guo Shuqing, chairman of the CSRC, has encouraged dividend
payments, tightened rules on delisting companies and cut trading
costs to boost the appeal of Asia’s third-largest stock market.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
