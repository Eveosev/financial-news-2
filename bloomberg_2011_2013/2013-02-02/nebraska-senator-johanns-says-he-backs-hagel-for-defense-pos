Nebraska Senator Mike Johanns, a
Republican, said today he’ll vote to confirm former Nebraska
Senator Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense, the Lincoln Journal
Star  reported , citing a telephone interview with Johanns.  Hagel, a 66-year-old Republican selected for the job by
Democratic President  Barack Obama , faced criticism from fellow
Republicans during a Jan. 31 confirmation hearing over issues
such as his opposition to the 2007 U.S. troop surge in Iraq and
about his stances on nuclear arms reduction and Israel policy.  Johann’s Communications Director, Nick Simpson, declined to
comment further than the Journal Star article.  To contact the reporter on this story:
