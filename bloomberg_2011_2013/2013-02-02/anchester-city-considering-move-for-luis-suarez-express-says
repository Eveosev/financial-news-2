Manchester City is considering a 40
million pound ($63 million) bid for Liverpool striker  Luis
Suarez  to fill the gap left by Mario Balotelli’s departure, the
Daily Express reported.  Suarez, who’s scored 22 goals this season, has vowed to
stay at Liverpool should the club fail to qualify for the
Champions League and City manager Roberto Mancini is ready to
test his loyalty, the Express said.  City sold Balotelli to AC Milan two days ago. Mancini may
also move out strikers Edin Dzeko and  Carlos Tevez  after the
season, the Express said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
