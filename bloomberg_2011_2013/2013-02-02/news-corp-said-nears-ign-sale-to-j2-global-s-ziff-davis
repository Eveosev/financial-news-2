News Corp. (NWSA)  is close to an agreement
to sell its IGN Entertainment websites to  J2 Global Inc. (JCOM) ’s Ziff
Davis, two people with knowledge of the situation said.  The price will be less than the $100 million News Corp.
sought for the business, said the people, who requested
anonymity because a deal hasn’t been announced.  Rupert Murdoch , chairman and chief executive officer of
News Corp., is leaving some businesses as his New York-based
media company prepares to split into separate publishing and
entertainment entities. IGN was once part of an interactive
division that included MySpace.  Kris Sharbaugh, a spokeswoman for IGN in San Francisco,
declined to comment. Jeff Adelman, a spokesman for Los Angeles-
based J2 Global, didn’t return messages seeking comment.  IGN operates  Gamespy.com , devoted to video games, and
Askmen.com, which offers advice on sports and grooming.
AllThingsD reported the pending sale yesterday.  News Corp. gained 1.5 percent to $28.16 yesterday in New
York. The Class A stock has  climbed  10 percent this year. J2
Global, which bought Ziff Davis publishing in November, rose 0.2
percent to $31.87 and has gained 4.2 percent this year.  To contact the reporters on this story:
