Kittiratt Na-Ranong,  Thailand ’s
deputy prime minister and commerce minister, comments on the
government’s plan to raise the minimum wage. He spoke to
reporters in Bangkok today.  The government plans to raise the minimum wage to 300 baht
per day and increase monthly salaries for degree holders to
15,000 baht, starting in January. The government plans to cut
corporate income taxes and reduce oil prices to help companies
cope with rising costs.  “The wage rise will lead to a change in the balance of the
Thai economy. Apart from government agencies and state
enterprises, many big companies are also ready for the raise.  ‘‘Though the wage will raise production costs, I believe
lower taxes and  oil prices  will compensate for that. So,
inflation won’t surge after the wage rise. What I want to see
next is the monetary policy committee should review local
 interest rates , making sure they are not too high, to avoid an
impact on production costs.’’  The government will help some small and medium-sized
companies that are adversely affected by the wage rise by
providing training and assistance to purchase machinery,
Kittiratt said. Some stronger SMEs will be forced to begin
paying tax, he said.  ‘‘For those who can’t increase efficiency, they may need to
accept the truth that they should cut production, stop
production or change to other businesses. They need to review
themselves, because the government has already sent signals on
the wage rise.’’  To contact the reporter on this story:
