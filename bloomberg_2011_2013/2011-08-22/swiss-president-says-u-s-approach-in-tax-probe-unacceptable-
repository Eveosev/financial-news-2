Swiss President Micheline Calmy-Rey
said the way U.S. tax authorities are seeking information from
Switzerland on alleged  tax evasion  by Americans  is “legally
unacceptable.”  “These means are too drawn out, legally unacceptable or
politically unjustifiable,” Calmy-Rey said in the text of a
speech given today in Lucerne, Switzerland.  Switzerland said in June that it was in talks with the U.S.
to resolve the issue of untaxed assets held by American citizens
in Swiss bank accounts. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service and
the  Justice Department  have stepped up enforcement to combat
offshore tax evasion after  UBS AG (UBSN) , Switzerland’s biggest bank,
handed over data on 4,450 accounts to resolve a lawsuit.  “I don’t think there’s an agreement on the table,” Donald Beyer, U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, said in an interview in
Geneva today. “The Americans and Justice, the IRS, and
certainly the Swiss leaders, would like to find a solution that
works for everybody.”  UBS avoided prosecution by paying $780 million, admitting
it fostered tax evasion, and giving the IRS data on more than
250 accounts. U.S. prosecutors told  Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN)  last
month that it’s a target of a probe into its former cross-border
banking services to American customers.  To contact the reporters on this story:
