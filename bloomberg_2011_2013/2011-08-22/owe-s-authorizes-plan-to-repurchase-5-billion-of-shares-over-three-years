Lowe’s Cos., the second-largest U.S.
home-improvement retailer, said it plans to buy back $5 billion
of its own stock over the next two-to-three years.  Repurchases will be subject to market conditions and will
be made in the open market or through private transactions, the
Mooresville, North Carolina-based company said today in a
statement. The buyback program may be suspended, discontinued or
resumed at any time, Lowe’s also said.  The retailer said last week that profit in fiscal 2011 will
be less than it previously projected amid a decline in sales at
stores open a year or more. Homeowners buffeted by unemployment,
declining stock portfolios and sagging property values are
delaying kitchen, bathroom and other projects.   Lowe’s fell 27 cents to $19.31 in New York Stock Exchange
trading Aug. 19, the last day the shares changed hands. The
stock has tumbled 23 percent this year.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
