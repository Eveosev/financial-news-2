Nakheel PJSC, the developer of man-
made islands off Dubaiâ€™s coast, signed contracts to expand an
existing mall and build two shopping centers in Dubai.  The company reached a deal with Dar Al-handasah to design
and supervise the addition of 1.7 million square feet (158,000
square meters) of retail space and 5,000 parking spaces at its
Dragon Mart Mall, Nakheel said in an e-mailed statement today.  Nakheel also appointed Arif and Bintoak Consulting
Architects and Engineers to design and supervise the building of
two community shopping centers at its Jumeirah Park and
Discovery Gardens projects, it said.  The developer is restructuring $13 billion of debt after
the global recession caused property demand in Dubai to
evaporate.  Home prices  slid by more than 60 percent from their
peak in mid-2008, forcing developers to cancel and delay
projects.  The Jumeirah Park shopping center will provide 50,000
square feet for stores serving both the Jumeirah Park and
Jumeirah Island communities. In Discovery Gardens, the 140,000
square foot project will include stores and a recreation center
catering to its Al Furjan development.  Construction on the three projects is set to start in the
first half of 2012, the company said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
