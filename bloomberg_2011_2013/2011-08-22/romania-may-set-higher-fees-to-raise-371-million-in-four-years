Romania ’s government wants to
increase royalties for natural-gas storage, crude-oil transport
and mineral resources and raise about 1.1 billion lei ($371
million) over the next four years.  The government plans to increase the royalty to 15 percent
of revenue from crude-oil transport from the current 10 percent
and to 5 percent for underground gas storage from 3 percent,
according to  a draft law  published on the Finance Ministry’s
website. It also wants to raise mineral royalty payments,
without specifying percentage changes.  “The proposed changes to the mineral and oil laws will
increase royalty payments and have a positive financial
impact,” according to the draft. “Budget revenue from the
proposed royalty payments would rise by about 117 million lei in
the last five months of this year.”  The Balkan nation is trying to bring in more revenue from
the  energy industry  to the state budget as it cuts spending to
meet pledges to the  International Monetary Fund  and the European
Union and reduce its  budget deficit  to below 3 percent of gross
domestic product from next year.  It plans to sell minority stakes in two utilities, natural-
gas producer Romgaz SA and oil company  OMV Petrom SA (SNP)  this year
and next to raise funds for infrastructure projects. State-owned
Romgaz and Petrom together hold about 83 percent of the gas
market, while the rest comes from imports. Conpet SA is the
operator of the national oil-transport grid.  To contact the reporter on this story:
