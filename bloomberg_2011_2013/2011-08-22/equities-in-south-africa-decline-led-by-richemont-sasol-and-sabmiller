The FTSE/JSE  Africa  All Share Index
rose for a second day, advancing 54.43, or 0.2 percent, to
29,433.12 by the 5 p.m. close in Johannesburg. The index
declined 1.5 percent last week.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
South African market today.  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  , Africa’s largest gold
producer, rose to its highest in almost four months, gaining
8.28 rand, or 2.6 percent, to 333 rand. Gold rallied for a sixth
day to an all-time high as a global economic slowdown and the
European debt crisis boosted demand for a haven.  Gold Fields Ltd. (GFI)  , Africa’s second-biggest gold
producer, added 4.05 rand, or 3.4 percent, to 124.65 rand.  DRDGold Ltd. (DRD)  ,  South Africa ’s fourth-largest
producer of the metal, gained 17 cents, or 5.2 percent, to 3.44
rand.  Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  , the fourth-biggest
platinum miner, closed at a two-week low, dropping 1.73 rand, or
6 percent, to 27.27 rand. The Zimbabwean government rejected the
plan by Aquarius Platinum’s Mimosa Holdings unit to sell stakes
to black Zimbabweans as required by law, calling for a revised
proposal by the end of the month. Mimosa accounted for 25
percent of Aquarius’s revenue in the year ended June, according
to the company’s website.        Grindrod Ltd. (GND)  , Africa’s biggest shipping company,
rose the most in almost three months, gaining 80 cents, or 6.1
percent, to 14 rand. The group said it has entered negotiations
with an unidentified partner that may result in a capital
injection of as much as 2 billion rand ($276 million).  Harmony Gold Mining Co. (HAR SJ), Africa’s third-largest
gold company, rose 4.02 rand, or 4.6 percent, to 90.92 rand,
recovering from a 5.2 percent fall on Aug. 19. Reported plans to
shift mineral ownership in  Papua New Guinea  to local communities
from the state could complicate negotiations but nationalization
was not being discussed, Chief Executive Officer Graham Briggs
told Reuters. Harmony owns half of the Wafi-Golpu and Hidden
Valley mines in Papua New Guinea.  Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd. (IMP)  , the world’s second-
largest producer of the metal, advanced for the first day in
three, gaining 1.49 rand, or 0.9 percent, to 167.99 rand. The
miner said the Number 10 shaft at its Rustenburg operation in
South Africa resumed production after a fatal accident on Aug.
16 prompted a stoppage.  Sasol Ltd. (SOL)  , the world’s largest maker of motor
fuel from coal, declined 2.51 rand, or 0.8 percent, to 309.99
rand. Brent oil fell as much as 3.2 percent in  London , narrowing
its record premium to U.S. futures, as investors bet that Libyan
production may recover after rebels entered the capital city of
Tripoli in a push to force out leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  SacOil Holding Ltd. (SCL)  , an African oil and natural-
gas explorer, fell for a third day, dropping 3 cents, or 4.6
percent, to 62 cents.  To contact the reporter on this story:
