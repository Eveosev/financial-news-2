Gulf Coast  gasoline weakened as
Hurricane Irene moved toward the southeastern Bahamas on a path
that may take it to  South Carolina .  The  current track forecast  predicts Irene will hug the
eastern Florida coast and strike South Carolina on Aug. 27 as at
least a Category 3 hurricane, which is considered a major storm.  “As far as energy purposes it looks like the Gulf is going
to get away from this one,” Travis Hartman, meteorologist with
MDA EarthSat Weather in Gaithersburg, Maryland.  The discount for conventional, 87-octane gasoline in the
Gulf Coast widened 0.63 cent to 5.13 cents a gallon versus
futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange at 2:09 p.m.,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Prompt delivery fell
2.24 cents to $2.7738 a gallon.  The discount for conventional gasoline to be blended with
ethanol, or CBOB, in New York Harbor, narrowed 0.12 cent to 0.38
cent a gallon.  Tesoro Corp. (TSO)  started an alkylation unit late yesterday at
its Wilmington refinery in California after a power outage, Mike Marcy, a spokesman for the company, said in an e-mail.  The premium for California-reformulated gasoline, or
Carbob, in  Los Angeles , rose 0.38 cent to 8.13 cents a gallon.  The same fuel in  San Francisco  weakened 1.5 cents to a
premium of 10.25 cents a gallon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
