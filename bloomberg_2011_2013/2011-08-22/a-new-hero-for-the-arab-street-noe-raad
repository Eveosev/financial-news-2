Aug. 22 (Bloomberg) -- The Arab Street has a new hero. Dubbed Flagman or the Egyptian Spiderman on Facebook and Twitter, young Ahmad Ash-Shahat scaled  Israel 's embassy in Cairo and replaced its flag with  Egypt 's. This was in response to the death of three Egyptian policemen last week during clashes that followed a series of attacks by gunmen who killed eight Israelis near the Israeli resort city of Eilat. Egypt blames the Israeli military for killing the policemen in its pursuit of the gunmen, who fled into Egypt's  Sinai peninsula . Israel says the gunmen infiltrated Israel from the Sinai. Israel has expressed regret for the death of the policemen and has said it is investigating whether its forces may have been inadvertently to blame. For most of the commentators who took up the matter in the Arabic media, Israel's culpability is a given, the issue of whether the deaths were accidental an irrelevance. For them, Ahmad Ash-Shahat's mounting of the Israeli embassy, during mass protests after the death of the Egyptian policemen, was an expression of triumph over a country that is a source of resentment. Wrote  Abdel-Beri Atwan , the editor in chief of the Palestinian owned, London-based Al-Quds al-Arabi: Under the rule of former Egyptian president  Hosni Mubarak , a close ally of the U.S., popular criticism of Israel was muted in Egypt. But those days are over, as  Makram Mohammad Ahmad  noted in his column in the semi-official Egyptian daily Al-Ahram. Israelis, he wrote, have “failed to understand that Egypt has changed and that, in spite of its current keenness on preserving the peace in the region, it is now even keener on preserving the dignity of the nation.” Regular Egyptians have “grown impatient” with the Israel-Egypt peace treaty, which, Ahmad argued, does not enable Egypt to properly secure the Sinai area, given treaty limits on Egyptian troop deployments. Since Mubarak's fall, operations of a pipeline that sends Egyptian natural gas to Israel and Jordan have been disrupted after four attacks on the line in the Sinai. Wrote Ahmad: In an  editorial , the Egyptian daily Al-Gumhouriyya wrote: Needless to say, key voices from the militant Palestinian movement Hamas joined in. The group’s top political advisor,  Dr. Yusuf Rizqah , wrote in the Gaza-based paper Filastin that “New Egypt” is shaking off “the dust of its humiliation and dependency on Israel after the ousting of Mubarak’s regime, which legitimized dependency and submission to  Tel Aviv . " The lambasting of Israel in the regional media went so far that justifications for the original attack on Israelis, the deadliest since 2008, were pervasive. Although commentators in dailies that support Palestinian President  Mahmoud Abbas  generally expressed their disdain for the methods used in the Eilat attack -- especially since it targeted mainly civilians -- some argued that Israel provoked the extremism with intransigence over the  peace process  and expansion of Jewish settlements in the  West Bank . The operation shows what can happen on Israel’s borders with the Arab countries, wrote  Hafez Al-Barghouti , editor-in-chief of the daily Al-Hayat Al-Jadidah, which is owned by the  Palestinian Authority . Columnist  Adel Abd Al-Rahman  wrote in the same paper that even more deadly operations would be carried out in the future due to Israel's “criminal” handling of negotiations with the Palestinians: Still, some commentators, especially in Saudi-owned media, noted that pouring scorn on Israel is an old habit, born of the need to deflect attention from internal Arab problems. Columnist  Husam Itani  of the London-based, Saudi owned Al-Hayat wrote that relations between Israel and Egypt truly were tense and added, "One cannot deny the existence of other sides with the capability and need to shift attention away from their own fronts and their current predicaments.” He explained further that the Palestinian “armed struggle” is still used, as it was in the 1970s, as “a valid mailbox through which the Arab regimes can send regional, international and internal messages." Itani suggested that  Syria  may have played a role in the attacks in Israel in an effort to divert attention from its violent crackdown against domestic protesters. He concluded that there is “no eluding the fact that this type of action now needs thorough reconsideration, to say the least.” The transformations seen in the region over the past year, he wrote, herald “the beginning of a new historical stage, and blind are those who do not see it.” His was a quiet voice, however, amid the praise for the Egyptian Spiderman.
