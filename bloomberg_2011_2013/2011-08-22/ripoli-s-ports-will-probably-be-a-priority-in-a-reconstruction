Tripoli’s port facilities will
probably be a priority in any reconstruction effort, according
to AKE Group, a risk analysis company based in Hereford,
 England .  “If there is a reconstruction effort for the country as a
whole, the port facilities will likely be secured as early as
possible by the transitional council or any international peace-
keeping force if one is deployed,” said John Drake, senior risk
consultant, by phone from London. Shipping has been the most
effective means for getting supplies into the country, he said.  Libyan rebels swept into Tripoli, capturing two of Muammar
Qaddafi’s eldest sons, Saif al-Islam and Mohammed al-Qaddafi, as
the battle to end his 42 years of autocratic rule arrived at the
doorstep of his presidential compound.  To contact the reporter on this story:
