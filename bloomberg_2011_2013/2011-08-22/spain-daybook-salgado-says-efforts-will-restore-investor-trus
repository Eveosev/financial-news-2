Finance Minister  Elena Salgado  said
she’s confident Spain’s deficit-reduction efforts will restore
investor trust and end the need for European authorities to
support the nation’s bonds.  ECONOMY:  *Euro-region governments can’t let Finnish demands for
collateral derail a second rescue package for Greece, Spanish
Finance Minister Elena Salgado said, as she predicted nations
will approve the rescue in September.  *Foreign-exchange traders are putting their faith in  Jean-Claude Trichet , betting the European Central Bank President will
save the euro from a collapse predicted by everyone from  George
Soros  to  Paul Volcker .  *Italy’s austerity drive, enacted in exchange for European
Central Bank bond purchases driving down borrowing costs, may
backfire as it chokes the economic growth needed to ease
Europe’s second-biggest debt burden.  EQUITIES:  * Abengoa SA (ABG) , Spain’s largest biofuel producer, was offered
a $139.9 million loan guarantee from the U.S. Energy Department
to build a cellulosic ethanol plant in Hugoton,  Kansas .  *Banca Civica SA, the Spanish lender that carried out an
initial public offering last month, said Credit Suisse Group AG
bought 23.2 million of its shares lender during the
stabilization period for the stock that ended Aug. 19.  * Telefonica SA (TEF)  was introduced as least preferred stock at
Citigroup within European telecommunications services sector.  MARKETS:  *The  IBEX 35 Index (IBEX)  lost 2.1 percent to 8,141.90.  *The  spread  between Spanish and German 10-year borrowing
costs narrowed to 286.1 basis points.  To contact the reporter on this story:
