Eni SpA (ENI)  Chairman Giuseppe Recchi
said there is no threat that a new Libyan government will try to
renegotiate the nation’s energy contracts with the Italian  oil
company , the biggest investor in  Libya .  Eni’s contracts are protected by international law, he said
in an interview in Rimini,  Italy .  The end of the conflict will be “very positive” for Eni
as it will allow the company to restart production.  Prior to the conflict, Libya accounted for about 13 percent
of Eni’s annual revenue, 20 percent of Italy’s natural gas
imports and 25 percent of oil imports.  To contact the reporter on this story:
