Mauritius’s rupee appreciated the
most in more than three weeks against the euro.  The currency gained as much as 2.6 percent, its biggest
intraday advance since July 28, to 39.8157 per euro and traded
1.9 percent down to 40.0932 at 3:35 p.m. in  Port Louis , the
capital, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Versus the
dollar, the rupee weakened as much as 0.7 percent and traded 0.5
percent up at 27.80.  “The market is very volatile today, driven by a lack of
substantial volume trading,” Fabien Gebert, a treasurer at GML,
which describes itself is the biggest Mauritian  investment
company  by assets, said by phone. “There might be a kind of
wait-and-see attitude from sellers and buyers as end-of-month
bill settlements loom, contributing to swings in the rates.”  Europe is the Indian Ocean island nation’s biggest trading
partner, with France and  Italy  buying  22 percent of the
country’s exports  in June, the  Central Statistics Office  said
today. Tourism, which with textiles is the country’s biggest
foreign-currency earner, is driven by visitors from  Europe , with
a share of 64 percent, the data agency said on Aug. 18.  Mauritius is a net buyer of food and fuels, with 67 percent
of its import bills denominated in dollars, according to Bank of
Mauritius data.  Buying prices for the dollar were from 27.2413 to 27.41
rupees, while the selling price was 28.7064 per dollar, versus
28.7425 on Aug. 19, according to indicative exchange rates
published today on the  Bank of Mauritius’s website .  Mauritian stocks retreated for a fourth day, its longest
streak of losses since July 21. The 38-member SEMDEX gauge
declined 0.3 percent to 1,913.75 at the 1:30 p.m. close, led by
Mauritius Commercial Bank, the country’s largest lender by
market value.  To contact the reporter on this story:
