Mahmoud Al Zoubi for Transport, an
Amman-based freight company, won a tender to ferry 30,000 metric
tons of  fuel oil  per month from  Iraq  to Jordan, the nationâ€™s
official news agency  Petra  said.  The company will transport the fuel to Aqaba Thermal Power
Station in the south of Jordan for 37.3 dinars ($52.65) per ton,
which was the lowest price offered in the tender, it said,
citing Fayez Abu Gahoud, an energy ministry spokesman.  The fuel will be used to generate electricity at the power
station to compensate for the shortage in natural gas that has
been halted for weeks after attacks on the pipeline network in
 Egypt , it said.  Iraq agreed in June to increase daily oil exports to Jordan
to 15,000 barrels from 10,000 barrels and supply its neighbour
with 30,000 tons of heavy fuel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
