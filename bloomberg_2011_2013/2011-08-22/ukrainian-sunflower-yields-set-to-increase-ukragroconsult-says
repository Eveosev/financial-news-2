Ukraineâ€™s sunflower crop is in good
condition and set to produce yields that are higher than last
year, UkrAgroConsult said.  The researcher probably will raise its forecast for the
sunflower harvest to 8.5 million metric tons from the 8.2
million tons estimated a week ago, according to an e-mailed
statement today from Kiev-based UkrAgroConsult.  To contact the reporter on this story:
