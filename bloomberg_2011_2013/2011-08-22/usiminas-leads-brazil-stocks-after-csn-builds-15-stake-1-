Usinas Siderurgicas de Minas Gerais
SA (USIM5) ,  Brazil ’s second-largest steelmaker, led gains in Sao Paulo
trading after Cia. Siderurgica Nacional SA boosted its stake in
the rival to more than 15 percent.  Common shares of Usiminas, as the  Belo Horizonte , Brazil-
based company is known, rose 4.8 percent to close at 23.15
reais, the biggest gain on Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa Index. The
company’s preferred shares climbed 3.6 percent, the second-
biggest increase on the index.  Sao Paulo-based CSN, Brazil’s third-largest steelmaker by
crude-steel output, said in a regulatory filing on Aug. 19 it
boosted its stake to 15.15 percent of Usiminas’s preferred
shares and 11.29 percent of the common stock. That’s up from
10.2 percent of preferred shares and 10.84 percent of common
stock as of July 27.  “The company continues assessing strategic alternatives
regarding its investment in Usiminas,” CSN said in the
statement, adding that it doesn’t have any options or an accord
to buy additional shares.  CSN has been buying stock in its bigger rival since at
least January, when the company said it may increase its stake
in Usiminas to a level that could alter management or the
control structure. CSN Chief Financial Officer Alberto Monteiro
said Aug. 3 on an earnings conference call that the company was
analyzing buying more Usiminas shares.  CSN lost 17 centavos, or 1.2 percent, to 13.88 reais,
extending its drop for 2011 to 48 percent. Gerdau SA,  Latin
America ’s largest steelmaker, rose 1 percent to 12.70 reais.  To contact the reporter on this story:
