China ’s yuan forwards climbed for
the first time in five days after the central bank set the
currency’s reference rate stronger, spurring speculation policy
makers will allow faster appreciation to contain inflation.  The People’s Bank of China raised its daily fixing 0.05
percent to 6.3997 per dollar. Consumer prices in Asia’s largest
economy climbed 6.5 percent from a year earlier in July, the
most since June 2008, government data show.  “The PBOC fixed the yuan stronger and that helps yuan NDFs
lean toward a stronger end,” said Thio Chin Loo, a senior
currency analyst at BNP Paribas SA in  Singapore . “The currency
could be used a bit more vigorously because it will help contain
imported inflation, which is one of the key issues in China.”  Twelve-month non-deliverable forwards gained 0.04 percent
to 6.2855 as of 5:04 p.m. in  Hong Kong , according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. The premium to the onshore spot rate was
1.8 percent.  The yuan slipped 0.13 percent to 6.4013 per dollar in
 Shanghai , the biggest one-day fall since May 23, according to
the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. In Hong Kong’s offshore
market, the yuan advanced 0.03 percent to 6.3735.  U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was in China last week as
part of his three-nation Asia tour. Central bankers from around
the world will meet at an annual conference sponsored by the
 Federal Reserve  at Jackson Hole,  Wyoming . Record-low yields on
U.S. Treasuries show traders expect Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke
to signal as soon as this week that the central bank will begin
a third round of bond-buying that expands the supply of dollars,
known as quantative easing, to boost the world’s largest economy.  “Investors are locking in profits after the yuan has
outperformed in the past weeks,” said Kenix Lai, a senior
market analyst at Bank of East  Asia  in Hong Kong. “The end of
Biden’s visit to China also signals a temporary retreat of the
yuan against the dollar. The dollar is likely to stay weak as
investors expect Bernanke may hint that another round of
quantitative easing is on the way.”  -- Judy Chen , Fion Li. Editors: Anil Varma, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
