TransCentury Ltd. of  Kenya  plans to
issue an additional 7 million shares valued at 280 million
shillings ($3 million) to reduce its debt, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing a statement by the company.  The value of TransCenturyâ€™s shares, which were listed on
the  Nairobi Stock Exchange  on July 14, may be diluted by the
additional stock, which is meant to clear part of a convertible
bond issued by TransCentury Mauritius Holdings, a unit of the
company, the Nairobi-based newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
