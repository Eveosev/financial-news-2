The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority,
one of the world’s three largest sovereign wealth funds, is
restructuring its external equities teams into two sections, one
focused on indexed funds and the other on those that are
actively managed.  The reorganization aims to streamline relationships with
external fund managers and help pool information within the
organization, a spokesman for ADIA said, speaking on condition
of anonymity in line with company policy. Previously, the fund
was organized into four divisions based on geographic lines.  Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa Al Nahyan, son of the United
Arab Emirates’ president, will head the indexed funds
department, while Obeid Al-Suwaidi, formerly director of
external funds  Far East , will lead actively managed external
funds.  ADIA had assets valued at $328 billion at the end of 2008,
according to economists at the New York-based Council on Foreign
Relations. ADIA and its Norwegian and Chinese peers are the
three largest sovereign wealth funds in the world managing over
$1 trillion between them, London-based research firm Preqin Ltd.
said in March 2010. Abu Dhabi, the biggest of seven emirates in
the U.A.E., set up ADIA in 1976 to manage proceeds from its oil
wealth. The emirate has about 7 percent of the world’s proven
oil reserves.  The fund has stakes in companies including Hyatt Hotels
Corp., Saudi Arabia’s Kingdom Holding and London’s Gatwick
Airport Ltd.  To contact the reporter on this story:
