South Africa , the biggest corn
producer on the continent, will probably cut its forecast for
this seasonâ€™s harvest, a survey showed.  The country may say farmers will reap 10.4 million metric
tons of corn compared with the 10.85 million metric tons
estimated in July, according to the median estimate of 12
traders Bloomberg surveyed. Forecasts ranged from 10.1 million
to 10.75 million tons.  The  Crop Estimates Committee  will issue a seventh
assessment of the crop on Aug. 25 at 3:30 p.m. in Johannesburg.  White corn for December delivery, the most active contract
on the South African Futures Exchange, rose 3.6 percent to 2,200
rand ($306) a ton by the midday close today. Yellow corn for
September delivery gained 3.3 percent, to 2,168 rand a ton.  To contact the reporter on this story:
