Mexico  may receive as much as $20
billion in foreign direct investment this year, 11 percent more
than a prior forecast, as the second-biggest Latin American
economy’s low wages and proximity to the U.S. draw producers.  “Companies are looking for the best place to invest,”
Economy Minister Bruno Ferrari said in an Aug. 19 interview in
Los Angeles. “It’s obvious that Mexico has been that place for
 North America .”  Mexico has manufacturing costs 25 percent lower than the
U.S., is producing more engineers than other countries and is
signing free trade pacts with nations like  Colombia , Ferrari
said. The expected $20 billion compares to $18 billion estimated
earlier this year by Finance Minister  Ernesto Cordero .  Mexican economists  have also boosted their forecast for
FDI, as the foreign investment is known, in the most recent
central bank survey Aug. 1, saying the that country may get
$19.7 billion this year compared with $19.5 billion in July.  In the past year, Mexico has attracted auto manufacturers
like  Volkswagen AG (VOW) , Nissan Motor Co., Mazda Motor Co. and
 General Motors Co. (GM)  to announce investments in the country of
more than $400 million each.  Honda Motor Co.,  Japan ’s third-largest automaker, said on
Aug. 12 it plans to build an $800 million factory in the central
Mexican city of Celaya.  “We’re expecting to have more of those announcements
before the year’s end,” Ferrari said, declining to identify the
auto manufacturers that may open factories in Mexico.  Automotive Investments  The  auto industry , including the production of auto parts,
generated $64.9 billion in exports last year, according to a
report by Citigroup Inc.’s Banamex unit. This surpasses the
$41.7 billion received from crude and oil derivatives, the $21.3
billion from remittances and the $11.9 billion from tourism,
Banamex data show.  Including portfolio investments, Mexico will get more than
$40 billion this year, Deputy Finance Minister  Gerardo Rodriguez 
said Aug. 10.  Mexican peso bonds are posting the biggest rally in Latin
America on speculation slowing economic growth will keep
inflation near a five-year low and prompt the central bank to
cut  interest rates .  The yield on Mexico’s benchmark notes due in 2024 sank 95
basis points, or 0.95 percentage point, in the past month to a
record 6.03 percent Aug. 18, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Yields on similar-maturity Colombian peso bonds slid
41 basis points, while those on  Brazil ’s benchmark local
securities maturing in 2021 dropped 77 basis points.  “We have been managing our finances in a very responsible
way,” said Ferrari, who has been the head of the Economy
Ministry since July 2010.  Slower Growth  Mexico’s IPC index fell 0.3 percent to 33,136.89 on Aug. 19
and has lost 14 percent so far this year.  Latin America  and Caribbean countries received $159 billion
in FDI last year, according to the World Investment Report 2011
by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.  Remittances have grown about 4 percent to 5 percent in the
first five months this year and the government expects at least
a similar amount to last year’s $21.2 billion, Ferrari said.  Mexico’s economy grew 3.3 percent in the second quarter
from a year earlier, the slowest pace since the last three
months of 2009, as agriculture and mining contracted.  Growth eased from  4.6 percent  in the first quarter, the
national statistics agency said Aug. 19 on its  website . The
median estimate of 19 economists surveyed by Bloomberg was for
the economy to expand 3.6 percent.  Ferrari said the government still expects growth this year
between 4 percent and 5 percent, slowing to between 3 percent
and 4.5 percent in 2012.  The 26 consulting economic firms surveyed by the central
bank cut their 2011 growth forecast for second consecutive
month. The analysts now expect the economy to expand 4.24
percent compare with 4.31 percent in the July 1 monthly survey.  To contact the reporters on this story:
