Gold’s rally to a record above
$1,900 an ounce has pushed the metal to overbought levels
according to technical analysis tools, as economist  Dennis
Gartman  said prices will go “parabolic.”  Bullion’s relative strength index has topped 70 since Aug.
5, a signal to some investors who study technical charts that
prices may be set to decline. Gold hugged its upper Bollinger
band most of this month, which may signal possible resistance,
while a moving average convergence/divergence indicator and
Elliot Wave patterns suggest prices are overextended, said Ross Norman, chief executive officer of London bullion brokerage
Sharps Pixley Ltd.  Gold futures climbed as high as $1,904 an ounce in New York
today and is up 16 percent in August, set for the best monthly
gain since 1999. The metal has advanced as concern about debt
crises and slower economic growth spurred investors to diversify
holdings away from equities and some currencies. The biggest
gold-backed exchange-traded product surpassed its equities
counterpart as the largest by market value, while bullion rose
to record prices in euros, British pounds and Swiss francs.  Set to Drop?  “I think we’re overextended in the short term,”  Axel Rudolph , a technical strategist at Commerzbank AG in London,
said by phone. “I wouldn’t be surprised if we were to fail
around $1,900 to $1,922 and retrace a little bit for a few days
or so. It’s still very bullish longer term. Longer term, I think
$2,000 will definitely be hit.”  Prices may slip to the Aug. 11 high of about $1,815 if gold
stays below $1,925, which is near a 60-minute point-and-figure
target, Rudolph said. The metal may move “sideways to up” if
no decline takes place in the next couple of days, he said.  Still, a weekly close above $1,900 may push prices to the
“psychological” level of $2,000, near the 200 percent
extension of the rally from January’s low to May’s high
projected from the May low, one of the levels singled out in so-
called Fibonacci analysis, he said. Fibonacci analysis is based
on the theory that prices tend to drop or climb by certain
percentages after reaching a high or low.  Since 1920  Gold futures for December delivery traded at $1,901.90 at
5:15 p.m. on the Comex in  New York . In London, bullion for
immediate delivery gained 2.5 percent as of 10:17 p.m., after
reaching $1,900.60. It’s up 34 percent this year and heading for
an 11th straight annual gain, the longest winning streak since
at least 1920. The metal has outperformed global equities,
commodities and Treasuries this year.  “Gold is strong in any and all currency terms, and it is
now entering that stage when prices go parabolic,” Gartman said
today in his Suffolk, Virginia-based Gartman Letter. “This will
end when it ends; there is really nothing more that can or shall
or should be said.”  Speculative demand from investors has pushed the gold
market into a “bubble that is poised to burst,”  Wells Fargo &
Co . said in an Aug. 15 report. Prices may climb to $2,000 an
ounce by the end of the year, according to the median forecast
in a Bloomberg survey of 13 traders and analysts at a conference
in Kovalam in South India on Aug. 20.  ‘Panic Phase’  The precious metal’s “rally when by rights a period of
consolidation or profit-taking would be expected suggests that
gold is either simply not in technical ‘mode’ and that other
external factors are driving us higher, or that we are in a
panic phase which inevitably leads to a blow-off at the top,”
Sharps Pixley’s Norman said.  Demand for gold pushed holdings in ETPs to a record 2,216.8
metric tons on Aug. 8, data compiled by Bloomberg show.
Investors’ assets in the products were 2,211.1 tons on Aug. 19,
more than all but four central banks. Central banks are also
adding to gold reserves for the first time in a generation.  The market capitalization of the SPDR Gold Trust, the
biggest gold-backed ETP, rose to $76.7 billion on Aug. 19,
according to the most recent data compiled by Bloomberg. SPDR
S&P 500 ETF Trust, which had been the industry’s largest ETP
since 1993, was at $74.4 billion.  Bullion’s 14-day RSI, last at 83.61, reached 84.96 on Aug.
10, the highest level since October, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. Prices fell as much as 7.3 percent in the week
after the gauge was at 84.61 on April 29 and traded in a $115
range for the next 2 1/2 months.  “You can actually make forecasts, even if it’s trading at
new all-time highs,” Commerzbank’s Rudolph said. “The problem
with gold right now is that in the last three days it’s just
accelerated higher, and when it’s in this sort of move, it can
still continue in fast spikes. It’s very difficult to know where
the spikes are going to end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
