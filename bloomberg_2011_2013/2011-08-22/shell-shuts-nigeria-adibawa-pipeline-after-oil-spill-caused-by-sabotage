Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) ’s Nigerian
unit said it shut the Adibawa pipeline in the southern oil
producing region after saboteurs cut the link with “hacksaws,”
causing spills.  Shell has begun repair works on the pipeline located in the
oil-rich Bayelsa state, according to a statement e-mailed by the
company today from Lagos, the country’s commercial capital. Six
crude spills were recorded from Aug. 2 to Aug. 15 along a 33
kilometer (21 miles) stretch of the Okordia-Rumuekpe link at
Ikarama state, which were fixed on Aug. 20, the company said.  Attacks by armed groups targeting the oil industry cut more
than 28 percent of the country’s crude output from 2006 to 2009,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Attacks subsided after
thousands of militants campaigning for more local control of the
delta’s energy resources accepted a government amnesty and
disarmed in 2009.  Nigeria is  Africa ’s largest oil producer and the fifth-
biggest source of U.S. imports. Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon
Mobil Corp., Chevron Corp., Total SA and Eni SpA run joint
ventures with the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Corp.
