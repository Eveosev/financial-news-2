Pork stockpiles in the U.S. rose
16 percent at the end of July from a year earlier, the
government said, as production increased and higher prices
curbed demand.  Warehouses held 453.9 million pounds of the meat on July
31, up from 391.2 million a year earlier, the  U.S. Department
of Agriculture  said today in a report. Inventories fell 8.3
percent from the end of June. On Aug. 8, wholesale pork
reached $1.1019 a pound, the highest since at least October
1997, USDA data show. High prices pushed shoppers toward
cheaper meats, said  Dan Vaught , the owner of Vaught Futures
Insights in Altus,  Arkansas .  “We’ve seen some production increases earlier this
year,” Vaught said in a telephone interview before the
report. There has also been some “carryover” from earlier
jumps in inventories, he said.  Hog futures for October settlement rose 0.375 cent, or
0.4 percent, to 88.75 cents a pound at 12:49 p.m. on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Before today, the price gained 11
percent this year.  Pork production in the first six months of this year
totaled 11.09 billion pounds, up 1.7 percent from the same
period in 2010, government  data  show.  As of July 31, stockpiles of  pork bellies , which are
cured and sliced to make bacon, surged 38 percent from a year
earlier to 29.5 million pounds, according to today’s report.
Warehouse supplies of ham rose 9.5 percent to 134.7 million
pounds.  Chicken-meat inventories at the end of July were 14
percent larger than a year earlier at 764.4 million pounds,
the USDA said. Beef supplies rose 7.5 percent to 418.1 million
pounds.  To contact the reporter on this story:
