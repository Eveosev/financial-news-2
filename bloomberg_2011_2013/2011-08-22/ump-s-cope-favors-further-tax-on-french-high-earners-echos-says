The parliamentary head of Nicolas
Sarkozy’s ruling Union for a Popular Movement party is in favor
of a one-time tax on French high earners to help cut debt,  Les
Echos  reported, citing an interview.  “Things are sufficiently serious to call on everyone to
help,” Jean-Francois Cope said, according to the newspaper, in
an interview to be published tomorrow. “But let there be no
ambiguity about this, that’s not what’s going to solve the
country’s debt” problem.  Cope said further cuts in the 1 trillion euros of French
public spending are necessary. “We can’t afford the luxury of
not looking at savings,” he said, according to Les Echos.  To contact the reporter on this story:
