Manchester United , the record 19-
time English soccer champion, agreed on a four-year contract
worth about 40 million pounds ($66 million) for delivery company
DHL to sponsor its training apparel, according to two people
familiar with the deal.  The contract is the first time any Premier League club has
sold rights to sponsor only its training wear. The agreement is
worth about half the 80 million pounds the team receives from
principal sponsor Aon Corp., said one of the people, who
declined to be identified because the accord hasn’t been
officially announced.  United declined to comment on the report. DHL, controlled
by  Deutsche Post AG (DPW) , wasn’t able to comment immediately.  The plan comes as the Premier League team plans an initial
public offering in  Singapore  to raise $1 billion later this
year, three people familiar with the IPO plans said last week. A
stake of up to 30 percent may be sold, said one of the people.  Thanks to a series of sponsorship deals in recent years the
team’s commercial revenue has surged to about 100 million pounds
a year, bringing that part of the business in line with income
from television and matches at United’s Old Trafford Stadium.  The club also plans to announce next month a sponsorship
deal with Malaysian snack-maker  Mamee Double Decker Bhd. (MAMEE) ’s
Mister Potato brand, said three people familiar with the matter.  To contact the reporter for this story:
