Mexico ’s peso declined to the
weakest level in more than a week as concern grew that the
global economy is struggling to recover.  The peso fell 0.5 percent to 12.3571 per  U.S. dollar , the
lowest since Aug. 10, at 5 p.m. New York time, from 12.2980 on
Aug. 19.  “The peso has been very subject to international
volatility,” said  Rafael Camarena , an economist at Banco
Santander SA in Mexico City. “The  Mexican peso  is moving more
on the external events than on the local economy.”  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. cut its forecast for growth in the
U.S. to 1.5 percent from 1.7 percent on signs the recovery in
the world’s largest economy has lost steam. The U.S. purchases
about 80 percent of Mexico’s exports.  The yield on Mexico’s peso bonds due in 2024 rose 2 basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 6.09 percent, according to
Banco Santander SA. The price of the security fell 0.18 centavo
to 135.58 centavos per peso.  Traders didn’t trigger any of the dollar options available
today, the central bank said on its website. The bank has been
buying as much as $600 million through the options every month
since March 2010 to bolster foreign reserves. They allow the
central bank to accumulate dollars, insuring against outflows of
capital and limiting the peso’s appreciation.  To contact the reporter on this story:
