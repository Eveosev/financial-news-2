Alpha Natural Resources Inc. (ANR) , the
third-largest U.S. coal producer, approved a plan to buy back as
much as $600 million of its shares after they declined 40
percent in the past month.  The plan expires at the end of 2014, the company said today
in a statement. About $17 million of a $125 million buyback
program announced in May 2010 is also still available, Abington,
Virginia-based Alpha said.  Alpha, which completed its acquisition of Massey Energy Co.
for $7.1 billion in June, rose 44 cents, or 1.6 percent, to
$28.80 as of 5 p.m. after the close of regular trading on the
New York Stock Exchange. The shares have declined 53 percent
this year through today’s close, the ninth-largest drop on the
Standard & Poor’s 500 Index.  Peabody Energy Corp is the biggest U.S. coal producer
ranked by market capitalization, followed by Consol Energy Inc.  To contact the reporter on this story:
