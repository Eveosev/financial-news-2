Libya  may be able to export as much
as 1.2 million barrels of oil a day, equal to between one and
two tanker cargoes, within the next 12 months, according to IHS
Energy.  The North African country may be able to ship 250,000 to
300,000 barrels a day within three months if stability returns
and foreign employees resume working,  Samuel Ciszuk , senior
Middle East and North Africa analyst at IHS Energy, said today
by phone from  London . An aframax tanker can haul as much as
690,000 barrels, according to Poten & Partners, a New York-based
consultancy.  Exports of Libya’s light, sweet crude slumped as rebels
battled  Muammar Qaddafi . The  International Energy Agency  in June
announced the release of 60 million barrels of oil from member
nations’ emergency stockpiles as the fighting pared global
supplies. Today rebels said Qaddafi’s 42-year rule “is over”
as opposition fighters engaged pockets of loyalist troops near
the presidential compound in southern Tripoli and in the center
of the capital.  Brent crude  for October settlement dropped 94 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $107.68 a barrel by 5:50 p.m. in London on ICE
Futures Europe exchange. Prices are up 14 percent this year.  “They were exporting 1.5 to 1.6 million barrels a day
before the civil war, so in a best-case scenario, they could
increase to an export of 1.1 to 1.2 million barrels a day, but
everything will have to work out politically, and that is the
big question mark,” said Ciszuk. Reports of looting and
possible damage to older oilfields that had been shut down
quickly may slow the return to production, he suggested.  Lower Rates  Charter rates for aframaxes on the trans-Mediterranean
route have plunged 51 percent from this year’s peak on March 2,
based on data from the  Baltic Exchange . Today they rose 2.4
percent to 95.42 Worldscale points.  Worldscale points are a percentage of a nominal rate, or
flat rate, for more than 320,000 specific routes. Flat rates for
every voyage, quoted in U.S. dollars a ton, are revised annually
by the Worldscale Association in London to reflect changing fuel
costs, port tariffs and exchange rates.  To contact the reporter on this story:
