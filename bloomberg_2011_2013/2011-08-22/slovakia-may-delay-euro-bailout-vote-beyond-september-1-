Slovak Prime Minister  Iveta Radicova 
said she wants the country to be the last euro-region member to
vote on changes to the bloc’s bailout mechanism, possibly
delaying a decision beyond September.  The eastern European country is delaying a parliamentary
vote after Radicova’s administration failed to secure majority
support for the proposals, which include creating a permanent
bailout mechanism and strengthening the temporary European
Financial Stability Facility fund.  “We will use the time to continue negotiations,” Radicova
told journalists in the Slovak capital Bratislava today, after
meeting with her coalition partners. When asked whether the
government has dropped its original plan to submit the necessary
legislation to parliament in September, she said it would be
“irresponsible” to talk about any deadline.  European leaders agreed at a July 21 summit to revamp the
euro region’s bailout mechanism after the sovereign-debt crisis
threatened to spread to Spain and  Italy . The agreement must be
ratified by all 17 countries that share the euro.  Freedom and Solidarity, one of Slovakia’s four ruling
parties, still opposes the revamp, Chairman Richard Sulik said
today after meeting with Radicova. He told reporters he hopes
the plan is rejected by another country first.  To contact the reporter on this story:
