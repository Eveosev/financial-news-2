Chilean stocks are “very
attractive” and the benchmark index is poised for a rebound
after dropping 16 percent this year, said Tomas Langlois, who
manages the country’s second-best performing equity fund.  “At current prices,  Chile  is at one of the most attractive
entry points of the last two years,” Langlois, who manages
Santiago-based brokerage Larrain Vial SA Administradora General
de Fondos’s Beagle fund, said in an interview.  The Beagle fund returned 82 percent in 2010 and 21 percent
in the last three years, making it the second-best fund in Chile
in the period after Larrain Vial’s Precision mutual fund,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The Beagle fund has
retreated 10.6 percent this year.  The Ipsa index trades at 15.6 times reported earnings, the
lowest since May 2009. The gauge will rise 10 percent by year-
end, driven by strong consumer demand even as the economy shows
some signs of deceleration, Langlois said. Chile’s economy
expanded at 10 percent in the first quarter and 6.8 percent in
the second, according to according to data from the central
bank.  Langlois prefers medical stocks such as  Banmedica SA (BANMED) , a
health services provider and insurer, and clinic operators
Instituto de Diagnostico SA and  Clinica Las Condes SA. (CONDES)  He
declined to say if he has recently bought these stocks, citing
company policy.  “The health sector is a defensive play,” he said. “It’s
growing, and there is scarcity in local public sector offer.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
