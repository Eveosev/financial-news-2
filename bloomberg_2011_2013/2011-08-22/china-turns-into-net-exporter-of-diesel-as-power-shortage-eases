China , the world’s second-largest
oil user, became a net diesel exporter last month after power
shortages eased, reducing demand for the fuel burned in small
generation units, government data showed.  Net exports of the fuel used in machinery and power
generation were at 20,000 metric tons last month after imports
fell 53 percent to 160,000 tons in July from June, according to
data from the General Administration of Customs today. China’s
diesel imports exceeded exports for the first time in five
months in June, with net purchases of 140,000 tons.  Electricity supply rationing was reduced to 12 Chinese
provinces in mid-July after rainfall boosted hydropower
generation and lowered summer temperatures, the National
Development and Reform Commission, the nation’s top economic
planner, said July 29.  The country was a net exporter of the fuel in the first
seven months after overseas purchases jumped 34 percent to 1.19
million tons and exports fell 58 percent to 1.29 million tons.  Oil-product inventories dropped 5.5 percent at the end of
July from June after domestic refineries shut units for seasonal
maintenance and summer demand increased, China Oil, Gas &
Petrochemicals, a newsletter published by the official Xinhua
News Agency, said today.  Diesel inventories fell 5.4 percent to 9.53 million tons in
July, the lowest since January, and gasoline stockpiles declined
5 percent to 5.99 million tons, the least since at least January
2010, according to Bloomberg calculation based on China OGP
data.  Net exports of gasoline slipped to 300,000 tons in July
from 320,000 tons in June and 319,986 tons a year earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
