Ukrainian billionaire Rinat Akhmetov’s steelmaker Metinvest appointed Serhiy Melnyk to
replace Pavlo Moiseenko as director of the Sukhodilska-Skhidna
coal mine, where an explosion killed 27 workers last month.  “The new director’s main task will be to ensure the
strictest adherence to work safety rules,” Oleksandr Potapenko,
chief executive officer of  VAT Krasnodonvuhillya , said in a
 statement  on the company’s website today. Krasnodonvuhillya, the
country’s second-largest miner and operator of Sukhodilska-
Skhidna, is a unit of Metinvest, the country’s biggest
steelmaker.  The government, which controls mines accounting for about
half the nation’s coal output, is seeking to lure investments to
upgrade working facilities and make production more efficient.
Ukraine is  Europe ’s third-biggest supplier of coal after Russia
and  Poland .  A blast on July 29 killed 27 miners in the Sukhodilska-
Skhidna mine at Lugansk, 810 kilometers (503 miles) southeast of
the capital, Kiev, in the deadliest such accident since 2007.  To contact the reporter son this story:
