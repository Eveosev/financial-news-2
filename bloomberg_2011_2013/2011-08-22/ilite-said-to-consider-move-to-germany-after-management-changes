(Corrects spelling of name of acting chairman in last
paragraph.)  Hilite International Inc., a U.S.
maker of engine and clutch equipment, is considering relocating
to Germany from Ohio and is seeking new management to expand
through acquisitions, two people with knowledge of the matter
said.  Hilite, which agreed to be purchased by U.K. buyout firm  3i
Group Plc (III)  in May, has parted ways with Chief Executive Officer
Joseph Carreras and Finance Chief Michael Kestner, said the
people, who asked not to be identified because the information
is private.  3i will likely focus the company on growth and may make
acquisitions to help boost Hilite’s annual revenue of $400
million, the people said. The Cleveland-based company, which
generates 70 percent of sales in Germany, bought  Siemens AG (SIE) ’s
Hydraulik-Ring unit in 2002, acquiring operations in four German
locations.  3i, which bought Hilite in an all equity transaction, is
likely to seek external financing as Hilite is almost debt free,
the people said. The engine-parts maker, whose products help
enhance  fuel efficiency  and reduce emissions, has its German
headquarters in Marktheidenfeld in the state of Bavaria.  Axel Cordes, a spokesman for 3i, declined to comment on a
possible move of Hilite’s headquarters to  Germany . He confirmed
that Carreras left in July and that the company has hired Craig
Stinson as acting chairman and CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
