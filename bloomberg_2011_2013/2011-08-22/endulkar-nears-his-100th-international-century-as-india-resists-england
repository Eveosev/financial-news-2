Sachin Tendulkar  fell nine runs
short of his record 100th international century after he led
Indiaâ€™s resistance today on the final day of the fourth cricket
Test against England.  Tendulkar was trapped leg-before-wicket by Tim Bresnan for
91, soon after Amit Mishra was bowled by Graeme Swann for 84
at the Oval in London.  The visitors, following on, had reached 262-5 by 2:30 p.m.
in their second innings, still needing 29 runs to make England
bat again. England failed to take a wicket this morning after
India resumed on 129-3.  England totaled 591-6 declared in its first innings,
including a career-best 235 from Ian Bell and 175 from  Kevin Pietersen . India was all out for 300, including 146 not out by
 Rahul Dravid .  England leads the four-match series 3-0 and has guaranteed
its place as the No. 1 team in the International Cricket Council
Test rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
