Hong Kong  may report today that
inflation accelerated past 8 percent last month, the fastest
pace since 1995.  Prices rose 8.2 percent from a year earlier, according to
the median estimate of 13 economists in a Bloomberg News survey.
That would compare with a 5.6 percent gain in June. The latest
number will be distorted by a waiver of public housing rentals
in July 2010 that wasn’t repeated in the same month this year,
according to Standard Chartered Plc.  Asian nations are grappling with inflation pressures even
as slumping equity markets add to the likelihood of weaker
global growth and reduced demand for exports. In Hong Kong, the
economy will probably shrink this quarter after already
contracting in the previous three months, according to Morgan
Stanley and Daiwa Capital Markets.  “Underlying inflationary pressure is still on the rise,”
said Kelvin Lau, an economist at  Standard Chartered  in Hong
Kong. Excluding the effect of the waiver, inflation would likely
have been less than 6 percent last month, Lau said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
