Standard Group Ltd. (STNG) ,  Kenya ’s second-
biggest media company, said first-half profit climbed 6.5
percent as revenue increased and announced the appointment of a
new chief executive officer.  Income before tax rose to 230 million shillings ($2.49
million) in the six months through June, from 216 million
shillings a year earlier, the Nairobi-based company said in a
statement e-mailed by the city’s stock exchange today. It didn’t
give a profit-after-tax figure. Sales grew 5.9 percent to 1.63
billion shillings, it said.  “The board remains cautiously optimistic that barring
significant weakening of the Kenyan shilling and its impact on
the cost of production, the group will maintain its growth
prospects,” the company said. The shilling has fallen 13
percent against the dollar so far this year.  Standard said it appointed Paul Melly, former chief
strategist at the company, as CEO. Melly also remains group
deputy chairman, according to a separate statement e-mailed by
the stock exchange today. No one at Standard’s offices answered
calls seeking comment.  Shares of Standard Group surged 8.1 percent to 33.50
shillings as of the 3:00 p.m. close in Nairobi, the highest
level since July 12. The stock has fallen 26.4 percent this
year, underperforming a 20 percent decline in the benchmark NSE-
20 Share Index over the same period, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
