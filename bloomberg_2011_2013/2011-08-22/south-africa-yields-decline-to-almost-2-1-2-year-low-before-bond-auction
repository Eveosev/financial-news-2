South African 15-year government
bond yields fell to the lowest in almost 2 1/2 years before
tomorrow’s auction of the debt as signs of slowing global growth
boost demand for fixed-income securities.  The Pretoria-based  Reserve Bank  is selling 1.1 billion rand
of the 10.5 percent notes due 2026 and 1 billion rand of 6.25
percent bonds due 2036. The secondary-market yield on the 2026
bonds dropped as much as 17 basis points, or 0.17 percentage
point, to 7.70 percent today, the lowest since January 2009. The
notes yielded 7.85 percent as of 2:34 p.m. in Johannesburg.  Global stocks have tumbled and U.S. Treasury yields are at
record lows as speculation of a third round of Federal Reserve
bond purchases fails to dent concern the world’s biggest economy
is slowing. Gold rallied for a sixth day to a record on concern
German  Chancellor Angela Merkel ’s resistance to common euro-area
bonds will prolong the region’s debt crisis.  “It looks as if the current bond-strength environment is
set to continue given the massive pressure equity markets are
under,” Rand Merchant Bank analysts led by Theuns de Wet wrote
in a research note. “The market is starting to look at the
prospect of a rate cut locally,” which would boost bonds, they
wrote.  South Africa ’s economy expanded an annualized 4.8 percent
in the first quarter, the fastest pace in a year, from 4.5
percent in the final three months of last year, the government
statistics agency said on May 31.  Since then most economic data has pointed to a slowdown,
with the joblessness rate rising to 25.7 percent in the second
quarter, from 25 percent in the previous three months, and
manufacturing growth slowing to 0.9 percent in June, from a
revised 1 percent the month before. Retail sales rose 2.2
percent in June, below the average sales growth in the first
quarter.  Tomorrow’s auction starts at 11 a.m., and the results will
be announced at about 11:30 a.m., the Reserve Bank said on
Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
