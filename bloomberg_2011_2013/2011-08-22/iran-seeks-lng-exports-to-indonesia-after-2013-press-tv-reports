Iran  is in talks with an Indonesian
company to export 1.5 million tons of liquefied natural gas
annually to the Southeast Asian country,  Press TV  reported,
citing an Iranian energy official.  Iran would start supplying  Indonesia  after 2013 and
completion of the arrangements, Ali Kheir-Andish, managing
director of Iran Liquefied Natural Gas Co., said in a report
published by the state-run satellite news channel today. Kheir-
Andish didn’t identify the Indonesian company.  Iran intended to start exporting LNG at least five years
ago. Kheir-Andish said on April 10 that Iran LNG, the country’s
maiden LNG project, is poised to begin exporting by the end of
next year after tapping domestic funds to beat international
sanctions over the country’s nuclear program.  To contact the reporter on this story:
