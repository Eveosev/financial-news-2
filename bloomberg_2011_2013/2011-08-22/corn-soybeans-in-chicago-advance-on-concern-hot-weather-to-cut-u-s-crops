Wheat rose to a two-month high in
 Chicago  on speculation a drought in the U.S. will cut the amount
of winter plants seeded this year.  Little or no rain  has fallen in parts of the U.S. southern
Plains this year, National Weather Service data show. Dry, hot
weather will persist in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas, the largest
U.S. producers of winter wheat, in the next week, Telvent DTN
said. Spring-wheat growers may have been unable to plant 2.92
million acres this year because of wet weather, U.S. Department
of Agriculture data show.  “The disappointing U.S. spring-wheat crop and feared
delays to winter-wheat planting in the Great Plains because of
drought are the top issues on the U.S. wheat market at
present,”  Carsten Fritsch , an analyst at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , said in a report today.  Wheat for December delivery gained 11.5 cents, or 1.5
percent, to $7.7275 a bushel by 1:15 p.m.  London  time on the
Chicago Board of Trade. The grain touched $7.73, the highest
price since June 14. Milling wheat for November delivery traded
on NYSE Liffe in Paris rose 2.25 euros, or 1.1 percent, to 204
euros ($294) a metric ton.  Corn and soybeans advanced for a second day on concern a
week-long crop survey will show signs of declining yields in the
U.S., curbing supply from the top global exporter of both crops.  Professional Farmers of America will begin deploying
analysts, grain traders, buyers and farmers today as scouts to
survey 2,000 fields in seven states. That tour will uncover
evidence of diminished output after the hottest July since 1955
stunted Midwest crop growth, according to  Roy Huckabay , an
executive vice president at commodity broker Linn Group.  Corn for December delivery rose 8.75 cents, or 1.2 percent,
to $7.34 a bushel in Chicago. November-delivery soybeans gained
13.75 cents, or 1 percent, to $13.8225 a bushel.  To contact the reporters on this story:
