Russia urges against outside
interference in  Libya  after rebels swept into Tripoli, the
Foreign Ministry said.  The “dramatic turn of events in the Libyan conflict”
signals an “imminent transfer of power into the hands of rebel
forces” and may end the crisis in the North African nation, the
ministry said in a  statement  on its website today.  Russia may recognize the opposition National Transitional
Council after Libyan leader  Muammar Qaddafi  resigns, Konstantin Kosachyov, head of the lower house of parliament’s international
affairs committee, told Russian state television broadcaster RT.  To contact the reporter on this story:
