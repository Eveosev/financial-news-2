U.S. futures rose amid speculation
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to signal as soon as
this week that the central bank will begin a third round of
asset purchases to boost the economy.  Standard & Poorâ€™s 500 futures expiring in September rose
0.6 percent to 1,130.6 as of 8:46 p.m. in  London . The contract
earlier fell as much as 1 percent.  Record-low yields on U.S. Treasuries show traders expect
the Fed to signal a third round of asset purchases.  Barclays Plc said 10-year yields indicate traders have
priced in $500 billion to $600 billion of Treasury purchases by
the Fed. Citigroup Inc. said current rates can only be justified
by more central bank bond buying or assuming the economy will
shrink by 2 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
