Brazil ’s real gained on speculation
the  Federal Reserve  will unveil further measures to support the
U.S. economy, boosting demand for higher-yielding assets.  The real advanced 0.4 percent to 1.5938 per dollar at 8:53
a.m. New York time, from 1.5996 on Aug. 19.  U.S. stock futures rose as traders bet Federal Reserve
Chairman Ben S. Bernanke will begin a third round of asset
purchases to bolster the U.S. economy. The Fed is holding its
annual symposium in  Jackson Hole , Wyoming, this weekend. This
time last year Chairman Ben S. Bernanke hinted that the central
bank might embark on a second round of asset purchases, kicking
off a 28 percent rally in the  S&P 500  that ended in a three-year
high on April 29.  Another round of asset purchases by the Fed would drive
real appreciation by causing “a weakening dollar and a rise in
commodities,” said Alfredo Barbutti, an economist at Liquidez
DTVM Ltda in Sao Paulo.  The yield on the Brazilian interest-rate futures contract
due in January 2013 rose four basis points, or 0.04 percentage
point, to 11.5 percent.  To contact the reporters on this story:
