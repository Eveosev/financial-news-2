(Corrects story published yesterday to fix trader’s title
in third paragraph.)  Chile’s peso rose for a second day
as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will unveil more measures to
support the  U.S. economy  spurred demand for riskier emerging-
market assets.  The peso rose 0.2 percent to 467.67 per  U.S. dollar  at 1:08
p.m. New York time, from 468.39 on Aug. 19. The peso gained 0.5
percent last week.  “All eyes are on the international scenario,” Eugenio Cortes, head of currency forwards at EuroAmerica Corredores de
Bolsa SA, said in a telephone interview. The peso has remained
within a band between 465 and 475 per U.S. dollar and should
trend toward the stronger part of the band, he said.  The Fed is holding its annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,
Wyoming, this weekend. Last year, Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke 
hinted that the central bank might embark on a second round of
asset purchases, kicking off a 28 percent rally in the Standard
& Poor’s 500 Index that ended in a three-year high on April 29.  Chile’s one-year interest-rate swap rate, which reflects
traders’ view of future rates, rose eight basis points, or 0.08
percentage point, to 4.84 percent, the largest gain in more than
a week. The contract is trading below the three-month swap rate,
suggesting traders are betting that the central bank will lower
its benchmark rate from 5.25 percent.  The central bank held its rate at 5.25 percent for the
second straight month at an Aug. 18 meeting after inflation and
economic growth slowed.  To contact the reporter on this story:
