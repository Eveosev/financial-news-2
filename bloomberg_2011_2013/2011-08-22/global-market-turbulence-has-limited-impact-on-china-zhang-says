The global financial turmoil will
have a “psychological” impact on  China ’s markets while the
effect on the real economy will be limited, Zhang Yansheng, a
researcher affiliated with the National Development and Reform
Commission, said in an interview today.  Weaker U.S. data, and the subsequent plunge in equity
markets around the world last week will drag down Chinese stocks,
said Zhang, who works for the Institute of Foreign Economic
Research. “Fragile sentiment is spreading, and that’s the main
problem, whereas the impact on China’s real economy will be
limited,” he said.  Faltering U.S. growth and a failure to resolve  Europe ’s
debt crisis are weighing on the confidence of investors,
consumers and businesses. China’s benchmark stock index fell for
a fifth day today on concern the government will further tighten
monetary policy even as the global economic slowdown threatens
to curb Chinese exports.  “ China’s economy  is mainly driven by domestic demand,”
Zhang said. “Should demand from the U.S. and Europe fall,
regional growth along China’s eastern coast in areas such as
Guangdong, will take a hit but not the overall economy.”  --Li Yanping. Editors: Nerys Avery  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
