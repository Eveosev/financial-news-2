The Pentagon is likely to release
this week its unclassified assessment of  China ’s military
capability, a report that was due by law last March, according
to a senior defense official who wasn’t authorized to discuss
the matter publicly.  The annual report also will include an assessment of
China’s military balance against  Taiwan . The fiscal 2000 defense
act mandated the report be submitted each year no later than
March 1. Last year’s version wasn’t released until Aug. 16.  “This annual report provides vital information to Congress
on China’s intentions and capabilities,” Representation Randy
Forbes, a Virginia Republican and chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee readiness panel, who noted in an e-mail today
that the report was “175 days overdue.”  Forbes, a co-founder of the Congressional China Caucus,
wrote Defense Secretary Leon Panetta  today  complaining about
delay in the report’s release.  Last year’s report said China is pursuing a military
capability to reach as far as the  Indian Ocean  and the western
Pacific, even while it maintains its military buildup opposite
Taiwan amid improved economic ties across the strait.  To contact the reporter on this story:
