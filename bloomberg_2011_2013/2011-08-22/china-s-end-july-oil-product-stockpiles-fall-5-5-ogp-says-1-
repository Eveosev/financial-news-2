China ’s oil-product inventories fell
5.5 percent as of the end of July from June after domestic
refineries shut units for seasonal maintenance and summer demand
increased in the world’s fastest-growing major economy.  Stockpiles of gasoline declined 5 percent to 5.99 million
metric tons, diesel dropped 5.4 percent to 9.53 million tons and
kerosene shrank 7.6 percent to 1.47 million tons, according to
Bloomberg calculations based on today’s figures in China Oil,
Gas & Petrochemicals, a newsletter published by the official
Xinhua News Agency. Crude inventories rose 3.3 percent to 29.56
million tons.  PetroChina Co. and  China Petroleum & Chemical Corp. (600028) , the
nation’s largest refiners, suspended oil-product purchases from
privately run plants last month, which also led to a drop in
stockpiles, China OGP said.  The country’s oil-product consumption growth remained
steady in July, the newsletter said, without elaborating.  --Winnie Zhu, Yee Kai Pin. Editors: Ryan Woo,  Mike Anderson .  To contact the reporter on this story:
