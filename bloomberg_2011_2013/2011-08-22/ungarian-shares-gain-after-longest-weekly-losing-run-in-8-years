Hungarian shares advanced,
rebounding after capping the seventh week of losses last week,
the longest such streak since 2003, on speculation the  Federal
Reserve  may signal additional measures to stimulate the economy.  The benchmark BUX index of shares rose 1.3 percent to
18,012.49 by 11:45 a.m. in Budapest. Gedeon Richter Nyrt., the
country’s biggest drugmaker, rallied 2.3 percent to 35,815
forint. The Hungarian currency weakened 0.5 percent to 273.7 per
euro and 0.3 percent to 241.262 against the Swiss franc.  Central bankers from around the world will meet in  Jackson
Hole , Wyoming, this week amid record-low yields on U.S.
Treasuries that show traders expect Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben
S. Bernanke  to signal a third round of asset purchases, known as
quantitative easing, to boost the faltering recovery.  “The market is already starting to price in a $500-billion
QE3 ahead of Bernanke’s speech on Friday,” Akos Herczenik and
Levente Blaho, analysts at Raiffeisen Bank International AG in
Budapest, wrote in a research note today. Speculation over the
Fed’s planned action may dominate equities markets this week,
the Raiffeisen analysts added.  OTP Bank Nyrt.,  Hungary ’s biggest lender, jumped 2.1
percent to 3,940 forint. OTP purchased 100,000 treasury shares
on Aug. 19 at an average price of 3,897 forint each, the bank
said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
