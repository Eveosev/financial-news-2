United Nations  Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said he will convene an “urgent” meeting on Libya’s
future with the heads of the African Union, the  Arab League , the
European Union and a coalition of Islamic nations.  “This is a hopeful moment,” Ban said today of the
takeover of the Libyan capital, Tripoli, by the anti-government
forces. “It is testimony to the courage and determination of
the Libyan people to seek a free and democratic future.”  Ban, speaking to reporters in  New York , said that the
meeting likely would be held Aug. 25 or 26 and that he is also
calling for a meeting of the Security Council to give the UN a
mandate to assist  Libya ’s transition to a new government.  “The UN is prepared to assist in all vital areas,
including security, rule of law, social and economic recovery,
constitution-making, electoral process, human rights and
transitional justice,” Ban said. The UN  Department of
Peacekeeping Operations  has begun planning for a mission to
monitor a cease-fire, he said.  Ban said that while he had talked over the weekend with
Libyan Prime Minister Baghdadi al-Mahmoudi, he hasn’t been able
to speak with besieged Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi and doesn’t
know where he is.  To contact the reporter on this story:
