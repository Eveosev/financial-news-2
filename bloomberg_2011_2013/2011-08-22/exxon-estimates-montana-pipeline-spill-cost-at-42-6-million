Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) , the world’s
largest oil company by market value, estimated the cost to clean
up a July 1 oil spill into the Yellowstone River in Montana will
be $42.6 million, according to a filing with federal regulators.  The company’s emergency response to the spill from the
Silvertip pipeline will cost $40 million and property claims
will be $2.5 million, the company said in a July 29 filing with
the Transportation Department’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials
Safety Administration. Exxon also lost about $100,000 of oil and
other commodities in the spill, according to the document,
obtained by Bloomberg News through a Freedom of Information Act
request.  Exxon’s 69-mile (111-kilometer) Silvertip line spilled an
estimated 1,000 barrels of crude into a flood-swollen
Yellowstone River near Laurel,  Montana . The pipeline runs from
Elk Basin,  Wyoming  to Exxon’s refinery in Billings, Montana.  More than 1,000 people were working to clean up the site as
of Aug. 12, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency, which is leading the response effort. Sampling results
for air, water, soil and sediment around the river show “no
levels of concern” for water supplies or  air quality , the
agency said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
