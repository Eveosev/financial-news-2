Challenger Ltd. reported full-year
profit that beat analysts’ estimates, helped by demand for life
insurance products aimed at retirees that the Australian
investment manager expect will increase 25 percent.  Net income in the 12 months to June 30 fell to A$261.4
million ($271 million) from A$282.5 million a year earlier, the
Sydney-based company said in a statement today. Analysts had
forecast annual profit of A$254.6 million.  The shares rose the most in a year after Chief Executive
Officer Dominic Stevens predicted sales of so-called annuities
will climb 25 percent in the 12 months through June 2012 as
 Australia ’s rising population of retirees buy life insurance
products that generate a fixed income. Total assets under
management climbed 17 percent to A$27.9 billion.  Growth in annuities “is sustainable because  baby boomers 
controlling 60 percent of the assets in our trillion dollar
super system are beginning to retire,” Stevens said in today’s
statement.  The shares rose as much as 4.7 percent in intra-day trading,
the most since Aug. 23, 2010, and were 3.1 percent higher at
A$4.64 as of 10:11 a.m. in Sydney. The benchmark S&P/ASX 200
index is little changed today.  Challenger expects cash earnings for its life business to
increase 7 percent to A$430 million in the current fiscal year,
the company said today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
