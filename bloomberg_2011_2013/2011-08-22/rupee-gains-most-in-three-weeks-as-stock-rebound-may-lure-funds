India ’s rupee strengthened the most
in three weeks on speculation a rebound in the benchmark  stock
index  will encourage overseas funds to buy local equities.  The local currency reversed losses after earlier touching
its lowest level since November as the Bombay Stock Exchange’s
Sensitive Index snapped a two-day drop. Exporters also probably
sold dollars to benefit from the local currency’s weakness, said
Sudarshan Bhatt, chief foreign-exchange trader at state-owned
 Corporation Bank .  “The recovery in stocks provided support,” Mumbai-based
Bhatt said. “Some investors may have thought the rupee had
weakened too fast.”  The rupee advanced 0.2 percent to 45.68 per dollar at the 5
p.m. close in Mumbai, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
It reached 46.09, the weakest since Nov. 30.  Investors based abroad reduced holdings of local shares by
$1.4 billion this month, the most since January, according to
exchange data. The Sensex rose 1.2 percent today, paring its
decline this month to 10.2 percent.  Offshore forwards indicate the rupee will trade at 46.04 to
the dollar in three months, compared with expectations for a
rate of 46.09 on Aug. 18. Local markets were closed for a
holiday on Aug. 19. Forwards are agreements to buy or sell
assets at a set price and date. Non-deliverable contracts are
settled in dollars.  To contact the reporter on this story:
