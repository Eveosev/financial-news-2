Polish stocks climbed for a second
day, led by refiners and natural-gas distributor  Polskie
Gornictwo Naftowe i Gazownictwo SA (PGN) , as rising crude  oil prices 
improved earnings prospects.  The benchmark WIG20 Index rose 1.1 percent to 2,277.32 at
10:24 a.m. in Warsaw, having earlier lost 0.4 percent. The gauge
has slid 22 percent from this year’s high in April, because of
concern over Europe’s debt crisis and the U.S. credit rating
downgrade by  Standard & Poor’s .  “Stocks of energy producers were heavily oversold recently
and some investors may have seen their prices attractively
low,” said Monika Kalwasinska, a Warsaw-based analyst at PKO
Bank Polski SA’s brokerage. “It’s hard to say whether their
prices will continue a rebound, taking into account the
uncertainty on global markets.”  PKN Orlen SA, Poland’s biggest oil company, gained 1.9
percent to 35.46 zloty, trimming this month’s decline to 24
percent.  Grupa Lotos SA (LTS) , the second-largest refiner, rose 1.5
percent to 32.88 zloty. Oil erased earlier losses on the  New
York Mercantile Exchange . The September contract was up 42 cents
at $82.68 a barrel and the more actively traded October contract
rose 28 cents to $82.69 at 9:01 a.m. London time.  Gornictwo, the country’s largest natural-gas distributor,
increased 2.1 percent to 3.83 zloty. Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa
SA, a coking coal producer that sold shares in an initial public
offering in June, jumped 2.6 percent to 102.5 zloty.  To contact the reporter on this story:
