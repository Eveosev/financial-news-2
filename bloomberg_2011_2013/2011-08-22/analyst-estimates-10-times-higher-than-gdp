At a time when U.S. equities have
lost $2.9 trillion in market value, stock analysts are twice as
bullish as they’ve been over the past 56 years when compared
with economists.  Wall Street firms pushed up estimates for Standard & Poor’s
500 Index earnings for a 10th straight quarter, forecasting a 17
percent gain in 2011, data compiled by Bloomberg show. That’s
9.9 times more than economists say gross domestic product will
grow. The average ratio since 1954 is 5.4 times, the data show.  The split underscores the skittishness among investors,
whose confidence has been shaken by  Europe ’s debt crisis and the
slowing global economy. The S&P 500 is experiencing the biggest
swings on record and has lost 18 percent since April 29,
dragging its valuation down to 12.3 times earnings, almost the
lowest since the  bull market  began in March 2009. Benchmark
indexes in  Germany , Brazil and  Hong Kong  have fallen more than
20 percent from their highs, the common definition of a  bear
market .  “Everyone’s struggling right now with two questions,”
 Keith Wirtz , the Cincinnati-based chief investment officer at
Fifth Third Asset Management, which oversees $16.7 billion, said
in a telephone interview on Aug. 19. “Is there a recession on
the horizon, and where will earnings go? There’s a void of
information. People are discounting the chances of a recession
and what that could mean for earnings.”  Goldman’s Decline  Most U.S. stocks fell today, with 10 dropping for every
nine that rose, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s drop in the
last 15 minutes of trading wiped out the day’s second  S&P 500 
rally. The index added less than 0.1 percent to 1,123.82 after
climbing 2 percent. The measure has lost 11 percent in 2011.  Stocks tumbled around the world last week as Morgan Stanley
said global economic growth is slowing, manufacturing in the
Philadelphia region contracted by the most in more than two
years, and July existing-home sales unexpectedly decreased. The
S&P 500 slid 4.7 percent to 1,123.53, bringing its loss since
July 22 to 16 percent, the data show.  The amount wiped off of U.S. equities is more than the
value of publicly traded equity in Brazil and India combined,
Bloomberg data show.  Bulls say analysts will be vindicated because companies
have been able to boost profits when forecasts for economic
growth were stagnating in the past. The difference between
earnings estimates and GDP projections reached its widest level
on record at the time in 1995, the year of the S&P 500’s biggest
annual rally since 1958. Per-share income for companies in the
index climbed 31 percent that year, and it rallied 34 percent.  Likely Scenario  “If we grow at a moderate pace, earnings will do very
well,”  David Kelly , who helps oversee about $445 billion as
chief market strategist for JPMorgan Funds in New York, said in
a telephone interview on Aug. 19. The most likely scenario is a
GDP increase of between 1 percent and 3 percent in the next 12
months, he said. “Earnings like a mild climate like that, and
that’s proven very well for companies in the past. Either way,
stocks are priced for a recession.”  Bears say it’s only a matter of time before the analysts
capitulate and start cutting estimates as the economy slows.  Nick Sargen, of Fort Washington Investment Advisors,
predicts a repeat of 2007, when analysts failed to foresee the
credit crisis. Four years ago, analysts were expecting 2007
earnings to rise 14 percent. They ended up climbing 1 percent.
At the same time, economists had lowered their outlook as much
as 0.8 percentage point to 1.9 percent, the lowest level of the
year. As the economy contracted in 2008, analysts spent the year
ratcheting earnings estimates down 25 percent.  Buffett Vs. Feldman  “Economists started throwing in the towel toward the
second half the year, and analysts were late,” Sargen, the
chief investment officer at  Fort Washington  in Cincinnati, said
in a telephone interview on Aug. 19. His firm oversees more than
$38 billion. “If we’re in for weak growth and this raises the
risk of a recession, it’s inevitable that profits will be
impacted. The thing I’m most confident of is that analysts will
be bringing down their earnings projections.”  The debate was personified this month by  Warren Buffett ,
the billionaire chief executive officer of Omaha, Nebraska-based
Berkshire Hathaway Inc., and Harvard University economics
professor  Martin Feldstein , a member of the National Bureau of
Economic Research that measures recessions.  Buffett said his company spent more on stocks on Aug. 8
than any day this year, when the S&P 500 tumbled 6.7 percent,
the most since December 2008. “I like buying on sale,” he said
in an Aug. 15 interview with  Charlie Rose  broadcast on PBS.  Recession Odds  Feldstein, speaking on Bloomberg Television’s
“Surveillance Midday” with  Tom Keene , estimated on Aug. 2 that
there’s a 50 percent chance of a U.S. recession because housing
and unemployment aren’t improving.  Profit projections are climbing for companies from  Cabot
Oil & Gas Corp. (COG)  to  Abercrombie & Fitch Co. (ANF)  after executives
increased cash to record levels, lowered debt and cut costs. S&P
500 earnings have exceeded projections by about 7.7 percent each
quarter since the bull market began as the index rose as much as
102 percent through April 29, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Among the 500 companies in the index, 308 have had their
average analyst estimate for 2011 profit increased since June
30, Bloomberg data show. That compares with 294 at the same
point in the second quarter, when the S&P 500 was reaching its
2011 high of 1,363.61.  Cabot Projection  Cabot’s average projection rose 28 percent since June 30,
among the 20 biggest increases in the S&P 500. Since the
Houston-based energy producer reported second-quarter results
that beat the average estimate by 51 percent, the stock is down
6.2 percent, compared with the 14 percent drop in the S&P 500.
Cabot, with the second-biggest gain in the S&P 500 in 2011, may
post a 52 percent increase in net income for 2011, the most
since 2005, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  “Cabot reported an exceptional quarter both financially
and operationally,” wrote Jack Aydin, a New York-based analyst
at KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., who had the highest estimate
for second-quarter profit. The company beat his projection when
it reported last month. He raised his full-year outlook to $1.49
a share from $1.36.  Analysts have been boosting S&P 500 predictions since 2008,
by an average 2.2 percent a quarter, according to data compiled
by Bloomberg. The biggest increase was between April and June
2010, when the S&P 500 fell 12 percent. Profit projections
climbed 4.3 percent to $81.22 a share. Earnings rose to $84.45
in 2010, a 37 percent annual increase, the most since 1988.  Net Income  Net income has advanced seven straight quarters, climbing
20 percent in the first three months of 2011 and 17 percent in
the second, the data show. The gains came as economic growth
slowed. Gross domestic product in the first quarter expanded at
a 0.4 percent annual rate, compared with 3 percent in 2010.  “Real GDP was about 1 percent, earnings growth for the S&P
500, which is littered with these multinationals, was up in the
high teens,”  Bob Doll , the chief equity strategist at New York-
based BlackRock Inc., which manages $3.66 trillion, said in a
Bloomberg Radio interview with Keene on Aug. 17. “The U.S. S&P
500 can do better than the  U.S. economy .”  Abercrombie’s net income may jump 85 percent in 2011,
fueled by international sales, estimates compiled by Bloomberg
show. The  New Albany , Ohio-based retail chain is outperforming
the S&P 500 by 8.5 percentage points this year as second-quarter
revenue from stores abroad increased 74 percent. Robin Murchison, of SunTrust Banks Inc., forecast second-quarter
earnings of 34 cents a share, the closest to the 35-cent profit
Abercrombie reported. The analyst raised her full-year estimate
to $3.16 this month.  ‘Best Brand’  “Abercrombie has a very strong balance sheet, and they’ve
got one of the best global brand names out there,” Nashville,
Tennessee-based Murchison said in a telephone interview on Aug.
18. “World events and the negative rhetoric coming out of DC
have created the perception that things are going to get worse
from here, which is driving the stock down. But assuming we get
some stability in the global environment, Abercrombie will be
able to continue to draw sales for the rest of the year.”  The company’s stock has fallen 27 percent from its 2011
high of $77.14 on July 22. It plunged 8.7 percent on Aug. 17 and
9.7 percent on Aug. 18, the biggest two-day slide since 2008,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  “You have to engage in scenario analysis in a situation
like this -- ask yourself what’s the most likely scenario and
assign it a probability,”  Stephen Wood , who helps oversee $163
billion as the New York-based chief market strategist for
Russell Investments, said in a telephone interview on Aug. 19.
“For us, we’re still thinking the economy has recovered. Some
quarters are better than others, some are worse. For earnings,
the American corporates have very strong prospects.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
