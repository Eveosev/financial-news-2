Investors should buy  India ’s rupee
and sell the baht, Citigroup Inc. said, citing economic growth
concerns in Thailand.  The rupee has dropped 2.7 percent this month, the worst
performance among  Asia ’s 10 most-traded currencies, as global
shares slid on weak U.S. economic data and concern  Europe ’s debt
crisis is spreading. Thai gross domestic product increased 2.6
percent in the second quarter from a year earlier, data showed
today. That was less than the 3.6 percent median estimate of
economists surveyed by Bloomberg.  “The rupee has been the big underperformer since the end
of July for a multitude of reasons” including hedging by
importers, poor sentiment and equity weakness, Patrick Perret- Green, Citigroup’s head of rates and foreign exchange in
 Singapore , wrote in a research note released today. “It’s moved
too far. Moreover we have growing concerns about  Thailand , from
a government perspective and from a global economic exposure
one.”  India’s currency declined 0.4 percent to 45.95 per dollar
as of 12:02 p.m. in Mumbai, while three-month forwards rose 0.2
percent to 46.30, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
baht fell 0.2 percent to 29.87 per dollar, with three-month
forwards little changed at 30.015.  Perret-Green recommended buying rupee three-month non-
deliverable forwards at 46.35 per dollar and selling similar
contracts on the baht at 30.05.  -Editors: Andrew Janes, James Regan  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
