Hungary will probably leave its
benchmark  interest rate  unchanged for a seventh month as
Europe’s sovereign debt crisis weakens the forint, threatening
foreign-currency loans and economic growth.  The  Magyar Nemzeti  Bank will keep the two-week deposit rate
at 6 percent today, according to all 20 economists surveyed by
Bloomberg. The decision will be announced at 2 p.m. in Budapest,
with central bank President Andras Simor scheduled to comment at
3 p.m.  The forint fell this month to a record low against the
Swiss franc, in which most Hungarian mortgages are denominated.
While inflation is easing and data show the economy is slowing,
policy makers will probably forgo a rate cut to avoid further
weakening the forint, which would hurt borrowers in the Swiss
currency and lower their capacity to spend.  “The current volatility in the forint will hinder a move
any time soon,” Salomon Guillaume, emerging-market strategist
at Societe Generale SA in  London , wrote in a note to clients
yesterday. “We have little doubt that a rate cut is on the
cards in the autumn as long as the forint can regain some of its
recent losses.”  Forward-rate agreements fixing three-month interest costs
in six months fell to 5.66 percent today, the lowest since
November. The FRA traded 43 basis points below the three-month
Budapest Interbank Offered Rate to which it settles, compared
with a spread of minus three basis points after the last rate
decision on July 26. That shows investors expect the central
bank to lower its benchmark by at least 0.25 percentage points.  Franc Haven  The forint has declined 15.6 percent against the Swiss
franc since the end of April, falling to a record low of 272.62
on Aug. 10. The franc, seen by investors as a haven, advanced
after  Europe ’s debt crisis spread to Italy and  Spain  from
 Greece , Ireland and  Portugal  and  Standard & Poor’s  downgraded
the U.S. credit rating on Aug. 6 for the first time. It traded
at 237.87 at 9:50 a.m. in Budapest.  A rate cut would be “fatal for the forint at present,”
Carolin Hecht, a currency strategist at Commerzbank AG in
 Frankfurt , wrote today in a note.  The stronger franc is squeezing homeowners, who face higher
monthly payments on mortgages denominated in the Swiss currency.
OTP Bank Nyrt., Hungary’s top lender, fell 21.4 percent this
month, while the cost of insuring the nation’s debt against
default using five-year credit-default swaps rose to 412.79
basis points from a 2011 low of 238.17 on May 4.  Almost two thirds of the country’s mortgages were issued in
foreign currencies as of May 31, according to the central bank.  Economy Stalls  Hungary ’s economy stalled in the second quarter as global
growth faltered. Gross domestic product was unchanged from the
previous three months, while the pace of expansion slowed to 1.5
percent compared with the same period of last year from 2.5
percent in the first quarter.  The franc’s gains may trim growth by as much as 0.5
percentage point, Prime Minister  Viktor Orban ’s chief of staff,
 Mihaly Varga , said in an interview published July 22 on the
website of Gazdasagi Radio. Growth this year may be about 2
percent, less than the government’s initial 3.1 percent
forecast, Orban said last week.  The inflation rate fell to 3.1 percent in July, the lowest
since March 2009, from 3.5 percent in June. Inflation may
undershoot forecasts this year, according to Orban. The central
bank expects 2011 inflation to average 3.9 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
