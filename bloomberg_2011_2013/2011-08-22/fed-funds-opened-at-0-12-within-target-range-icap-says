Fed funds, the U.S. overnight inter-
bank lending rate, opened at 0.12 percent, within the  Federal
Reserve ’s target of zero to 0.25 percent.  Fed funds closed at 0.09 percent on Aug. 19 after trading
from 0.04 percent to 0.3 percent and averaging 0.1 percent, ICAP
Plc, the world’s largest inter-dealer broker, said in an e-
mailed statement.  The central bank will acquire Treasuries maturing from
November 2021 to August 2041. The purchases are part of the
Fed’s policy to continue to reinvest the proceeds of maturing
assets on its balance sheet to cap borrowing costs.  The central bank plans to purchase from $500 million to $1
billion of securities today, according to the New York Fed’s
website.  To contact the reporter on this story:
