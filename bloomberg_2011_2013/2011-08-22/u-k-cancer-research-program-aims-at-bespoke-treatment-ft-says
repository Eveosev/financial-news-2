The U.K. will start its first
nationwide genetic testing program for cancer patients in
September, with government, charitable and private commercial
support, the Financial Times reported.  Cancer Research  U.K. is leading the program, which is aimed
at tailoring patientsâ€™ treatments to the genetic nature of their
tumors, the newspaper said.  Initially, seven hospitals and three laboratories will
collect and analyse 9,000 samples from six common cancers:
breast, bowel, lung, prostate, ovary and melanoma; the samples
will be tested for genes and mutations that have been identified
as being likely to play a role in the development of the
disease, the FT said.  That is likely to generate a coordinated program of
personalised cancer treatment based on genetic testing, the
newspaper said.  AstraZeneca Plc,  Pfizer Inc. (PFE)  and PA Consulting Group will
be working with Cancer Research and the National Health Service
on the project, the FT said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
