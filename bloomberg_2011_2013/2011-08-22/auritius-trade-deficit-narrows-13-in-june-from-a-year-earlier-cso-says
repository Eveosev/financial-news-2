Mauritiusâ€™s trade deficit narrowed
13 percent in June compared with a year earlier as machinery
imports declined, the  Central Statistics Office  said.  The shortfall fell to 4.78 billion rupees ($172 million)
from 5.47 billion rupees, the Port Louis-based data agency said
in a  statement  on its website today.  Imports dropped 4 percent to 11 billion rupees as shipments
of machinery and transport equipment dropped 28 percent, while
exports rose 3.9 percent to 6.2 billion rupees, it said.  The Indian Ocean island nation is a net importer of food
and fuels, with India, China and  South Africa  as main suppliers,
according to the agency. The U.K, France and the U.S. are the
biggest buyers of its manufactured goods.  To contact the reporter on this story:
