Peru’s sol advanced to a three-year
high as speculation the  Federal Reserve  will announce a plan to
stimulate growth spurred demand for emerging-market assets.  The sol strengthened 0.1 percent to 2.7315 per  U.S. dollar 
at 12:54 p.m. New York time, from 2.7340 on Aug. 19. That’s the
currency’s strongest level since April 2008.  Demand for Peru’s financial assets has risen amid optimism
the U.S. central bank will begin a third round of debt purchases
to lower borrowing costs and boost the world’s biggest economy.  Increased dollar sales by Peruvian banks led the Andean
country’s central bank to buy the U.S. currency in the spot
market for the first time since July 26 as it seeks to slow the
sol’s appreciation, said Antonio Diaz, a trader at Banco
Internacional del  Peru .  “Local banks have accumulated a lot of dollars and decided
to sell them today as the market context is positive,” Diaz
said.  The central bank announces any dollar purchases on its
website after 2:30 p.m. New York time.  To contact the reporter on this story:
