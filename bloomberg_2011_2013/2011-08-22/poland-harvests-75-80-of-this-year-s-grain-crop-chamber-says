Poland  harvested 75 percent to 80
percent of its grain planted area by Aug. 19 after sun allowed
farmers to accelerate field work, the Polish Grain Chamber said.  Farmers in northern Poland are behind the national average,
with about half of their crop harvested, according to the
chamber, whose members include producers, traders and grain-
processing companies.  The wheat harvest in Poland, the European Union’s fourth-
largest grower of the grain, usually starts in July. Farm
Minister Marek Sawicki said earlier this month that the country
was facing the most difficult harvest in more than a decade
because of heavy rain in July and early August.  To contact the reporter on this story:
