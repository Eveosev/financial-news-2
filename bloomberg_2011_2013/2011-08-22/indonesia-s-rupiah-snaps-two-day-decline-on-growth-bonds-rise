Indonesia ’s rupiah advanced,
snapping a two-day decline, on optimism global investors will
boost holdings of local assets to benefit from growth in
 Southeast Asia ’s largest economy. Government bonds rose.  Gross domestic product will rise 6.5 percent this year, the
most since 1998, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told
lawmakers on Aug. 16. The currency has advanced 5 percent in
2011 as global funds bought $1.9 billion more Indonesian stocks
than they sold through Aug. 19, exchange data show.  “Positive sentiment toward the Indonesian economy is
supporting the currency,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta. “Growth numbers
are also helping capital inflows.”  The rupiah gained 0.2 percent to 8,548 per dollar as of
3:15 p.m. in Jakarta, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  The yield on the 8.25 percent  government bonds  due July
2021 fell four basis points to 6.89 percent, according to the
Inter-Dealer Market Association.  Overseas ownership of government notes rose 26 percent to
244.5 trillion rupiah ($28.6 billion) this year through Aug. 19,
according to the debt-management office.  To contact the reporter on this story:
