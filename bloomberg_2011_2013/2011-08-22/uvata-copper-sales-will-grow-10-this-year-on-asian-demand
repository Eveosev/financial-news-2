Luvata, the maker of copper
components for everything from solar panels to zippers, expects
an almost 10 percent increase in sales this year thanks to
demand in  Asia .  The company should sell about 335,500 metric tons of
copper-based products, compared with 305,000 tons last year,
John Peter Leesi, chief executive officer, said Aug. 18. That
compares with 20 percent growth last year from 255,000 tons in
2009.  “We have a recovery and overall we will have growth in our
copper deliveries and products based on copper,” Leesi said in
a phone interview from the company’s headquarters in Brentford,
west London,  England . “We have solid growth in  China , South
East Asia, and so on,” he said, pointing to “fairly strong
support” from the residential construction, industrial
production and electrical engineering sectors.  Global copper consumption may rise 3.9 percent this year,
slowing from a 7.8 percent growth last year, according to
 Barclays Capital . Copper for three-month delivery reached a
record $10,190 a ton in February on the London Metal Exchange,
falling 12 percent since then on concerns sovereign debt crisis
in  Europe  and the U.S., and a slowdown in China, will dent
demand for industrial metals.  “Softening” Demand  “There is a recovery that will go on, but there is
uncertainty and cautiousness in the market with regards to
investments,” Leesi said. About 29 percent of the company’s
sales are from Asia.  “We have a little bit of a softening,” Leesi said
referring to the third quarter. “In the fourth quarter we’re
going to see some improvement again.”  Luvata’s sales figures include deliveries from the
company’s rolled products division up until Aurubis AG’s deal to
buy the unit is completed in Sept. 1. The division has an
annualized output of 160,000 tons of copper and copper-alloy
products, according to a company statement. Following the sale,
Luvata expects to use about 200,000 tons of copper a year.  Copper rose $6.25, or 0.1 percent, to $8,831.25 a ton by
11:08 a.m. on the LME.  “We remain optimistic,” Leesi said. “We do not
necessarily believe that the worries and problems that we see in
the financial markets have to translate in any type of
recession.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
