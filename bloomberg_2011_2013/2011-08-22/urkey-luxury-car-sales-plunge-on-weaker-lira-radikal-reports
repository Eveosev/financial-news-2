Sales of luxury cars in  Turkey  have
declined about 70 percent in August as a weaker lira put
vehicles priced in euros further out of reach,  Radikal  newspaper
reported.  Orders for BMWs at Turkish distributor Borusan Otomotiv
Ithalat & Dagitim AS fell to 97 in the first week of August from
375 in the same period last year, the Istanbul-based newspaper
said, citing board member Esref Biryildiz.  Customer visits to the showroom of Dogus Otomotiv Servis &
Ticaret AS, distributor of Audi, Lamborghini and Bentley cars in
Turkey, fell 30 percent in the same period, the newspaper said,
citing Gino Bottaro, the companyâ€™s general manager for those
brands.  The Turkish lira has depreciated 25 percent against the
euro in the past year, according to Bloomberg data.  To contact the reporter on this story:
