Tanzania’s shilling appreciated the
most in more than 14 months against the dollar as mining and
tourism companies sold the greenback.  The currency of East  Africa ’s second-biggest economy’s
surged as much as 3.6 percent, the most since June 2010, to
1,562.5 per dollar and traded 0.2 percent up at 1,619 by 1:41
p.m. in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania’s commercial capital. It
rebounded from 1,633.2 on Aug. 19, the weakest intraday level
since at least 1994.  “There have been inflows of dollars from the mining
companies and tourism proceeds,” Eric Chijoriga, a trader at
National Bank of Commerce Ltd.,  Absa Group Ltd. (ASA) ’s local unit,
said by phone. “This is when tourist season begins.”  Tanzania vies with Mali to be Africa’s third-biggest
producer of gold after Ghana and South Africa. The country’s
inflation rate climbed to 13 percent in July, the fastest pace
in 15 months, on higher energy and food costs, the National
Bureau of Statistics said on Aug. 15.  To contact the reporter on this story:
