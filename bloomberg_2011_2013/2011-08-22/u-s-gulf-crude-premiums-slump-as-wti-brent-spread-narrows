U.S. Gulf oil premiums slumped after
the discount of benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude to Brent
narrowed the most in two months.  The gap between October contracts weakened $1.84 to $24.37
a barrel at 12:58 p.m. in  New York , the most the gap has shrunk
since June 24. The spread settled Aug. 19 at a record margin  of
$26.21 a barrel.  When Brent decreases versus WTI, it weakens the value of
low-sulfur U.S. grades that compete with West African oil priced
against the European benchmark.  Heavy Louisiana Sweet lost $3.90 to $23 a barrel over WTI
at 12:17 p.m. in New York, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. Light Louisiana Sweet’s premium decreased $3.20 to
$20.25 a barrel.  Among sour, or high-sulfur, grades, the premium for Mars
Blend narrowed $2 to $21 while Poseidon weakened $1.75 to $21 a
barrel over WTI.  Southern Green Canyon’s premium decreased $1.75 to $19 a
barrel. West Texas Sour’s discount widened 15 cents to 90 cents.
Thunder Horse’s premium lost $2.25 to $24.50 above the
benchmark.  The premium for Syncrude was unchanged at $15 a barrel.
Syncrude is a light, low-sulfur synthetic oil derived from the
 tar sands  in  Alberta .  The discount for Western Canada Select was unchanged at
$13.40 a barrel.  To contact the reporter on this story:
