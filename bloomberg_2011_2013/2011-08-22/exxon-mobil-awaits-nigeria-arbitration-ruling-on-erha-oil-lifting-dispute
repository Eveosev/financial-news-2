Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM) ’s Nigerian unit is
awaiting an arbitration ruling to end its dispute with the
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp. over “entitlements to lift
crude oil” from the Erha offshore field.  “We can confirm that the arbitration hearing ended in
Abuja on March 2,” Nigel Cookey-Gam, an Exxon spokesman in
 Nigeria , said today in an e-mailed statement. The “parties are
currently awaiting an award by the tribunal.”  Exxon, the world’s biggest company, sought arbitration in
2009 after talks with the Nigerian government and the state oil
company, known as NNPC, had “been unsuccessful,” the statement
said. There’s no specific date yet for the ruling, said Cookey-
Gam.  Levi Ajuonuma , a NNPC spokesman, declined to comment.  The Erha field, located about 97 kilometers (60 miles)
offshore Nigeria, started production in 2006 and has the
capacity to pump about 190,000 barrels of crude a day. Exxon
Mobil, operator of the field, holds a 56.25 percent interest and
Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Co., a local unit of
 Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , holds 43.75 percent.  Nigeria, Africa’s top oil producer, is the fifth-biggest
source of U.S. imports of the fuel. Shell, Exxon, Chevron Corp.,
Total SA and Eni SpA run joint ventures with state-owned NNPC,
which pumps about 90 percent of the country’s crude.  To contact the reporter on this story:
