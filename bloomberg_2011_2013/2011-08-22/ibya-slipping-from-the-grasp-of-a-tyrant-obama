Libya is “slipping from the grasp
of a tyrant” now that rebel forces have moved into the capital
Tripoli, U.S. President  Barack Obama  said today in a statement.  “Tonight, the momentum against the Qaddafi regime has
reached a tipping point,” Obama, on vacation in Martha’s
Vineyard, Massachusetts, said. “The surest way for the
bloodshed to end is simple:  Muammar Qaddafi  and his regime need
to recognize that their rule has come to an end.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
