BYD Co. plunged to a two-year low in
 Hong Kong  after profit fell 99 percent, extending a slump that
has erased $7 billion in market value from the Chinese automaker
part-owned by Warren Buffett’s  Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRK/A)   Net income fell to 8.62 million yuan ($1.35 million) in the
second quarter from 717 million yuan a year earlier, according
to figures derived by subtracting first-quarter from first-half
figures. The Shenzhen-based automaker’s vehicle sales declined 
for a 12th straight month in July as the popularity of its best-
selling model, the F3 sedan, waned.  BYD fell 14 percent to HK$16.18 today, the lowest close
since April 15, 2009. The stock has tumbled 81 percent from its
record close on Oct. 23, 2009, reversing a more than 10-fold
surge after Berkshire Hathaway unit MidAmerican Energy Holdings
Co. agreed to buy a 9.9 percent stake in September 2008.  “We keep frequent contact with Mr. Buffett and he can see
our various operational data,” BYD Chairman  Wang Chuanfu  said
in Hong Kong today when asked whether Buffett plans to reduce
his holdings. “I believe we will maintain a good relationship
with him.”  Buffett’s stake in BYD has lost about $2 billion of value
since its peak. By comparison, he booked a $3.5 billion profit
in 2007 selling a stake in PetroChina Co., the country’s largest
oil producer, that he acquired for about $500 million.  GM, Honda Models  BYD’s slump adds to losses for Berkshire Hathaway, which
has dropped 15 percent in U.S. trading this year as global
equity markets retreated. Berkshire Vice Chairman Charles Munger
said July 2 that BYD has the ability to recover from missteps
because its executives “just put their head down and try
harder” when they fail.  Rivals General Motors Co. and Honda Motor Co. added new
models, and  China ’s government phased out buying incentives and
imposed purchase restrictions to curb congestion.  “They need to figure out a way to revive sales,” said
Chen Xiaoxia, a Hong Kong-based analyst at First Shanghai
Securities Ltd., which has a “hold” rating on the stock. “BYD
didn’t have another best-selling model like the F3 to beef up
sales.”  Wang said he’s confident of selling more vehicles in the
second half because more models will be on the market. The
automaker will introduce the G6 sedan in September and may step
up production of its S6 sport-utility vehicle from 6,000 units
in August to 15,000 units a month by year’s end to meet demand
that is outpacing supply, he said.  Stimulus Ends  Profit in the first six months of the year dropped 89
percent to 275.4 million yuan as the end of preferential taxes
for small cars led to a drop in sales, the company said
yesterday in a statement to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.  First-half revenue declined 12 percent to 22.5 billion yuan
as automobile sales fell 27 percent in the same period to 9.54
billion yuan.  BYD’s vehicle sales fell 23 percent in the first seven
months of 2011 compared with an increase of 5.9 percent in
China’s industrywide passenger-car deliveries.  “The fast growth trend of the domestic automobile industry
has slackened” in the first half with the withdrawal of
stimulus policies, BYD said in its filing to the stock exchange.  ‘Fast Growth’  Domestic automakers saw a decline in market share as they
were more sensitive to government policy and a surge in  oil
prices , it said. Last year, BYD delivered 519,806 cars, missing
a 600,000-vehicle forecast.  Profit in the first quarter fell 84 percent to 239.6
million yuan. BYD said its nine-month net income may fall 85
percent to 95 percent from a year earlier to as much as 364.9
million yuan.  BYD will have “fast growth” in the fourth quarter, Wang
said. The company will export the all-electric E6 car and
electric buses to the U.S. and  Europe  next year, and a right-
hand drive E6 will go on sale in Hong Kong in June 2012, he said.  BYD, which also makes rechargeable batteries for handsets
and notebook computers, said demand was affected in the first
half by “sluggish” economic growth in Europe and the U.S.,
according to its stock exchange filing.  Rechargeable battery sales rose 19 percent in the first
half to 2.42 billion yuan, while revenue from handset components
and assembly gained 3.3 percent to 9.51 billion yuan.  BYD’s Shenzhen-listed shares gained 1.2 percent, erasing an
earlier 2.5 percent decline.  Paul Lin , a BYD spokesman, said he
had no comment on the second-quarter calculations.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
