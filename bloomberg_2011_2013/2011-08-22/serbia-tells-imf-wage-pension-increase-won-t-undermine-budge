Serbia will adjust public-sector
wages and pensions for inflation in October, while honoring its
own budget-gap limits, the government said after talks with the
 International Monetary Fund .  The government will seek to cut other expenditures “on all
levels of government” to make a new precautionary arrangement
with the Washington-based lender, the office of Prime Minister
 Mirko Cvetkovic  said in an e-mailed statement after meeting with
the IMF delegation led by Albert Jaeger.  The expected 18-month precautionary loan accord worth
around 1 billion euros ($1.44 billion) is “very important for
Serbia because it will represent confirmation to all foreign
investors that Serbia conducts a credible economic policy,” the
statement said.  The government has pledged to keep this year’s budget gap
under 4.25 percent of gross domestic product and reduce it to
3.2 percent in 2012. Talks with the IMF include a revision of
this year’s budget and a draft for the next. The mission is in
Belgrade through Aug. 30.  Serbia  also plans a Eurobond sale worth up to $1 billion
that will offer investors dollar- and dinar-denominated
tranches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
