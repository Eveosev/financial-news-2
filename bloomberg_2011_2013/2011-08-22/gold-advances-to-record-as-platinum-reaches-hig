Gold surged to a record $1,899.40 an
ounce as mounting concern that the global economy is slowing
amid debt crises spurred demand for bullion as a protection of
wealth. Platinum rose to a three-year high.  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  attempted to shut the door
on common euro-area bonds as a means to solve the debt crisis,
saying she won’t let financial markets dictate policy. The
 Federal Reserve  holds its annual symposium in  Jackson Hole ,
 Wyoming , this week, amid speculation that it may signal a third
round of asset purchases to boost the faltering recovery.  “The sovereign-debt issues remain, and Germany has to
decide whether it wants to carry the financial burden of the
rest of  Europe  on its shoulder,”  Matthew Zeman , a strategist at
Kingsview Financial in Chicago, said in a telephone interview.
“There are expectations that the Fed may talk about printing
more money, and that is positive for gold and negative for the
dollar.”  Gold futures for December delivery gained $39.70, or 2.1
percent, to close at $1,891.90 an ounce at 2:05 p.m. on the
Comex in New York, the highest settlement ever. The precious
metal rose 6.3 percent last week, the most since February 2009.
It has advanced 16 percent this month.  ‘Remains in Demand’  “Gold is still the safe haven, and as long as people fear
recession in the U.S. and euro-zone debt problems, gold remains
in demand,”  Peter Fertig , the owner of Quantitative Commodity
Research Ltd. in Hainburg, Germany, said by telephone. More U.S.
asset purchases “would be bullish for gold,” he said.  The dollar has declined 6.3 percent against a basket of six
currencies this year. Gold is in the 11th year of a bull market,
the longest winning streak since at least 1920 in  London , as
investors seek to diversify their holdings away from equities
and some currencies. Global stocks earlier this month slipped to
an 11-month low, and bullion reached all-time highs today in
euros, British pounds and Swiss francs.  The metal has gained 33 percent this year. The MSCI All-
Country World Index fell 12 percent, the Standard & Poor’s GSCI
Index of 24 commodities rose 2.4 percent, while Treasuries
returned 7.7 percent, a Bank of America Merrill Lynch index
showed.  Quantitative Easing  The Fed bought $600 billion in Treasuries from November
through June in a second round of so-called quantitative easing,
or QE2. The central bank said Aug. 9 that U.S. economic growth
was “considerably slower” than anticipated and it’s ready to
use a range of policy tools to boost the economy. The Fed
pledged to keep  interest rates  near zero at least until
mid-2013.  Silver futures for December delivery in  New York  gained
89.8 cents, or 2.1 percent, to close at $43.365 an ounce on the
Comex. Earlier, it jumped to $44.10, the highest since May 3.  Platinum futures for October delivery advanced $30.80, or
1.6 percent, to $1,905.70 an ounce on the New York Mercantile
Exchange, after touching $1,909.90, the highest since July 17,
2008. The metal gained for the 11th straight session, the
longest rally since October 2007.  Palladium futures for September delivery rose $16.30, or
2.2 percent, to $765.10 an ounce on the Nymex.  To contact the reporters for this story:
