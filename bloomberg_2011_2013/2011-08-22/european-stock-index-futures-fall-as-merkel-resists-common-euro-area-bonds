European stocks rebounded from a
two-year low amid speculation the  Federal Reserve  may this week
signal additional stimulus measures and as prospects for an end
to the war in Libya boosted energy companies.  Eni SpA (ENI)  and  Petrofac Ltd. (PFC)  led a rally in oil companies,
both rising more than 3 percent.  Petropavlovsk Plc (POG)  jumped 6.2
percent as Citigroup Inc. upgraded the gold producer and the
precious metal advanced to an all-time high. Jyske Bank A/S
dropped 7.6 percent as earnings missed estimates.  The benchmark Stoxx  Europe  600 Index rose 0.8 percent to
224.9 at the 4:30 p.m. close in London, having earlier lost the
same amount. The gauge retreated 6.1 percent last week,
extending its decline from this year’s high to 23 percent, as
European and U.S. economic data that trailed forecasts added to
concern the global recovery is at risk. The retreat has left the
Stoxx 600 trading at about 9.3 times its companies’ estimated
earnings, near the lowest since March 2009, Bloomberg data show.  “We believe the Fed will want to reassure markets and
could use Friday’s  Jackson Hole  symposium to do so,” Graham Bishop, an equity strategist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc
in  London , wrote in a report. “The Fed’s commitment to keep
rates on hold until 2013 is, arguably, the precursor to a more
significant policy announcement.”  The Fed is holding its annual symposium in Jackson Hole,
 Wyoming , this weekend. This time last year Chairman  Ben S.
Bernanke  hinted that the central bank might embark on a second
round of asset purchases, kicking off a 28 percent rally in the
 S&P 500  that ended in a three-year high on April 29.  Fed Stimulus  Record-low yields on Treasuries show traders expect
Bernanke to signal the bank will begin a third program of bond
buying to boost the economy. Barclays Plc said 10-year yields
indicate traders have priced in $500 billion to $600 billion of
Treasury purchases by the Fed. Citigroup said current rates can
only be justified by more bond buying or assuming the economy
will shrink by 2 percent.  National benchmark indexes climbed in 12 of the 18 western
European markets. The U.K.’s  FTSE 100 Index (UKX)  and France’s CAC 40
Index each increased 1.1 percent, while Germany’s DAX Index
slipped 0.1 percent.  Gains in European stocks were limited as German Chancellor
 Angela Merkel  resisted calls for common euro-area borrowing.
Speaking in an interview with ZDF television from the
chancellery in Berlin yesterday, she said bringing in euro bonds
at this time would further undermine economic stability.  ECB Purchases  The  European Central Bank  spent less on  government bonds 
last week as yields fell in Italy and Spain. The Frankfurt-based
ECB said today it settled purchases worth 14.3 billion euros
($20.6 billion) in the week through Aug. 19, down from the 22
billion euros it spent the previous week.  Eni, the Italian oil company that was the biggest foreign
producer in Libya, rallied 6.3 percent to 13.27 euros after
rebel fighters reached the capital Tripoli. The overthrow of
Muammar Qaddafi’s government may allow Eni and other oil
producers to start fields closed by the civil war.  Petrofac, which said today it expects to bid for work in
Libya after the end of the conflict, added 3.7 percent to 1,211
pence. The oilfield-services provider also reported first-half
earnings rose 6.6 percent to $246.3 million.  Total SA (FP) , France’s largest oil company, climbed 2.3 percent
to 32.71 euros.  Petropavlovsk jumped 6.2 percent to 779 pence as Citigroup
upgraded the producer of gold in Russia to “buy” from “hold”
and the precious metal rallied for a sixth day.  Avocet, GDF  Avocet Mining Plc (AVM)  surged 6.2 percent to 257.25 pence after
the producer of gold in West Africa upgraded the resource
estimate at its Inata mine in  Burkina Faso .  GDF Suez (GSZ)  SA, Europe’s largest natural-gas network operator,
climbed 3.5 percent to 20.17 euros, leading a rally in
utilities. BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research named the company
among its preferred utility stocks, saying GDF provides
“attractive relative valuations over the next 12 months.”  Suez Environnement, Europe’s second largest water company,
gained 1.8 percent to 11.40 euros and  International Power Plc (IPR) 
increased 2.7 percent to 301.9 pence.  IG Group Holdings Plc (IGG)  climbed 4 percent to 409.4 pence
after the owner of the IG Index financial spread-betting brand
said sales for the first quarter may increase 19 percent as more
people place wagers because of recent market swings. Revenue
will rise to more than 94 million pounds ($155 million) for the
quarter ending Aug. 31, from 79.1 million pounds a year earlier.  ICAP Plc (IAP) , the world’s largest broker of trades between
banks, gained 3.8 percent to 425 pence and Tullet Prebon Plc
increased 1.7 percent to 335.5 pence.  Danish Banks  Jyske Bank dropped 7.6 percent to 145.80 kroner after
Denmark’s second-largest lender reported a 47 percent decline in
second-quarter net income of 88 million kroner ($17 million)
that missed the average analyst estimate of 260 million kroner,
according to a Bloomberg survey.  Sydbank A/S, Denmark’s third-largest publicly traded
lender, lost 3.1 percent to 97.50 kroner and Danske Bank A/S
slid 3.6 percent to 74.35 kroner.  Micro Focus International Plc (MCRO)  fell 3.4 percent to 254 pence
after the company said it terminated talks with possible
bidders. The U.K. software provider said it’s restarting a
program to buy back as many as 12.3 million shares under its
existing authority.  Essar Energy Plc (ESSR)  dropped 3.8 percent to 247.9 pence amid
delays in setting up power plants and gaining approval for coal
projects. The Indian energy company said regulators stalled
approval of some coal-bed methane projects, which generate
natural gas from coal fields.  To contact the reporter on this story:
