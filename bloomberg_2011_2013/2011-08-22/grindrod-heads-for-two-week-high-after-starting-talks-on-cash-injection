Grindrod Ltd. (GND) ,  Africa â€™s biggest
shipping company, headed for the highest closing level in more
than two weeks after saying it entered negotiations with an
unidentified partner that may result in a capital injection of
as much as 2 billion rand.  The stock surged as much as 6.8 percent, the most since May
25, to 14:10 rand, and traded 6.1 percent up at 14 rand by 12:49
p.m. in Johannesburg. A close at this price would be the
strongest since Aug. 4.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
