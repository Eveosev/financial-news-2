What follows are opening calls for
U.S. grain and oilseed markets.  -- Corn futures may open 8 cents to 10 cents a bushel higher on
the  Chicago  Board of Trade on speculation that recent rains in
the U.S. Midwest werenâ€™t enough to ease dry conditions and abate
damage to yields, Greg Grow, the director of agribusiness at
Archer Financial Services Inc. in Chicago, said in a telephone
interview.  -- Soybean futures may open 12 cents to 14 cents a bushel higher
in Chicago on speculation that yields may decrease because of
dry weather, Grow said. Soybean-oil futures are expected to open
up 0.3 cent to 0.5 cent a pound, and soybean-meal futures may
open $3 to $5 higher for 2,000 pounds. A government report today
may show deteriorating crop conditions in the Midwest, he said.  -- Wheat futures may open 12 cents to 14 cents a bushel higher
on the CBOT, the Kansas City Board of Trade and the  Minneapolis
Grain Exchange  as U.S. winter-crop acres may decline because of
drought in the Great Plains, Grow said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
