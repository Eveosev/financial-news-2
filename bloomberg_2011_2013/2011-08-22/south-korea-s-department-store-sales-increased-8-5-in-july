Sales growth at major South Korean
department stores were little changed last month, a sign that
consumer demand may be faltering.  Outlays at the three biggest chains increased 8.5 percent
in July from a year earlier, after rising 8.2 percent in June,
the Ministry of Knowledge Economy said in a statement today.
Discount-store sales rose 4.9 percent from a year earlier after
a 2.7 percent gain in June, today’s report said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
