Delta Air Lines Inc. (DAL)  plans to order
100  Boeing Co. (BA)  737 single-aisle jets, a rebuff to Airbus SAS, as
it refreshes its fleet with planes valued at $8.58 billion, two
people familiar with the matter said.  Directors at Atlanta-based Delta will vote this week on the
purchase of the 737-900 extended-range model, said one of the
people, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly. A decision on
buying smaller narrow-body jets, such as  Bombardier Inc. (BBD/B) ’s
CSeries, has been delayed past this week, three people said.  Winning the Delta deal is a boost for Boeing after losing
its exclusive ties to American Airlines July 20 as the carrier
divided a 460-plane order between the U.S. company and Toulouse,
France-based Airbus. Delta had flown only Boeings until adding
hundreds of Airbus planes by buying  Northwest Airlines  in 2008.  “If this order is just 100 planes, they don’t need to
split it,” because one manufacturer can deliver that many jets,
said Jeff Straebler, an aviation debt strategist at RBS
Securities Inc. in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Industry speculation that Airbus would be favored at Delta
was fueled by the history of Chief Executive Officer  Richard Anderson , who was Northwest’s CEO when that carrier bought more
of the company’s models. Airbus also split an order with Boeing
for wide-body jets from  United Airlines  in 2009.  Delta doesn’t comment on its plans for aircraft purchases,
said Trebor Banstetter, a spokesman. John Dern, a spokesman for
Boeing, and Airbus’s Martin Fendt declined to comment.  Shares Advance  Boeing rose 84 cents, or 1.5 percent, to $58.38 at 4:01
p.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading, while Delta
gained 1 cent to $7.22. Airbus parent European Aeronautic
Defence & Space Co. added 32 cents, or 1.5 percent, to 21.09
euros in Paris.  The order would make Delta the second-largest customer for
the 737-900ER, behind  Indonesia ’s Lion Air.  The jet can carry about 200 passengers, and is the largest
version of the  737 family  that is the world’s most widely flown
airliner. The 737-900ER is powered by existing engines, not ones
that Boeing said last month it is developing for a new variant
of the 737 to compete with Airbus’s A320neo family.  “The 737-900ERs have a wide variety of things they can
replace on domestic flying,” Straebler said in an interview.  2013 Timeline  Delta told employees in an internal website posting in
January that it might start getting new narrow-body planes as
soon as 2013, and buying a model from Boeing’s existing lineup
may allow the airline to meet that schedule.  Boeing’s revamped 737s will start entering service in
“mid-decade,” and  AMR Corp. (AMR) ’s American won’t start receiving
its re-engined aircraft until 2018, the planemaker said last
month.  New narrow-body jets would allow Delta to replace its
oldest and least-efficient planes, including some Boeing 757s
that average 18 years of age and MD-88s that are almost 21 years
old. The 737-900ER has a list price of $85.8 million, according
to Boeing’s  website . Airlines typically buy at a discount.  Delta had said in January that it planned to buy 100 to 200
narrow-body jets and seek options for 200 more, with deliveries
starting as soon as 2013.  The airline hasn’t made a decision on adding smaller
narrow-body aircraft, such as Bombardier’s CSeries and a
potential offering from  Brazil ’s  Embraer SA (EMBR3) , three people said.
Embraer has yet to decide whether it will build a new plane or a
version of its largest regional jet with new engines to compete
with Montreal-based Bombardier’s offering.  Delta has been in talks with Bombardier and Embraer, two
people familiar with that matter said.  John Arnone , a spokesman for Bombardier, declined to
comment. Calls left for comment with Sao Jose Dos Campos,
Brazil-based Embraer weren’t immediately returned.  To contact the reporters on this story:
