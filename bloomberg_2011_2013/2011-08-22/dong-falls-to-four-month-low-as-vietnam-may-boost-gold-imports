The Vietnamese dong fell to a four-
month low on speculation the nation will allow more gold imports
to cool local prices, widening the trade deficit.  Government
bonds  fell.  The  State Bank  of Vietnam permitted local companies on Aug.
9 to buy a total five metric tons of gold after domestic bullion
prices surged to a record. The bank has indicated it may let
businesses import an additional five tons to meet demand. The
trade shortfall was $6.6 billion in the seven months through
July, according to government data.  The central bank “may carry out a second official import
of gold in order to cool down” the market and discourage
illegal imports, ACB Securities Inc. said in a report dated Aug.
19. “This may have a negative impact on the  trade balance .”  The dong fell 0.2 percent to 20,820 per dollar as of 2:47
p.m. in Hanoi, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
currency has weakened 1.2 percent this month, headed for the
biggest decline since February.  The central bank set the dong-dollar  reference rate  at
20,618 today, unchanged since Aug. 10, according to its website.
The local currency is allowed to trade up to 1 percent on either
side of the fixing.  International gold prices rose for a sixth day to an all-
time high as a global economic slowdown bolstered demand for
safer assets. Immediate-delivery bullion gained as much as 1.6
percent to $1,882.55 an ounce, and traded at $1,881.50 at 2:14
p.m. in  Singapore . In Vietnam, gold rose to as high as 48.75
million dong ($2,341) per tael in Hanoi as of 2:30 p.m. local
time, according to information from Vietnam Posts and
Telecommunications. One tael is about 1.2 ounces.  The yield on  Vietnam ’s five-year bonds climbed seven basis
points, or 0.07 percentage point, to 12.57 percent, according to
a daily fixing price from banks compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
