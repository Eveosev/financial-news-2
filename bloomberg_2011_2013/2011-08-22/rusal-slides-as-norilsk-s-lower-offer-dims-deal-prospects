United Co. Rusal’s Russian
depositary receipts dropped the most in more than two weeks
after OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel lowered an offer to buy back
shares, dimming prospects a deal will be reached that may help
Rusal fund debt repayments.  The RDRs slumped as much as 6.1 percent before closing 3.3
percent lower at 297.84 rubles by 6:45 p.m. in Moscow, their
biggest loss since Aug. 8. The company’s shares traded in  Hong
Kong  fell as much as 9.1 percent to HK$7.42.  Norilsk offered to buy back a 15 percent stake for $8.75
billion, less than the $12.8 billion proposed for a 20 percent
stake that was rebuffed March 4, Moscow-based Norilsk said on
Aug. 19. Rusal said today it has not received any official bid.
Rusal has rejected three offers since October 2010 to sell its
holding, as billionaires  Vladimir Potanin  and Oleg Deripaska
battle to control the world’s largest nickel producer.  “Rusal minorities will once again be victims of
Deripaska’s hubris and he will reject the offer,” Julian
Rimmer, director of emerging-market sales at CF Global Trading
in  London , said in e-mailed comments today. “A much higher bid
is unrealistic in this environment” and Rusal shareholders will
suffer because the cash would help repay debt, he said.  Moscow-based Rusal’s debt totaled $11.3 billion at the end
of the first quarter, according to company filings.  To contact the reporter on this story:
