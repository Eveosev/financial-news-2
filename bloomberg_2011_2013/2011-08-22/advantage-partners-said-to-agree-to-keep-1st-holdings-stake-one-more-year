Advantage Partners LLP, the largest
shareholder in Japanese  software developer   1st Holdings Inc. (3644) ,
agreed to keep its 19 percent stake in the company for one more
year, two people familiar with the plan said.  Tokyo-based 1st Holdings plans to announce the agreement
today after the close of trading in  Japan , the people said,
asking not to be identified because the discussions are private.
Four other funds affiliated with Advantage Partners, which hold
about 13 percent of 1st Holdings, also agreed to keep their
shares for at least a year, the people said.  The agreement will give the Japanese software developer,
which began trading in December, time to search for a partner to
buy the stake, the people said.  Advantage Partners, which has been free to sell the shares
since May 30, agreed to extend the so-called lockup to ease
investor concerns the buyout firm may sell its holdings to the
market, the people said.  Shares of 1st Holdings fell 2.1 percent to 508 yen as of
1:32 p.m. on the Jasdaq market. The stock has fallen 19 percent
since its initial public offering price of 630 yen last year.  Hideyuki Inokuma, a spokesman at Advantage Partners, and
Takuya Shoji, a spokesman at 1st Holdings, declined to comment
on the lockup period.  In August, 1st Holdings raised its six-month profit
forecast 8.2 percent to 1.26 billion yen ($16 million).  To contact the reporters on this story:
