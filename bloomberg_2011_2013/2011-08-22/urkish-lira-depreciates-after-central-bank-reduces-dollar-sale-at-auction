The lira fell in Istanbul after the
central bank said it will sell fewer dollars for lira in an
auction today than it did previously.  The lira dropped 0.3 percent to 1.7935 per dollar at 11:29
a.m., reversing earlier gains. The central bank in Ankara said
it will sell $100 million today compared with the $140 million
it sold on Aug. 19.  “Foreign investors are buying foreign exchange for lira
after the volume in the auction came out lower than Friday’s
sale,”Murat Yardimci, head of trading at ING Bank AS in
Istanbul, said by telephone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
