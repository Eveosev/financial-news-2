Nuplex Industries Ltd. (NPX) , a New
Zealand resin manufacturer, rose the most in 12 months in
Wellington trading after full-year earnings were better than
analystsâ€™ and company expectations.  Net income rose 3.6 percent to NZ$66.5 million ($54 million)
in the year ended June 30 from NZ$64.2 million a year earlier,
the Auckland-based company said today. Profit beat the NZ$60.5
million average estimate of analysts and the NZ$65 million
forecast the company published in May.  Nuplex, which sells resins used in paints and construction
materials, said it was able to recover about 90 percent of
higher raw material costs through price rises as European and
Asian markets recovered. The company is building new plants in
Vietnam and  China  and reducing other costs at its existing
factories, it said.  The stock closed 6.8 percent higher at NZ$2.53, the biggest
gain since Aug. 26 last year after earlier surging as much as 11
percent. Before today, the stock had slumped 33 percent this
year.  Full-year operating profit, or earnings before interest,
tax, depreciation and amortization, fell 6.1 percent to NZ$130.9
million, better than the NZ$125 million to NZ$129 million range
forecast in May.  To contact the reporter on this story:
