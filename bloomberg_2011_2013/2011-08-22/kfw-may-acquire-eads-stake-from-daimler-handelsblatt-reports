German government officials are
arguing about whether state-owned development bank KfW Group
should acquire a stake in European Aeronautic, Defence & Space
Co. from  Daimler AG (DAI)  as the carmaker pushes to cut its holding,
 Handelsblatt  reported, citing people familiar with the matter.  While Chancellor Angela Merkel would like KfW to buy the
stake, the Economy Ministry, headed by the Free Democratic
Party, the junior coalition partner, opposes such a step, the
newspaper reported.  The government is also urging banks that hold EADS stakes
already to consider buying more shares, and may consider selling
a stake to investors form the Gulf region, according to
Handelsblatt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
