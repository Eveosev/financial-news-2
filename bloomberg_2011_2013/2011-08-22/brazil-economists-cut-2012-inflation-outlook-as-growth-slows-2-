Economists covering the Brazilian
economy cut their forecast for 2012 inflation for a third
straight week as the economy shows signs of cooling and raw
materials costs fall on slower global growth.  Consumer prices will rise 5.2 percent next year, according
to the median forecast in an Aug. 19  central bank survey  of
about 100 economists published today. The figure was down from a
forecast of 5.23 percent the previous week.  “There’s a reassessment of global growth, with clear
downside added to global demand and commodity prices,” said
 Gustavo Rangel , chief Brazil economist for ING Financial Markets
in  New York , in response to an e-mailed question. “There is
also incipient evidence that the Brazilian economy is really
decelerating.”  Economists expect the central bank to hold its benchmark
interest rate unchanged at 12.5 percent at its August policy
meeting, bringing to a close the tightening cycle that began in
January. Policy makers are likely to adopt a “wait-and-see”
policy, while they assess the impact of the global slowdown on
 Brazil , Rangel said.  The central bank will hold rates at 12.5 percent until the
end of 2012, the survey found.  Slower Job Growth  Brazil’s economic activity shrank in June for the first
time since December, 2008. Job growth in July was lower than all
10 forecasts in a Bloomberg survey of economists. Industrial
production fell 1.6 percent in June, the second-biggest drop in
output since 2008, and business confidence in the second quarter
slid to its lowest level since 2009.  This year, prices as measured by the IPCA index will rise
6.28 percent, the survey found, from a forecast of 6.26 percent
the previous week. The central bank targets inflation of 4.5
percent, plus or minus two percentage points.  Economists cut their forecast for 2011 economic growth to
3.84 percent, from 3.93 percent a week earlier, and held their
2012 growth forecast unchanged at 4 percent.  The yield on the  interest rate  futures contract maturing in
January 2013, the most traded in  Sao Paulo  today, rose two basis
points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 11.48 percent at 8:26 a.m.
New York time.  Consumer prices rose 7.1 percent in the year through mid-
August, from 6.75 percent the previous month, the national
statistics agency said last week. Prices gained 0.27 percent
from the previous month, more than the median forecast of 0.19
percent in a Bloomberg survey of 38 analysts.  Commodity prices have fallen 6.5 percent this month,
according to the Standard & Poor’s GSCI Index.  To contact the reporters on this story:
