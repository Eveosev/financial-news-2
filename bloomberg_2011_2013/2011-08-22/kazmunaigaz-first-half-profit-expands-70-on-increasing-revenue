KazMunaiGaz National Co., the Kazakh
government-controlled energy producer, said first-half profit
increased 70 percent to 246.2 billion tenge ($1.7 billion).  Revenue rose 25 percent to 1.34 trillion tenge in the first
half from a year earlier, the Astana-based company said, citing
preliminary consolidated results in an e-mailed statement today.  KazMunaiGaz produced 10.7 million metric tons of oil in the
period, little changed from a year earlier, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
