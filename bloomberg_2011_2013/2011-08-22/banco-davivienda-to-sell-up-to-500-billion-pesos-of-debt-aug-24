Banco Davivienda SA (PFDAVVND) ,  Colombia â€™s
third-biggest bank, will offer as much as 500 billion pesos
($281 million) of bonds in the local market on Aug. 24.  The Bogota-based lender will offer 400 billion pesos of the
securities and make an additional 100 billion pesos available if
there is sufficient demand, Alianza Valores SA, which is helping
manage the sale, said in a report today. Davivienda will offer
22-month securities linked to the IBR interbank rate and 43-,
85- and 126-month debt linked to inflation, according to the
report.  The Bogota-based bank had initially planned to sell peso
bonds Aug. 10 and delayed the offer because of the turmoil in
global markets.  To contact the reporter on this story:
