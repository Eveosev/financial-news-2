Nigerian police rescued the abducted
father of Chelsea soccer player John Obi Mikel today in the
country’s northern city of Kano, Magaji Musa, a spokesman said.  Six people were arrested on suspicion of involvement in the
abduction of Michael Obi 10 days ago in the central city of Jos,
Nusa said by phone from the city..  Obi, who was freed when police raided a house in Kano, is
in good health, “though showing signs of fatigue,” the police
official said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
