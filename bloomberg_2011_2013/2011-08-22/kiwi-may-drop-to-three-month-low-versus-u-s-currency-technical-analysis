The euro may extend its decline
against the yen beyond the decade low reached today as momentum
indicators suggest its downward path is intact, according to
Forecast Pte.  The trend for the euro’s weekly moving average
convergence/divergence, or MACD, “is definitely still down,”
said Forecast technical analyst Pak Lai Ng. The currency’s MACD
was at minus 1.8267 versus the yen today, less than the signal
line of negative 1.6881, Bloomberg data showed. A reading below
the signal line signals weakness.  The euro traded at 101.25 yen as of 12:07 p.m. in  Tokyo 
from 100.97 in  New York  yesterday, after earlier falling to
100.76, the least since June 2001. It may slide to as low as
96.84 yen, a level last seen on Dec. 11, 2000, Ng said.  “Euro-yen still looks very weak,” Singapore-based Ng
said. “The first target will be at the 100 level. After that,
it may drop to around the 99 level, and then to the Dec. 11,
2000 low.”  Successive, weekly lows reached by the euro are further
evidence that it will depreciate further, Ng said. The shared
currency slid for a fifth-straight week in the five days ending
Sept. 30, finishing at 103.12 yen.  MACD is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential
moving average from the 12-day average. The signal line is a
nine-day exponential moving average of the MACD, and provides
buy and sell signals. In  technical analysis , investors and
