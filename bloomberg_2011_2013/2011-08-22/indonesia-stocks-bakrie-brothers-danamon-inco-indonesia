Shares of the following companies
had unusual moves in Indonesian trading. Stock symbols are in
parentheses, and prices are as of the 4 p.m. Jakarta-time close.  The  Jakarta Composite index (JCI)  slipped 3.13 points, or 0.1
percent, to 3,839.62, falling for a second day.  PT Bank Danamon Indonesia (BDMN IJ), owned by Singapore
state-owned investment company Temasek Holdings Pte and Deutsche
Bank AG, declined 3.9 percent to 5,000 rupiah, extending its 4.6
percent drop on Aug. 19. Danamon said today it plans to sell new
shares for 4,300 rupiah each in a rights offer next month.
That’s at the lower end of the 4,100- to 4,800-rupiah price
target and 17 percent less than Danamon’s last closing price.  PT Bumi Resources (BUMI IJ), Indonesia’s largest coal
producer, fell 3.7 percent to 2,600 rupiah, the biggest drag on
the Jakarta Mining Index. The shares retreated on concern a plan
to pay down debt will be delayed as it remained unclear when the
company will go ahead with a $2.1 billion sale of its mining
unit, said Adrianus Bias Prasuryo, an analyst at PT Samuel
Sekuritas  Indonesia .  Bumi Director Dileep Srivastava said the company maintains
its schedule to pay down $600 million of its debt this year.  PT Semen Gresik (SMGR IJ), Indonesia’s biggest cement
producer, rose 2.8 percent to 9,050 rupiah, the largest increase
since April 1. Semen Gresik may invest $150 million to build a
cement plant in Papua to strengthen supply for eastern
Indonesia, Investor Daily reported, citing Dwi Soetjipto,
president director at the company. Soetjipto couldn’t be reached
when called at his office in Jakarta.  To contact the reporter on this story:
