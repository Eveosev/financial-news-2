Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN)  has added $2.25
million to an effort to void a California law requiring online
retailers to collect sales taxes on purchases by state
residents, a campaign-finance  filing  shows.  Amazon, the world’s biggest Internet retailer, started the
More Jobs Not Taxes campaign committee with a $3 million
contribution in July. The Seattle-based company donated the
additional amount on Aug. 10, according to the Aug. 19 filing.
The company is the only reported donor to the committee.  The committee is gathering signatures to authorize a June
2012 referendum on overturning the law, which was signed June
29. The campaign needs almost 505,000 signatures from California
voters by Sept. 27 to qualify for the ballot.  Retailers including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT) , the world’s
largest, oppose the Amazon-led repeal effort. There is no record
of any contributions to an anti-repeal campaign, according to
the secretary of state’s website.  Ned Wigglesworth, a spokesman for More Jobs Not Taxes,
declined to comment on how the committee plans to spend its
money. It hasn’t filed expenditure reports, according to the
secretary of state’s website.  A 1992 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allows states to require
retailers to collect sales taxes only if they have a physical
presence in the state. After the California law passed, Amazon
severed ties with about 10,000 California-based website
operators that sell products through Amazon.  To contact the reporter on this story:
