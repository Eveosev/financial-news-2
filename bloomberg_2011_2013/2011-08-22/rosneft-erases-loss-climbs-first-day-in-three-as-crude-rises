OAO Rosneft,  Russia â€™s largest oil
company, advanced for the first day in three as crude rebounded
in  New York .  The shares rose 0.4 percent to 199.94 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier decline of as much as
2.4 percent.  Crude for October delivery gained 77 cents to $83.03 a
barrel in New York, after earlier falling as much as $1.13 as
investors bet that Libyan production may recover after rebels
entered the capital city Tripoli in a push to force out Muammar
Qaddafi.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
