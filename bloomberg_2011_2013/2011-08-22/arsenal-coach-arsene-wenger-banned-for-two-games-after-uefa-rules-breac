Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  has
been banned from the club’s next two matches in European
competition after a  UEFA  panel ruled he’d breached a previous
one game ban.  European soccer’s governing body said the Frenchman flouted
its rules by communicating with his team when he was serving a
suspension during last week’s 1-0 victory over Udinese in a
Champions League playoff match. Wenger was only granted
permission to watch the games from the stand, UEFA said.  The Arsenal manager was serving the touchline ban for
comments made about a referee after his team was eliminated in
the round of 16 by champion Barcelona last season. Wenger will
be suspended for the return match against Udinese in two days as
well as the Gunners’ next European game. The team has also been
fined 10,000 euros ($14,400) for “improper conduct by its
officials,”  UEFA  said.  Arsenal and Wenger have three days to appeal the decision.  To contact the reporter on this story:
