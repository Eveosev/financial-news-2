Center Riki Fluteyhas missed out on
a place in  England ’s 30-man squad for the Rugby World Cup in his
native  New Zealand  starting next month.  Flutey’s Wasps teammate Joe Simpson has made the squad,
which was announced tonight by the Rugby Football Union. His
call-up follows a reshuffle made necessary by an injury to
scrum-half  Danny Care , which put him out of the tournament.  Jonny Wilkinson is set for his fourth World Cup and scrum-
half Simpson is the only uncapped player. Simon Shaw, 37, is the
oldest squad member and Manu Tuilagi, 20, the youngest.  Lewis Moody will captain the side, which faces  Argentina 
(Sept. 10), Georgia (Sept. 18), Romania (Sept. 24) and Scotland
(Oct. 1) in the pool stages.  Eleven players featured in previous tournaments, five were
World Cup winners in 2003, and eight appeared in the 2007 final,
a 15-6 loss to  South Africa .  “We think we have the right mix in this group,” England
manager  Martin Johnson  said in a release from the RFU. “There
were some very tough phone calls made last week. Everybody came
into this camp and worked extremely hard and some players have
just missed out.”  The tournament begins in New Zealand on Sept. 10.  To contact the reporter on this story:
