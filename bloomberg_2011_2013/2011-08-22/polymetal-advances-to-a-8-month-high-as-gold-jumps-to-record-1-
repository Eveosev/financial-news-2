OAO Polymetal, the Russian gold and
silver producer, climbed to its highest since December after
gold increased to a record.  The shares surged 7.1 percent to 608 rubles by the 6:45
p.m. close in Moscow, the highest since Dec. 7.  Gold climbed to a record above $1,890 an ounce in  London 
and  New York  as concern about slowing economic growth and debt
crises spurred demand for bullion as a haven for wealth.
Platinum gained to a three-year high. Silver for immediate
delivery gained as much as 2.7 percent to $44.055 an ounce, the
highest price since May 3.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
