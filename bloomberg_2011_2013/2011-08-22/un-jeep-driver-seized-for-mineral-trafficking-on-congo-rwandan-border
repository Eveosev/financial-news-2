A United Nations jeep was seized and
its driver arrested for mineral trafficking after it was found
in Goma, on the border of the Democratic Republic of Congo and
 Rwanda , carrying 1,200 kilograms (2,645 pounds) of tin ore.  “This incident calls into question the conformity of
certain officials in the UN mission with the pertinent Security
Council resolutions regarding their presence in DRC and
Congolese laws,” the country’s Minister of Communication
Lambert Mende said in an e-mailed statement.  The Congolese driver was arrested last night, it said.  Congo is the largest tin-ore supplier in  Africa  and fifth
biggest in the world. The illicit mineral trade in eastern Congo
has helped fuel a conflict that began in the mid-1990s. The UN
mission in Congo has more than 20,000 members and has been
active in the country for more than a decade. UN mission
spokesman Madnodje Mounoubai didn’t answer his phone.  To contact the reporter on this story:
