Speculators increased bullish bets
on agricultural commodities by the most in a month after a U.S.
heat wave increased speculation crops were damaged, adding to
mounting concern that global supply will fall short of demand.  Hedge funds  and other speculators raised their net-long
positions across 11 agricultural futures and options by 6.7
percent to 675,561 contracts in the week through Aug. 16, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Bets on soybeans
rose 25 percent and those on corn 9.6 percent. Wagers that wheat
prices will decline were cut by the most in a month.  Combined global stockpiles of rice, corn and wheat will
drop 2.5 percent by the end of the harvests, to the lowest in
five years, the U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates.
 Barclays Capital  anticipates the biggest shortfall in soybean
production in four years while Texas, the biggest grower of U.S.
cotton, is enduring its most costly drought ever.  “We haven’t had overly beneficial weather and that’s
leading to reductions in production,” said Keith Flury, an
analyst at Rabobank in London. “There is a fundamental reason
why these prices are elevated and investors are seeing they can
get returns they can’t get in equities and bonds.”  Corn futures jumped 68 percent in the past year and
soybeans surged 37 percent, helping to drive the  United Nations ’
world food-price index to a record in February.  Wheat Stockpiles  World wheat stockpiles are expected to fall 1.5 percent to
188.9 million metric tons as output trails use by 0.4 percent,
according to the USDA. Inventories in the U.S., the world’s
biggest shipper of the grain, may drop 22 percent, government
data show.  Global corn inventories will drop 6.8 percent to 114.5
million tons in the 2011-12 marketing year as consumption
outpaces production by 1 percent, USDA data show. Soybean
stockpiles will fall 11 percent to 61 million tons as production
falls 2.5 percent, government data show.  Agricultural losses from a drought in Texas reached a
record $5.2 billion and may worsen without more rain,  Texas 
AgriLife Extension Service, a unit of  Texas A&M University , said
this month. Texas is the biggest U.S. cotton producer and third-
largest grower of winter wheat.  European wheat production will fall 1.6 percent to 133.5
million tons and stockpiles will drop 4.4 percent to 11.3
million tons after the driest growing season in three decades
cut yields. Drought has hit 68.1 million mu of cropland in  China 
as of Aug. 15, according to the  Agriculture Ministry .  Global arabica coffee production will fall 6.6 percent as
 Brazil , the world’s biggest producer of the beans, will drop 17
percent, USDA data show. Cocoa output for the 2011-12 season
will exceed demand by 93,000 tons after a surplus of 227,000
tons in the current season, VM Group estimated last month.  Global cotton output will be 122.71 million bales in the
2011-12 season, started Aug. 1, exceeding consumption of 115
million bales, USDA data show. Production in the U.S. will fall
8.6 percent because of the Texas drought, the USDA estimated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
