The ruble weakened against the
dollar, paring last week’s gains, as oil fell on bets Libyan
production may recover after rebels entered the capital,
Tripoli, in a push to force out leader  Muammar Qaddafi .  Russia’s currency lost 0.2 percent to 29.10 per dollar at
the 7 p.m. close in Moscow, after gaining 0.7 percent last week.
The ruble was little changed at 41.8525 per euro, leaving it
steady at 34.8386 against the central bank’s target dollar-euro
basket.  Brent crude  dropped 1.2 percent to $107.29 a barrel in
 London  on speculation the rebels’ advances put an end to supply
disruption in the oil-rich North African nation. Libya’s output
declined to 100,000 barrels a day last month, a Bloomberg News
survey showed, less than 10 percent of the 1.59 million barrels
the nation pumped in January before the start of the uprising.  “The unrest in Libya is putting additional pressure on
 market sentiment  about the ruble, via its impact on  oil
prices ,” Carolin Hecht, an emerging-markets currency strategist
at Commerzbank AG in Frankfurt, said by e-mail.  Market expectations that Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S.
Bernanke may announce a third round of asset purchases to boost
the  U.S. economy  in a speech at Jackson Hole Aug. 26 are also
holding back the ruble, Hecht said.  The speech may “entail QE3 measures, which may well cause
a fundamental reassessment,” Hecht said. “Therefore it’s even
more unlikely that market participants will expand their
positions in the ruble in this current environment.”  Forwards  Non-deliverable forwards show the currency at 29.4155 per
dollar in three months, compared with 29.335 Aug. 19. The
contracts provide a guide to expectations of currency movements
and interest-rate differentials and allow companies to hedge
against currency shifts.  The ruble has climbed 4.9 percent against the dollar so far
in 2011, beating all three of its peers in the so-called BRIC
group of emerging-market countries.  Brazil ’s real gained 3.6
percent against the greenback,  China ’s yuan appreciated 3.2
percent and India’s rupee lost 2.1 percent.  The extra yield investors demand to hold Russian government
dollar debt rather than U.S. Treasuries fell six basis points to
282, according to JPMorgan Chase & Co.’s EMBI Global indexes.
The difference dropped five basis points to 397 for Kazakhstan
and declined nine basis points to 563 for Ukraine.  Russia’s domestic OFZ bonds climbed, pushing the yield on
ruble-denominated notes due 2021 down 10 basis points, or 0.1
percentage point, to 7.94 percent. The yield on debt due August
2016 slipped six basis points to 7.54 percent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
