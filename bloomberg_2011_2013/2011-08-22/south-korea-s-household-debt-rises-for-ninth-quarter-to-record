South Korea’s  household debt  rose
from April through June for a ninth straight quarter to a record
even as the central bank raised interest rates three times this
year to quell inflation.  Household credit, the sum of loans and credit purchases,
climbed 18.9 trillion won ($17.4 billion) to a record 876.3
trillion won in the three months ended June 30 from the previous
quarter, the Bank of Korea said in Seoul today. From a year
earlier, household debt gained 9.1 percent.  The Bank of Korea left borrowing costs unchanged for a
second month on Aug. 11 as the U.S. rating downgrade and
Europe’s debt woes dimmed the outlook for Asian exports. South
Korea faces increasing risks to growth and inflation due to the
global turmoil, Finance Minister Bahk Jae Wan said today.  “Still-low  interest rates  are encouraging people to take
out more loans, adding pressure on the BOK to raise rates
further,” Lim Ji Won, an economist at  JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM)  in
Seoul, said before the report. “Still, the BOK faces a bigger
dilemma over more rate hikes as global uncertainties remain.”  Shinhan Bank , the lending unit of South Korea’s largest
financial services company by market value, halted some mortgage
lending this month to rein in an increase in household debt.  Financial regulators denied a report last week that they
sent out letters requesting that local banks limit household
loan growth to less than 0.6 percent from the previous month’s
balance.  The government changed rules in June to encourage banks to
cut lending in floating-rate loans.  To contact the reporter on this story:
