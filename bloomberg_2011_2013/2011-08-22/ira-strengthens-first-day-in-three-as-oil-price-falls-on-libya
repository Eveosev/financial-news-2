Turkish bond yields rose on
speculation that the central bank will keep rates on hold, as a
weak lira discourages it from cutting rates to a new record low.  Yields on two-year benchmark debt increased five basis
points, or 0.05 percentage points, to 7.89 percent at the 5 p.m.
close in Istanbul.  The central bank may keep the one-week repo lending rate at
a historic low at its second policy meeting this month after a
surprise cut at an unscheduled meeting three weeks earlier drove
the lira weaker. Governor Erdem Basci will hold the rate at 5.75
percent, according to 15 of 18 economists surveyed by Bloomberg.
Three forecast a reduction. The bank will announce its decision
at 2 p.m. in Ankara tomorrow.  “It appears more likely that the bank will be scared by
the fall in the lira and not cut rates,” Erkin Isik, a fixed-
income strategist at the Turk Ekonomi Bankasi AS in Istanbul,
said in e-mailed comments.  Yields fell 25 basis points last week on bets that the
central bank will cut rates after  Germany ’s gross domestic
product missed estimates in the first quarter, fueling concern
about the economic slowdown in  Europe .  The lira fell for a third day, dropping less than 0.1
percent to 1.7885 per dollar and extending this year’s fall to
14 percent, making it the worst performer among emerging market
currencies.  To contact the reporter on this story:
