Essar Energy Plc (ESSR) , an Indian energy
company, dropped to a record low in London trading on delays in
setting up  power plants  and gaining approval for coal projects.  The company fell 3.8 percent to 247.9 pence, the lowest
since its shares first traded in London on May 4, 2010. Essar
said regulators stalled approval of some coal-bed methane
projects, which generate natural gas from coal fields. Work on
three power plants including  India ’s Vadinar was delayed even as
the company reported an 84 percent increase in earnings.  “Power projects are delayed one to two quarters,” James Brand, an analyst at Deutsche Bank AG, said in a note. “We see
the results as disappointing, with more delays announced, less
disclosure now on timing of project commissioning, higher cost
guidance in refining and limited reassurance on fuel sourcing.”  The delays risk hindering plans by Chief Executive Officer
Naresh Nayyar to double power capacity to 9,670 megawatts by the
end of March 2014, as well as boost refining capabilities as the
Indian economy grows at about 8 percent a year. The company said
it’s hoping to receive the coal-bed methane approvals “soon.”  Essar is also awaiting approval to clear three coal blocks
to provide fuel for the Mahan I and Tori power stations.  Profit after tax was $206.2 million compared with $111.9
million a year earlier, it said in a statement today. Essar
bought Royal Dutch Shell Plc’s Stanlow refinery in the U.K. this
year for $350 million.  To contact the reporter on this story:
