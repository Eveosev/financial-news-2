Swiss stocks climbed for the first
day in three as European health-care companies advanced.  Roche Holding AG , the world’s biggest maker of cancer
drugs, climbed 2 percent.  Actelion Ltd. (ATLN) , Switzerland’s largest
biotechnology company, rallied 3 percent.  Sonova Holding AG (SOON) , the
hearing-aid maker, gained 2.4 percent.  The  Swiss Market Index (SMI) , a measure of the biggest and most
actively traded companies, rose 0.7 percent to 5,126.86 at 10:10
a.m. in Zurich. The gauge has still tumbled 24 percent from this
year’s high on Feb. 18 amid concern that the global economic
recovery is stalling, while European leaders struggled to
contain the region’s sovereign-debt crisis. The broader Swiss
Performance Index added 0.4 percent today.  To contact the reporter responsible for this story:
