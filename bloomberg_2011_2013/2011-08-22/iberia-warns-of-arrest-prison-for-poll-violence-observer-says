     Aug. 22 (Bloomberg)--Liberian President Ellen Johnson- Sirleaf said those who plan to disrupt elections through
violence will be arrested and imprisoned, the Daily Observer
reported, citing Sirleaf.  The president made the comments in Gbarnga, about 165
kilometers (103 miles) north of the capital, Monrovia, after
recent attacks against senior members of the ruling United
Party, the newspaper said.  Sirleaf is seeking re-election in polls that may take place
in October or November.  To contact the reporter on this story:
