At least 23 people died in
southeastern  Kenya  when a bus carrying a wedding party,
including the groom and relatives, crashed, the  Daily Nation 
reported, citing Bernard Mutune, a spokesman for the family.  The vehicle was traveling down a hill toward Kangundo near
Machakos, about 56 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Nairobi,
the capital, when it fell off a bridge, rolled and landed on its
roof on a riverbed, the newspaper said.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
