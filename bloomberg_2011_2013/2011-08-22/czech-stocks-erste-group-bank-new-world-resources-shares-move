The Czech Republic’s PX stock index
rose 1.1 percent to 999.6 at its 4:28 p.m. close in Prague,
snapping a two-day retreat.  The following were among the most active equities on the
Prague Stock Exchange today. Stock symbols follow company names.  Erste Group Bank AG (RBAG)   slumped 2.1 percent to 569
koruna, its lowest close in more than two years. The Austrian
lender had the price estimate for its Vienna-traded shares cut
to 32 euros from 36 euros at Deutsche Bank AG.  Komercni Banka AS (KOMB)   increased 3.2 percent to 3,180
koruna, snapping a two-day decline. U.S. and European stocks
rose on speculation the  Federal Reserve  may act to stimulate the
world’s largest economy.  New World Resources Plc (NWR CP), the largest Czech coking-
coal producer, rose 1.6 percent to 161 koruna. The stock lost
7.3 percent in the previous two sessions, pushing the 14-day
relative strength index to 25 at the end of last week. Readings
lower than 30 suggest to technical analysts that a security or
an index may rise. The RSI for NWR increased to 28 today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
