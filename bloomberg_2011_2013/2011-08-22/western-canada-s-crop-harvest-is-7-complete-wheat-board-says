Western Canada’s harvest of all
crops is 7 percent complete, behind the 12 percent normal pace
for this time of year, the Canadian Wheat Board said.  Temperatures last week were 1 degree to 4 degrees Celsius
below normal in the west, and as much as 3.5 centimeters (1.4
inches) of rain fell in eastern and central Saskatchewan, the
board said today in a  statement  on its website. The harvest is
furthest behind in  Alberta , the board said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
