Sweden ’s  Green Party  said it wants
to negotiate with Prime Minister Fredrik Reinfeldt’s minority
government over future budgets.  The Greens, Sweden’s second-largest opposition party, want
to invest more in education, infrastructure and housing, leaders
Asa Romson and Gustav Fridolin wrote in an opinion piece
published in Dagens Nyheter newspaper on Aug. 20. While still
opposed to more income-tax cuts, the Green leaders signaled that
they may support further reductions as part of a compromise.  The opposition’s willingness to discuss future budgets
might make it easier for Reinfeldt to push more tax cuts through
parliament beyond next year. Reinfeldt said last week that he
wants to postpone an income-tax cut originally planned for next
year, the fifth since 2006, after the government said it will
have to “significantly” revise down its economic forecasts.  Reinfeldt said Aug. 20 that he still wants to lower value-
added tax on restaurant and catering services next year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
