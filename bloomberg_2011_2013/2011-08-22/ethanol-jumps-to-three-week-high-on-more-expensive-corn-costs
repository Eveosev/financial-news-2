Ethanol futures jumped to a three-
week high in  Chicago  on concern higher corn prices will lead to
more expensive production costs.  Futures gained for the 11th time in 12 days amid
speculation that rain in the corn-rich Midwest isn’t enough to
offset sweltering heat that blanketed the region in July and may
have hindered crop development. The grain is the primary input
for ethanol made in the U.S.  “Ethanol just followed corn higher,” said Ian Jackson, a
trader at SCB & Associates LLC in Chicago.  ‘Corn is the best
correlation for it. There’s continued concern over the kernel
size as well as the weather.’’  Denatured ethanol for September delivery climbed 2.2 cents,
or 0.8 percent, to $2.856 a gallon on the Chicago Board of
Trade. Futures are up 20 percent this year.  In cash market trading ethanol in  New York  gained 5 cents,
or 1.7 percent, to $2.975 a gallon and in Chicago the additive
rose 3.5 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $2.875, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Ethanol in the U.S. Gulf increased 2.5 cents, or 0.9
percent, to $2.96 a gallon and on the West Coast the biofuel
advanced 1.5 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $3.01.  Corn futures for December delivery rose 9.25 cents, or 1.3
percent, to settle at $7.345 a bushel in Chicago. The grain is
up 68 percent in the past year.  The profit from turning a bushel of corn into 2.75 gallons
of ethanol, or the so-called crush margin, was 23 cents today,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
