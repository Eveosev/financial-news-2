Russian stocks slid for a third day,
heading for the lowest close in almost a year, as oil dropped on
bets Libyan supplies of the commodity may rise.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  fell 1.5 percent to 1,417.74 as of 11:04
a.m. in Moscow, a third day of declines. A close at that level
would be the lowest since September 2010. OAO Rosneft and OAO
Lukoil,  Russia ’s two largest oil producers, sank 1.3 percent and
0.7 percent, respectively. OAO Sberbank, the country’s biggest
lender, lost 2.2 percent. The dollar-denominated RTS Index
dropped two percent to 1,543.87.  Brent crude  retreated 3 percent to $105.35 a barrel in
 London  on speculation the Libyan rebels’ advances would put an
end to supply disruption in the oil-rich North African nation.
 Libya ’s output declined to 100,000 barrels a day last month, a
Bloomberg News survey showed, less than 10 percent of the 1.59
million barrels the nation pumped in January before the start of
the uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
