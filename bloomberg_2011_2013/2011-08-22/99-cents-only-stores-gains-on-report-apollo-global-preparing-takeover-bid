99 Cents Only Stores (NDN)  rose 8.6
percent following a report that Apollo Global Management LLC
will make an offer for the deep-discount retail chain.  99 Cents Only advanced $1.42 to $18 at 4:01 p.m. in New
York Stock Exchange composite trading. The shares have gained 13
percent this year.  The private equity firm has been courting the company’s
founding Schiffer-Gold family and plans to make an offer, the
New York Post  reported  yesterday.  Leonard Green & Partners LP and the founding family, which
owns 33 percent of 99 Cents Only’s stock, made an offer in March
to take the City of Commerce, California-based company private
for $19.09 a share, valuing it at $1.34 billion. With Apollo
preparing to make a bid, the Schiffer-Gold family is now
considering supporting the highest bidder, the newspaper said.  99 Cents Only has set a bidding deadline for this week, the
Post reported, citing a person it didn’t identify.  Dollar stores have become takeover targets in the U.S.
after luring shoppers away from traditional retail chains
including  Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT)   Family Dollar Stores Inc. (FDO) 
rejected an unsolicited bid by  Nelson Peltz ’s Trian Fund
Management LP in March, saying it undervalues its business.  Charles Zehren , a spokesman for Apollo, and Angela Thurstan, a spokeswoman for 99 Cents Only, declined to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
