The Australian and  New Zealand 
dollars advanced versus their U.S. counterpart after a private
report showed China’s manufacturing shrank at a slower pace this
month, easing concern the global recovery is losing momentum.  “The data flow across the globe has been quite weak
recently, so even a secondary indicator like this that comes out
stronger than expected can have some impact,”  Todd Elmer , head
of Group-of-10 currency strategy for Asia ex-Japan at Citigroup
Inc. in  Singapore .  Australia’s dollar advanced 0.9 percent to $1.0505 at 12:02
p.m. in  New York , from $1.0409 yesterday, after falling as low
as $1.0387. New Zealand’s currency increased 1.3 percent to
83.47 U.S. cents, from 82.42, after touching 83.48, the highest
level since Aug. 18.  The currencies got a boost as a rally in stocks encouraged
demand for higher-yielding assets. The Standard & Poor’s 500
Index increased 1.5 percent. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index climbed
2.1 percent in its first advance in four days.  A preliminary gauge of  China  manufacturing in August was
49.8, according to a reading of the Purchasing Managers’ Index
reported by HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics today. That
compares with a final reading for July of 49.3. An index above
50 means the number of manufacturers who said conditions
improved was greater than the number saying they deteriorated.  To contact the reporters on this story:
