Romania ’s wheat harvest increased 23
percent to 7.12 million metric tons this year on favorable
weather that boosted grain quality, Agriculture Minister Valeriu Tabara said.  Wheat was planted on almost 2 million hectares (4.9 million
hectares), and about 99 percent of harvesting is complete,
Tabara said in a phone interview today. The wheat crop last year
was 5.77 million tons, according to the ministry. This year’s
crop was estimated by the ministry at 7 million tons in May.  Romania is seeking to take advantage of higher
international grains prices and boost exports, and there are
plans to put 4 million tons of wheat in reserve for overseas
shipments, Tabara said.  “The corn harvest looks also very good and will most
likely exceed 10 million tons, more than the 9 million tons
harvested last year,” Tabara said. “The sunflower seeds output
will also rise to about 1.6 million tons from 1.3 million tons
last year.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
