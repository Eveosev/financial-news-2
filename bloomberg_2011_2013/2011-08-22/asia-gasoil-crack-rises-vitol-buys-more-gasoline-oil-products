Asia ’s gasoil crack spread rose the
most in a week, signaling increased profit for refiners. Vitol
Group extended its gasoline purchases in  Singapore , the region’s
biggest oil-trading center.  Middle Distillates  The premium of gasoil, or diesel, to Asian benchmark Dubai
crude climbed 73 cents to $18.74 a barrel at 2:14 p.m. Singapore
time, according to data from PVM Oil Associates Ltd., a broker.
The crack spread, a measure of processing profit, rose the most
since Aug. 15.  Royal Dutch Shell Plc sold 150,000 barrels of gasoil with
0.5 percent sulfur to Brightoil Petroleum Holdings Ltd., based
on a Bloomberg News survey of traders monitoring transactions on
the Platts window. Shell,  Europe ’s largest oil company, paid 30
cents a barrel below benchmark quotes.  Jet fuel’s premium to gasoil fell for a second day, losing
5 cents to $2.15 a barrel, PVM said. A narrowing regrade shows
it is less profitable to produce  aviation fuel  over diesel.  Light Distillates  Vitol bought 50,000 barrels of 95-RON gasoline from Arcadia
Petroleum Ltd. at $120.40 a barrel, according to the Bloomberg
News survey. The Geneva-based trader purchased gasoline in
Singapore every day last week.  Naphtha’s premium to London-traded Brent crude futures
increased $19.06 to $121.97 a metric ton at 5 p.m. Singapore
time, based on Bloomberg data. This crack spread narrowed 3.6
percent last week.  Gasoline’s premium to naphtha on Aug. 19 dropped to $15.50
a barrel, the lowest in two weeks, Bloomberg calculations showed.
A narrowing reforming margin means motor fuel is less profitable
to produce.  Fuel Oil   Fuel oil’s discount to Dubai crude narrowed 26 cents to
$4.43 a barrel at 2:14 p.m. Singapore time, according to PVM.
That’s the smallest gap since Aug. 8 last year, signaling
reduced losses for refiners turning oil into residual products.  The premium of 180-centistoke fuel oil to 380-centistoke
rebounded 50 cents to $7.25 a ton, PVM said. This viscosity
spread narrowed 25 percent last week, the most since May 2010,
indicating bunker, or marine fuel, has dropped less than higher-
quality fuel oil.  To contact the reporter on this story:
