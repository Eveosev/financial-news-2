TNK-BP,  Russia ’s third-largest oil
producer, sold earlier this month two cargoes of East Siberian
Pacific Ocean pipeline oil, or ESPO crude, using price
assessments from Argus Media.  “This is the first time that spot trading activity is
known to have taken place using ESPO Blend assessments,” the
London-based energy news and pricing agency said today in a
statement on its  website .  In the past, the trades were done as a differential to the
Dubai assessment published by the energy news unit of McGraw-
Hill Cos.’ Platts, a pricing agency that competes with Argus.  Argus introduced the ESPO Blend assessments in its daily
report in December 2009, according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
