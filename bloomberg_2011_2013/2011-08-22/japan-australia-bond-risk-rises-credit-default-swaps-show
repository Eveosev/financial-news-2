The cost of protecting corporate
bonds in  Japan  and  Australia  from default increased, according
to traders of credit-default swaps.  The Markit iTraxx Japan index rose 1.5 basis points to
141.5 basis points as of 9:25 a.m. in  Tokyo , Deutsche Bank AG
prices show. The index, which fell last week to as low as 133.5
on Aug. 18, is on course for its highest close since March 31,
CMA prices in New York show. Five-year swaps on Japan’s
sovereign debt climbed 1 basis point to 108, Deutsche Bank
prices show.  The Markit iTraxx Australia index advanced 1 basis point to
164 as of 10:34 a.m. in Sydney, Credit Agricole CIB prices show.
The risk benchmark is headed for its highest level since July
23, 2009, according to CMA, which is owned by CME Group Inc. and
compiles prices quoted by dealers in the privately negotiated
market. The Australian index rose for a third day from last
week’s low of 145 basis points on Aug. 17.  The Markit iTraxx Asia index of 50 investment-grade
borrowers outside Japan decreased 1 basis point to 154 basis
points as of 8:34 a.m. in  Hong Kong , according to Credit
Agricole prices. That’s headed for a second daily decline after
rising to 153.8 basis points Aug. 18, CMA prices show.  Credit-default swap indexes are benchmarks for protecting
bonds against default and traders use them to speculate on
 credit quality . A drop signals improving perceptions of
creditworthiness, while an increase suggests the opposite.  The swap contracts pay the buyer face value in exchange for
the underlying securities if a borrower fails to meet its debt
agreements. A basis point is 0.01 percentage point.  To contact the reporter on this story:
