A curvy red 1957 Ferrari became the
most expensive car sold at auction, fetching $16.4 million at
Gooding & Co. on Aug. 20 and topping a weekend of sales in which
autos outshone equities.  The Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa prototype, which competed in
the  Le Mans  24-hour race, was on the block with hundreds of
other collectible autos during auctions coinciding with  Monterey
Car Week  in  California , an annual gathering of collectors and
other enthusiasts.  Despite the recent stock market turmoil, buyers competed
aggressively for trophy autos, establishing records for cars and
auction houses.  “The ultra-rich remain ultra-rich,” said Marcel Massini,
a Swiss-based Ferrari historian, who attended several auctions
last week. “The very, very best sells easy and incredibly
high.”  Gooding’s two-day sale brought in more than $78
million, beating its 2010 tally of $64.6 million. Sales at  RM
Auctions  totaled about $80 million, topping its previous high of
$67 million last year.  “The stock market being volatile almost helped us,” said
Max Girardo, managing director of RM Auctions in  Europe . “It
makes classic cars even more desirable” because they are seen
as safe tangible assets.  RM Auctions set a record for a Mercedes-Benz with the $9.7
million sale of a silver 1937 540 K Spezial Roadster. It was
consigned by Sam Mann, a collector from Englewood,  New Jersey .
The same model fetched $8.25 million four years ago, according
to Girardo.  ‘More Satisfaction’  “In an era when cash returns practically less than the
rate of inflation, investing in tangible assets like automobiles
brings you better returns,” said Dave Kinney, contributor to
 Automobile magazine . “And they give you more satisfaction.”  The top lot at  Bonhams , a 1957 BMW 507 Roadster with its
engine rebuilt by  Motion Products Inc. , sold for $1 million,
reaching its presale high estimate.  One of the star lots, a 1925 Rolls-Royce New Phantom,
custom-designed for the Bengal tiger hunting expeditions of
 India ’s Maharajah of Kotah, failed to sell. It was expected to
bring $750,000 to $1 million.  Also unsold was a 1963 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud III
Drophead Coupe owned by Sammy Davis Jr., which was expected to
bring between $475,000 and $550,000.  At Gooding, a 1931 Duesenberg, which was expected to fetch
as much as $7 million, sold for $10.34 million, topping the $4.5
million auction record for a “Duesy” and establishing a record
for a U.S. car at auction  A Pet Lion  The car was commissioned by Captain George Whittell Jr.,
who had a pet lion and a 40,000-acre Lake Tahoe estate. He
liquidated his entire stock portfolio for $50 million just two
weeks before the 1929 crash.  At RM Auctions, Steve McQueen’s slate-gray 1970 Porsche
911s, featured in the Hollywood film “Le Mans,” sold for $1.4
million, setting a record for the model at auction.  Gooding sold McQueen’s black 1931 Brough Superior SS80
motorcycle for $176,000, compared with the presale estimate of
$100,000 to $200,000.  Sheryl Crow’s 1959 Mercedes-Benz 190 SL Roadster, expected
to fetch $50,000 to $80,000, brought in $143,000. The proceeds
from the sale of this white convertible will benefit the
community of Joplin,  Missouri , which is recovering from a
devastating tornado in May.  An  Aston Martin  owned by  Peter Madoff , brother of Ponzi-
schemer Bernard L. Madoff, sold for $247,500 at RM Auctions. The
proceeds will be distributed among the investors who lost as
much as $19 billion in the financial fraud.  To contact the reporter of this story:
