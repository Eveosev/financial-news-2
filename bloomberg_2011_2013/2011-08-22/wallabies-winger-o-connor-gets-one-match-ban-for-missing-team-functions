Australia winger  James O’Connor  will
miss this weekend’s Tri-Nations rugby decider against  New
Zealand  after getting a one-game ban for missing two team
functions last week.  The Australian Rugby Union said it suspended O’Connor until
Aug. 28 for failing to attend the Wallabies’ official World Cup
photo shoot on Aug. 18 and the squad announcement later the same
day. O’Connor, 21, was asked to provide the Sydney-based
governing body with an explanation as to his non-attendance.  “A response was received earlier today and considered,
after which a decision was taken to suspend and fine O’Connor
for his indiscretion,” the ARU said in an e-mailed statement.  O’Connor was given a suspended fine of A$10,000 ($10,425),
which will remain in place until Dec. 31, 2012, the ARU added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
