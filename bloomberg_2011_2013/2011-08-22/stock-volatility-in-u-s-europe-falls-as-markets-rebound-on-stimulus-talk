The benchmark index for U.S. stock
options decreased as investors speculated the  Federal Reserve 
will signal additional measures to stimulate the economy.
Europe’s volatility gauge also retreated.  The VIX index, which measures Standard & Poor’s 500 Index
options prices, fell 1.4 percent to 42.44 as of 4:15 p.m. in New
York. Europe’s  VStoxx Index (V2X) , which measures prices for Euro
Stoxx 50 Index contracts, dropped 1.5 percent to close at 46.59
after earlier falling as much as 8 percent. The  S&P 500  rose
less than 0.1 percent and the Euro Stoxx 50 gained 1.1 percent.  Demand for options waned as equities recover from a four-
week rout that wiped out more than $8 trillion in global stock
values. Central bankers from around the world meet in  Jackson
Hole ,  Wyoming , this week. Record-low yields on U.S. Treasuries
show that traders expect Fed Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to signal
a third round of asset purchases.  “People think there’s a floor under the market because the
government is determined to do anything in its power to keep the
economy strong,” Andrew Keene, an independent options trader at
the  Chicago Board Options Exchange , said in a telephone
interview. “But volatility isn’t going to get crushed too much
because we’re still making huge moves in the market.”  The  Dow Jones Industrial Average  alternated between gains
and losses of more than 400 points for four days in a row
earlier this month, the longest streak ever. The S&P 500 has
moved in a 3.15 percentage-point average range between its
intraday high and low over the past month, more than double this
year’s 1.30 percentage-point average swing.  Debt Crisis  VIX futures rose across all maturities. September contracts
rose 3 percent to 36.40, while January’s increased 1.2 percent
to 30.05. The most-active VIX options were September $45 calls,
which rose 17 percent. VIX call volume of 193,039 exceeded the
154,681 puts changing hands.  Options prices surged from  Asia  to  Europe  and the U.S. last
week as traders snapped up protection on concern that the global
economy is stalling and that European banks lack sufficient
capital to survive the region’s debt crisis. The MSCI Asia
Pacific Index dropped 14 percent from July 22 to Aug. 19, while
the Stoxx 600 sank 18 percent in the same period and the S&P 500
tumbled 16 percent.  “People are pricing in a lot of turbulence and they’re
still fearful that economy won’t produce the jobs,” Greg Richards, an institutional options broker at Hybrid Trading LLC
on the CBOE floor. “We’re still seeing reasonable buyers in
crash puts.”  The VIX, as the CBOE Volatility Index is known, soared 50
percent to 48 on Aug. 8, the biggest surge since February 2007
and the highest level since March 2009, then down 27 percent the
next day for the second-largest drop. The VStoxx posted a record
streak of 11 straight gains through Aug. 10, when it rose to the
highest level since May 2010.  The VIX more than doubled in the past month and closed up
0.9 percent to 43.05 on Aug. 19. The average for the gauge has
been 20.38 through its 21-year history, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporters on this story:
