Batsman  Virender Sehwag  and pace
bowler Ishant Sharma will miss the forthcoming one-day cricket
series against England.  Sehwag has a hearing problem and Sharma has an ankle
ligament injury, the Board of Control for Cricket in  India  said
in a statement.  India is currently battling to save the fourth and final
Test match in a series where it trails 3-0. At midday on the
last day it was 173-3, still needing 118 runs to make England
bat again at the Oval in  London .  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
