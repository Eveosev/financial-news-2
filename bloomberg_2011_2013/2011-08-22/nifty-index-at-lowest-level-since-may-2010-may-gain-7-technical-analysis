India’s S&P CNX Nifty Index may
rebound 7 percent after falling to its lowest level in 15
months, according to  technical analysis  by Edelweiss Financial
Services Ltd. and  Angel Broking  Ltd.  The 50-stock measure will be supported at the 4,777.74
level, a 38.2 percent retracement from its Nov. 5 high of
6,338.50, and rebound to 5,200 to create a shoulder in a so-
called head-and-shoulders pattern, Tejas Shah, technical analyst
at Edelweiss, the nation’s the largest listed brokerage, said in
a telephone interview in Mumbai. The Nifty fell 2 percent on
Aug. 19 to 4,845.65, its lowest level since May 25, 2010.  “There is carnage in the street,” said Shardul Kulkarni,
a technical analyst with Angel Broking, who correctly predicted
in June a 14 percent decline in the index. “The Nifty is
looking oversold on the charts.”  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex, has
lost 21 percent this year, the worst performer after  Brazil ’s
Bovespa Index among benchmark gauges in the the world’s 10
biggest markets, on concern higher borrowing costs will slow
economic growth and erode earnings. Companies in the Sensex are
valued at 13.4 times estimated earnings, compared with a
multiple of 9.6 for the MSCI Emerging Markets Index.  Stocks have fallen the past month on concern the U.S.
economic recovery is faltering and  Europe ’s debt crisis will
worsen. The Sensex posted its fourth straight week of losses
last week, the longest losing streak since October 2008, when
the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. froze credit
markets.  Peaks, Valleys  A head-and-shoulders chart pattern occurs when a price
forms three consecutive peaks or valleys, the middle being the
largest. A breach of the neckline connecting the base of the
three peaks signals a possible bearish trend.  The highest peak, or “head,” was formed after the Nifty
rose to 6,338 on Nov. 5, Angel’s Kulkarni said. The “left
shoulder” took shape between February and May 2010, with the
index moving from 4,675 to 4,786. The measure has completed the
“right shoulder” by falling below the neckline at 5,300 and
moving to 4,800, he said.  “There is a likelihood that it may move towards the
neckline and test 5,050 or even 5,200 in the next few days
before the downtrend resumes again,” said Kulkarni.  In technical analysis, investors and analysts study charts
of trading patterns and prices to predict changes in a security,
commodity, currency or index.  -- Editors: Darren Boey,  Matthew Oakley   To contact the reporter on this story:
