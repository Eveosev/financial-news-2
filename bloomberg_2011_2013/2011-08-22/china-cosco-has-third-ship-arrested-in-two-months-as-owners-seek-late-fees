A  China  Cosco Holdings Co. vessel
was arrested at the request of Bunge SA, at least the third
attachment against China’s largest shipping company in two
months as owners seek late charter payments.  The Yu Lan Hai was detained as Geneva-based Bunge sought
$294,252 in fees plus costs from Cosco unit Cosco Bulk Carrier
Co., according to court documents. The ruling was granted by
Judge Helen G. Berrigan of the U.S. District Court, Eastern
District of Louisiana on Aug. 18.  The arrest followed another attachment in Louisiana earlier
this month and one in  Singapore  in July because of disputes
involving late payments. In each case, Tianjin, China-based
Cosco was locked into long-term contracts at rates higher than
market prices following a collapse in spot rates.  Bunge was owed money from Cosco’s use of another ship, the
Coal Gypsy, which was hired out in 2008 at rates of as much as
$67,000 a day until as late as Dec. 30, 2010, according to the
filings. The Coal Gypsy is an 82,295 deadweight-ton bulk carrier,
according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  China Cosco said last week in an e-mail to Bloomberg News
that the disputes were part of “normal operations.” It didn’t
elaborate further. A spokesman, who declined to be named, citing
company policy, referred back to that statement when called
today.  The case is Bunge SA v. Cosco Bulk Carrier Co., 2:11-cv-
02045-HGB-SS, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of
 Louisiana .  To contact the reporter on this story:
