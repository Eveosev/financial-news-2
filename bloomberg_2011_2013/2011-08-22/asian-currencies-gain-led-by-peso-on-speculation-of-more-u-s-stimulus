Asian currencies advanced, led by
the Philippine peso, on speculation the  Federal Reserve  will
unveil measures this week to revive growth in the world’s
biggest economy, improving the outlook for the region’s exports.  The Fed will hold its annual symposium at Jackson Hole,
Wyoming on Aug. 26. The Federal Open Market Committee is
“prepared to employ” additional tools to bolster the economy,
it said earlier this month, an indication that it may be
considering another round of bond-buying that expands the supply
of dollars, known as quantitative easing.  “The market is looking to the Fed for some kind of
temporary fix and confidence booster,” said Calbert Loh, head
of treasury at Bangkok Bank Bhd. in  Kuala Lumpur  “The slowdown
in developed markets is beginning to affect Asia.”  The peso rose 0.4 percent to 42.485 per dollar as of 4:43
p.m. in  Manila , according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  South
Korea ’s won gained 0.3 percent to 1083.88, Malaysia’s ringgit
climbed 0.3 percent to 2.9725 and the Singapore and  Taiwan 
dollars strengthened 0.2 percent to S$1.2086 and NT$29.020,
respectively.  The Taiwan dollar rebounded from a four-month low on
speculation exporters are taking advantage of recent declines to
repatriate earnings. Export orders increased 11.1 percent from a
year earlier in July, after a 9.2 percent gain the previous
month, government data showed on Aug. 19.  Taiwan Weathers Slowdown  “The NT$29 level is very attractive for exporters, we see
many of them selling the greenback,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at the Union Bank of Taiwan.
“The export orders figures show Taiwan hasn’t been affected
much by the global slowdown.”  Indonesia’s rupiah snapped a two-day decline on optimism
global investors will boost holdings of local assets to benefit
from growth in Southeast  Asia ’s largest economy. The currency
strengthened 0.2 percent to 8,546 per dollar.  Gross domestic product will rise 6.5 percent this year, the
most since 1998, President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono said last
week. The currency has advanced 5 percent in 2011 as offshore
funds bought $1.9 billion more Indonesian stocks than they sold
through Aug. 19, exchange data show.  “Positive sentiment toward the Indonesian economy is
supporting the currency,” said Lindawati Susanto, head of
treasury at PT Bank Resona Perdania in Jakarta.  Thailand’s GDP  Thailand’s baht weakened 0.1 percent to 29.84 per dollar
after a government report showed gross domestic product rose 2.6
percent in the three months through June from a year earlier,
following a 3 percent gain in the first quarter. The median
estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News was for a 3.6
percent advance.  “It’s understandable to see a slower growth in the second
quarter for countries relying on exports like  Thailand ,” said
Tohru Nishihama, an economist at Dai-ichi Life Research
Institute Inc. in  Tokyo . “Investors remain risk averse and
that’s supporting bonds.”  Elsewhere,  China ’s yuan declined 0.13 percent to 6.4013 per
dollar and  India ’s rupee dropped 0.2 percent to 45.8575.  To contact the reporter on this story:
