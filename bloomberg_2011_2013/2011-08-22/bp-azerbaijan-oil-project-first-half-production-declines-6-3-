(Corrects percentage in first paragraph.)  Crude oil production at  BP Plc (BP/) ’s
Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in the Azerbaijan sector of the
 Caspian Sea  declined by 5.9 percent in the first half from a
year earlier.  Output fell to 19 million metric tons, or 775,700 barrels a
day, BP said today in an e-mailed statement. That compares with
20.2 million tons in the same period the previous year,
according to the Turan news agency.  Tamam Bayatly, a BP spokeswoman, declined to provide
numbers for the previous year. BP is the field’s operator with a
35.78 percent share. State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, known as
Socar, as well as Chevron Corp., Statoil ASA and Exxon Mobil
Corp. are partners.  To contact the reporter on this story:
