Spanish soccer players may strike
for a second weekend after talks in  Madrid  between their union
and the league failed to reach an agreement today.  The union, known as AFE, is seeking a new labor agreement
that includes guarantees for unpaid salaries from clubs in
financial trouble. The two sides will consider the proposals
exchanged today and meet again tomorrow at 4 p.m. Madrid time,
the league said on its  website .  Players said Aug. 11 they’d strike the first two weeks of
the season if there was no agreement, a move the league called
“absolutely unjustified.”  The opening round of games in Spanish soccer’s top two
divisions, scheduled for last weekend, was postponed by the
strike after talks broke down. If the second week of the season
is called off, the earliest it could begin is Sept. 10 because
of a break for international matches.  A spokeswoman for the league, who couldn’t be identified
because of policy, said there’s some optimism that the second
round of games will go ahead. Juanjo Montaner, an AFE spokesman,
wasn’t available to comment.  To contact the reporter on this story:
