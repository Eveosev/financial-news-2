Renesola Ltd. (SOLA) , a Chinese maker of
solar products, rose the most in 11 days on plans to buy as much
as $100 million of its shares and the creation of a shareholder
rights plan to defend against a takeover bid.  Renesola advanced 5 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $3.04 at
11:55 a.m. in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. Earlier
it gained 12 percent, the biggest intra-day gain since Aug. 11.
The Jiashan, China-based company has fallen 65 percent this
year.  “We believe our shares are undervalued,” Xianshou Li,
Renesola’s chief executive officer, said today in a statement.  The shareholder rights plan was crafted to protect against
a takeover, the company said, and was not made in response to,
or in anticipation of, any specific bid. One ordinary share
purchase right will be distributed on Aug. 26 to current
shareholders for each ordinary share outstanding.  To contact the reporter on this story:
