Oil dropped from a three-day high in
 New York  as investors bet that increasing stockpiles and signs
of a slowing U.S. economy indicate fuel demand will falter in
the world’s biggest crude-consuming nation.  Futures slipped as much as 0.4 percent today after most
U.S. equities fell. An Energy Department report tomorrow may
show crude inventories rose 1.5 million barrels in the seven
days ended Aug. 19, climbing for a second week. London-traded
Brent declined yesterday on speculation that Libyan production
may recover after rebels entered the capital city of Tripoli in
a push to force out  Muammar Qaddafi .  Crude for October delivery fell as much as 33 cents to
$84.09 a barrel in electronic trading on the  New York Mercantile
Exchange , and was at $84.29 at 8:59 a.m. Sydney time. The
contract yesterday gained $2.01, or 2.4 percent, to $84.42, the
highest since Aug. 17. The September future expired yesterday.  Brent oil for October settlement dropped 26 cents to
$108.36 a barrel on the London-based ICE Futures Europe exchange
yesterday. The European benchmark contract settled at a premium
of $23.94 to U.S. futures, compared with a record settlement of
$26.21 on Aug. 19.  The Libyan revolt, which began in February, has reduced the
availability of light, sweet crude, or oil with low density and
sulfur content. The country’s output fell to 100,000 barrels a
day last month, a Bloomberg News survey showed. That’s less than
10 percent of the 1.59 million barrels the nation pumped in
January, before the uprising.  To contact the reporter on this story:
