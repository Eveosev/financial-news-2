Taiwan’s dollar rebounded from a
four-month low on speculation exporters were taking advantage of
recent declines to repatriate earnings.  Government bonds  fell,
pushing five-year yields up from their 2011 low.  The currency snapped a three-day slide after government
data on Aug. 19 showed export orders climbed 11.1 percent from a
year earlier in July, after a 9.2 percent gain the previous
month. Foreign funds sold $1.2 billion more local stocks than
they bought last week, bringing net sales for the year to $8.1
billion, according to exchange data.  Taiwan’s dollar strengthened 0.2 percent to NT$29.020
against its U.S. counterpart as of the 4 p.m. local close,
according to Taipei Forex Inc. It touched NT$29.135 on Aug. 19,
the weakest level since April 19.  “The NT$29 level is very attractive for exporters; we see
many of them selling the greenback,” said Tarsicio Tong, a
Taipei-based foreign-exchange trader at the Union Bank of  Taiwan .
“The export orders figures show Taiwan hasn’t been affected
much by the global slowdown.”  The yield on the 2 percent bonds due July 2016, the most-
traded securities, gained one basis point, or 0.01 percentage
point, to 0.99 percent, prices from Gretai Securities Market
show. It dropped to 0.97 percent on Aug. 19, the lowest level
for benchmark five-year debt since Dec. 20.  “There’s not much bad news coming out from the U.S. or
 Europe  over the weekend, plus yields dropped so much last week
it’s time for a minor correction,” said Artie Yang, a fixed-
income trader at First Securities Inc. in Taipei.  The overnight money-market rate, which measures interbank
funding availability, was little changed at 0.383 percent,
according to a weighted average compiled by the Taiwan Interbank
Money Center.  To contact the reporter on this story:
