The 30-stock  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  added 0.4
percent to 1,443.93 by the 6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, reversing
an earlier loss of as much as 2.2 percent. The dollar-
denominated RTS Index rallied 0.2 percent to 1,578.45.  The following were among the most active stocks in the
Russian market today. Stock symbols are in parenthesis.  OAO Polymetal (PMTL RX), a Russian silver and gold
producer, jumped to its highest since December, adding 7.3
percent to 608 rubles. Gold climbed to a record above $1,890 an
ounce in London and silver advanced to its highest price since
May 3.  OAO Razgulay (GRAZ RX), a Russian sugar producer, climbed
for the first day in three, adding 0.7 percent to 35.89 rubles.
Sugar rose in  London  to the highest in a month on concern the
crop in  Brazil , the biggest producer, will fall below forecasts,
and as  China  increased imports.  OAO Rosneft (ROSN RX),  Russia ’s largest oil company,
advanced for the first day in three as crude rebounded in  New
York . The shares climbed 0.4 percent to 199.94 rubles, erasing
an earlier decline of as much as 2.4 percent.  United Co. Rusal (RUALR RX): Russian depositary receipts
for the world’s biggest aluminum producer dropped 3.3 percent to
297.84, the most in two weeks, after OAO GMK Norilsk Nickel
lowered an offer to buy back shares, dimming prospects a deal
will be reached that may help Rusal pay back debt.  To contact the reporter on this story:
