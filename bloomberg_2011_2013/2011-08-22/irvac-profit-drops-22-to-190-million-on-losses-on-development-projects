Mirvac Group (MGR) , an Australian property
and development group, reported a 22 percent drop in full-year
profit after losses on some development projects.  Net income was A$182.3 million ($189.5 million) in the 12
months ended June 30, from A$234.7 million a year earlier, the
Sydney-based company said in a statement to the Australian stock
exchange today. Operating profit climbed 30 percent to A$358.5
million and revenue rose 19 percent to A$2.05 billion.  “Our ongoing focus is to improve the group’s return in
invested capital for the development business,” Managing
Director Nick Collishaw said in the statement. “Notwithstanding
a recent slowdown in the growth of  consumer spending , Mirvac
remains well-placed to deliver on its stated targets and our
balance sheet gearing remains conservative.”  The group recently sold a half stake in a central Sydney
office tower development project to K-REIT  Asia , taking
advantage of a recovery in office property values, and acquired
2,788 new lots to its pipeline. Still, it has seen challenges in
its residential developments, taking a A$80.8 million writeoff
on a Queensland project affected by flooding earlier this year.  Mirvac will pay a dividend of 8.2 Australian cents for the
full year, it said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
