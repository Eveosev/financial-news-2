Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ)  is making a
“big bet on software” by acquiring Autonomy Corp. and weighing
a spinoff of the personal computer business, former Chief
Executive Officer Carly Fiorina said in an interview.  Speculation that  Oracle Corp. (ORCL)  may try to buy Hewlett-
Packard “seems to be a stretch,” Fiorina said in the interview
with “Bloomberg West.” “I would not call it a takeover
target.”  The 22 percent decline in the company’s share price since
Aug. 17, the day before it announced the strategy shift and
issued profit and sales forecasts that missed analysts’
estimates, is putting pressure on management, she said.  “Any time a stock drops that much, that puts pressure on
people,” said Fiorina, who was CEO of  Palo Alto , California-
based Hewlett-Packard from 1999 through 2005.  To contact the reporter on this story:
