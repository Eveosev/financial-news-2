Japan , the worldâ€™s largest importer
of thermal coal, will burn more of the fuel over the next eight
months during maintenance period for 16 nuclear reactors,
according to Deutsche Bank.  Nuclear reactors with a total capacity of 14.4 gigawatts
will be idled for maintenance from this month to April 2012,
Deutsche Bank said in a report on Aug. 19. Coal will generate 35
percent of the power during the downtime, it said.  Coal consumption may rise by 1.6 million tons a month if
none of the 16 plants is restarted over the period, Deutsche
Bank said. That would be up 35 percent from the 4.46 million
tons used in July, according to the report.  Japan reduced coal demand this year after import terminals
were destroyed in the tsunami in March. Imports of thermal
coal will drop 5 percent this year to 113.6 million tons
compared with a year earlier, Standard Chartered Plc said on
Aug. 9. The bank estimates that imports will pick up in 2012 to
117.6 million tons.  To contact the reporter on this story:
