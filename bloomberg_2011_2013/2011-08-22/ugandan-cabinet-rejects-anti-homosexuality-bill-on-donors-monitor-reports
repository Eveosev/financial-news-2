Uganda â€™s cabinet rejected a proposed
law that seeks to criminalize homosexuality because of criticism
from donors and some sections of the public, the  Daily Monitor 
reported, without saying where it got the information.  The decision follows an Aug. 17 cabinet meeting which
concluded that there were existing laws that could fulfill the
purpose of the bill, the Kampala-based newspaper reported.  To contact the reporter on this story:
