Ghana ’s cedi headed for its highest
in five days against the dollar as mining-industry companies
sold dollars to finance operations in the West African nation.  The currency of the world’s second-biggest cocoa producer
appreciated as much as 0.9 percent to 1.5127 per dollar, before
trading less than 0.1 percent up at 1.5260 per dollar as of 1:35
p.m. in Accra, the capital, according to data compiled by
Bloomberg. A close at that level would be the strongest since
Aug. 17.  “The market received inflows from the mining sector
today,” Biggles Amponsah, a currency trader at the local unit
of Access Bank Plc, said in a telephone interview today.
“Mineral-marketing companies and others that provide support
services sold dollars to finance their activities denominated in
cedis.”  Johannesburg-based  AngloGold Ashanti Ltd. (ANG)  and Newmont
Mining Corp. of  Greenwood Village , Colorado, have mines in
Ghana, which follows South Africa in output of gold on the
continent.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
