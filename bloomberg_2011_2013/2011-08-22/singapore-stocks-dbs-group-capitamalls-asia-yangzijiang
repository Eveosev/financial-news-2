Singapore ’s Straits Times Index
dropped 0.1 percent to 2,731.81 at the close, paring losses of
as much as 1.9 percent earlier. About three stocks rose for
every two that fell in the index of 30 companies.  The following shares were among the most active in the
market. Stock symbols are in parentheses after the company name.  Banks: Kim Eng Holdings Ltd. cut its rating on Singapore
lenders to “sell,” saying lending will drop and net interest
margins will come under pressure amid slowing global economic
growth. The brokerage had “buy” ratings for both  DBS Group
Holdings Ltd. (DBS)   and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. (OCBC
SP) previously, while  United Overseas Bank Ltd. (UOB)  was a “hold.”  DBS Group, Southeast Asia’s biggest bank, slipped 1.1
percent to S$13.36. Oversea-Chinese Banking, Singapore’s second-
largest lender by market value, lost 0.9 percent to S$8.67.
Smaller rival United Overseas Bank declined 1.8 percent to
S$18.20.  CapitaMalls Asia Ltd. (CMA)  , the owner of shopping malls
in Singapore,  Japan ,  China , India and Malaysia, gained 2.2
percent to S$1.165. Daiwa Securities Group Inc. raised its
rating on the stock to “buy” from “hold,” saying investors
may have over-estimated the potential deterioration of the
company’s underlying assets in China, which is now valued at
close to zero based on its current share price.  KTL Global Ltd. (KTLG)  , a supplier of rope and other
rigging equipment to the offshore oil and gas industry, tumbled
10 percent to 35 Singapore cents after saying it expects to
report a full-year loss. The company did not elaborate, saying
the earnings will be released on or before Aug. 29.  Yangzijiang Shipbuilding Holdings Ltd. (YZJ)  , a China-
based shipbuilder, climbed 4.1 percent to S$1.01 after slumping
by the most since October 2008 on Aug. 19. The company expects
to sustain profit margins above 20 percent throughout 2012 and
2013, it said in a statement to the stock exchange.  To contact the reporter on this story:
