Overseas funds sold a net 12.8
billion rupees ($280.9 million) of Indian equities on Aug. 18
and Aug. 19, reducing their investment in stocks this year to
25.7 billion rupees, the nation’s market regulator said.  Foreigners bought 52.1 billion rupees of shares and sold
64.9 billion rupees over the two days, the  Securities and
Exchange Board of India  said  today . They bought a net 3.47
billion rupees of bonds in the period, taking total flows into
debt this year to 165 billion rupees.  Overseas investors bought a record 1.33 trillion rupees of
shares in 2010, helping fuel a 17 percent rally in the Bombay
Stock Exchange’s Sensitive Index, the best performer among the
world’s 10 biggest equity markets last year. They invested 464
billion rupees in bonds last year.  The previous record was in 2009 when flows reached 834.2
billion rupees, sparking the biggest rally in 18 years. Funds
pulled out a record 530 billion rupees from equities in 2008,
setting off the worst annual slump. Foreign funds have placed
4.497 trillion rupees in stocks and 951.7 billion rupees in
bonds since they were allowed into the country in 1993.  The regulator provides data on shares bought and sold by
large investors, including trades in the primary and secondary
markets, with a delay of at least a day.  To contact the reporter on this story:
