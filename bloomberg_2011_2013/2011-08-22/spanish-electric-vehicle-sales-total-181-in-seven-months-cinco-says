Spanish dealers sold 181 electric
cars in the first seven months of the year, evidence that state
grants havenÂ´t been enough to spark consumer demand for low-
emissions vehicles, Cinco Dias reported, citing industry data.  The 181 pure-electric vehicles, up from 16 in the year-
earlier period, compare with sales of 6,467 hybrid cars and
521,130 traditional fuel-burning cars, the newspaper said.  While the subsidy, which can be as much as 6,000 euros
($8,600) per electric car, are helping sales it is insufficient
to make a large impact in the consumer market, the report said,
citing industry officials.  Click here for web link  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
