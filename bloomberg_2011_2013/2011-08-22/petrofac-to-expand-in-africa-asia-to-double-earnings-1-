Petrofac Ltd. (PFC) , the oilfield service
provider planning to double earnings by 2015, is betting
expansion in West Africa and  Southeast Asia  will deliver growth.  Petrofac aims to secure contracts in Thailand, Indonesia,
Malaysia and Nigeria, said Chief Executive Officer Ayman Asfari.
It will invest as much as $4 billion through 2015 and bid for
more projects in Mexico after winning two fields last week, the
first foreign-investor deals in the nation since 1938.  Demand for oilfield upgrades to improve extraction rates
will be a major driver of growth, Asfari said in an interview in
 London . “The demand for the services continues to be quite
robust.”  The London-based company targets 15 percent growth in net
income this year. First-half earnings rose 6.6 percent to $246.3
million after revenue increased 25 percent to $2.7 billion, it
said today in a statement.  In Africa, Petrofac is examining projects with Nigerian
National Petroleum Corp. and possible bids for fields being sold
by  Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , outside of its partnership with Seven
Energy International Ltd. The nation will offer opportunities
because it needs to invest in refinery upgrades and end gas
flaring at oilfields, Asfari said.  “I’m quite bullish on the country,” he said. “There are
huge opportunities.”  Petrofac shares rose 3.7 percent to 1,211 pence in London.  To contact the reporters on this story:
