China’s stocks fell, extending the
benchmark index’s losses to a fifth day, on concern the
government will further tighten  monetary policy  even as the
global economic slowdown threatens to curb Chinese exports.  Industrial & Commercial Bank of China (601398)  Ltd. and China Vanke
Co., the nation’s biggest lender and property developer
respectively, led declines for financial companies after China’s
money-market rate climbed to its highest level in three weeks
and a Chinese state economist said it’s too early to loosen
monetary policies. Jiangxi Copper Co. slid to the lowest in 11
months while Anhui Conch Cement Co. fell another 5 percent today
for a 16 percent slump over four days.  “Investors have become sensitive to negative news and numb
to good news,” said Tu Jun, a strategist at Shanghai Securities
Co. “The market is still bearish amid tight liquidity and
concern over the global economic slowdown has added to the
bearish sentiment.”  The Shanghai Composite Index, which tracks the bigger of
China’s stock exchanges, lost 18.5 points, or 0.7 percent to
2,515.86 as of the 3 p.m. close, the lowest since July 19. The
gauge dropped 2.3 percent last week, capping a fifth week of
losses, the longest since December 2010. The  CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300)  slid
1.1 percent to 2,777.79 today.  The Shanghai gauge has declined 10 percent this year as the
central bank raised  interest rates  five times and ordered
lenders to set aside more cash as deposit reserves 12 times
since the start of 2010 to contain inflation that quickened to
the fastest pace in three years last month. The measure is
valued at 11.6 times estimated earnings, the lowest since
Bloomberg began to track the data in 2006, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Rate Outlook  ICBC retreated 1.2 percent to 4.08 yuan, the most since
Aug. 8.  China Construction Bank Corp. (939)  slid 0.9 percent to 4.45
yuan, even after first-half profit rose 31 percent to a record.
China Vanke slipped 0.7 percent to 8.08 yuan, while  Gemdale
Corp. (600383)  lost 3.6 percent to 6.09 yuan after first-half profit slid
61 percent to 478.3 million yuan.  China’s money-market rate climbed to its highest level in
almost three weeks after the central bank raised yields at bill
auctions, fueling speculation of further monetary tightening.  The People’s Bank of China lifted yields on its three-
month, one-year and three-year bills last week. The one-year
yield now exceeds the central bank’s benchmark rate for similar-
term deposits, a sign policy rates may be increased, Daiwa
Capital Markets Hong Kong Ltd. said in an Aug. 19 report.  Repo Jumps  The seven-day repurchase rate, a gauge of funding
availability in the financial system, rose 44 basis points, or
0.44 percentage point, to 4.96 percent as of 10:40 a.m. in
Shanghai, according to a weighted average compiled by the
National Interbank Funding Center. The rate earlier touched 4.98
percent, the highest level since Aug. 2.  China  should raise deposit rates and lenders’ reserve-
requirement ratios, the Financial News said today in a
commentary attributed to Yang Ziqiang, who wasn’t identified.
The newspaper is controlled by the central bank, which in July
2009 said there was a Yang Ziqiang running its Jinan branch.  Jiangxi Copper, China’s biggest producer of the metal,
dropped 2.1 percent to 31.20 yuan, the lowest since Sept. 30.
PetroChina Co., the nation’s largest oil producer, sank 0.4
percent to 9.77 yuan.  Copper for delivery in three months on the London Metal
Exchange declined 0.3 percent to $8,798 a ton, reversing an
earlier gain of as much as 0.7 percent. Brent oil for October
settlement dropped as much as $3.25 to $105.37 a barrel on the
London-based ICE Futures  Europe  exchange.  ‘ Double Dip ’  Concern the global economy is stalling sent U.S. stocks
tumbling last week, as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index posted
its biggest four-week loss since March 2009. Morgan Stanley
economists cut forecasts for world growth this year and said the
U.S. and Europe are “dangerously close to recession.”
 Germany ’s economy, Europe’s largest, almost stalled in the
second quarter with gross domestic product climbing 0.1 percent.  “If the world economy deteriorates and falls into a
double-dip, then China may need to loosen its policy,” said  Zhu Baoliang , deputy director at the economic forecasting department
of the State Information Center. “But the situation may not
turn out to be that serious.”  HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics are scheduled to
release preliminary data for this month’s purchasing managers’
index at 10:30 a.m. on Aug. 23. China’s PMI fell to 49.3 last
month, below the 50-level expansion threshold.  Anhui Conch Cement, China’s biggest producer of building
material, lost 5 percent to 21.75 yuan, the lowest since Feb.
24. Huaxin Cement Co. slid 3.8 percent to 23.85 yuan even after
the company’s first-half net income rose 603 percent to 542.1
million yuan from a year earlier.  Earnings Growth  Some 493 companies have reported first-half earnings in the
 Shanghai  Composite, beating analysts’ estimates by an average of
4.5 percent, compared with 4.1 percent in the same period last
year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  About 79 percent of 510 Chinese companies that have
estimated earnings for the first nine months said they may
report profits for the period, China Securities Journal said
today, citing data from Wind Information. Among them, 57
companies predicted net income may rise more than 100 percent,
the report said.  Emerging-market stocks may benefit if Federal Reserve
Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  announces measures at an Aug. 26
conference in  Jackson Hole ,  Wyoming , including U.S. bond
purchases of more than $600 billion, direct asset buying by the
central bank as well as a jobs stimulus program, Societe
Generale SA said.  Todd Martin , Asia equity strategist at the French bank,
said that investors should buy “cheap”  growth stocks  in China
and  South Korea  along with “defensive, high-yielding”
equities, according to an interview on Bloomberg Television
today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
