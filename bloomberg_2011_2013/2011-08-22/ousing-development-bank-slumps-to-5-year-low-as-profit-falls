Housing & Development Bank (HDBK)  fell to
the lowest level in more than five years after the Cairo-based
lenderâ€™s six-month profit declined by more than half.  The shares slumped 2.9 percent to 14.56 Egyptian pounds at
12:39 p.m. in Cairo, the lowest intraday level since July 2006.
That gave the company a market value of 1.67 billion pounds
($279 million). The benchmark  EGX 30 Index (EGX30)  gained 1 percent.  Net income for the period ended June 30 was 25.9 million
Egyptian pounds compared with 59.7 million pounds a year
earlier, Housing & Development said in a filing to the Egyptian
bourse today.  To contact the reporter on this story:
