Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS) , the fifth-
biggest U.S. bank by assets, fell 4.7 percent after Reuters
reported that Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein hired
defense lawyer  Reid Weingarten .  The shares fell $5.25 to $106.51 at 4:15 p.m. in New York
Stock Exchange composite trading. Reuters, citing an
unidentified government official, didn’t specify when or why
Blankfein hired Weingarten, a Steptoe & Johnson LLP partner
whose clients included former WorldCom Inc. CEO Bernard Ebbers.  Blankfein hasn’t been charged with wrongdoing amid federal
probes of Wall Street’s role in the housing boom and credit
crisis. Weingarten and David Wells, a spokesman for New York-
based Goldman Sachs, didn’t immediately respond to e-mail and
phone messages seeking comment on the report.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
