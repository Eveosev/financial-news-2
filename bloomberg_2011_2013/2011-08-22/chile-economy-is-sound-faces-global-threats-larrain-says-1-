Chile’s economy is on a sound
footing as it confronts a “complex” global economic scenario,
Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said today in an interview with
Radio Cooperativa.  The economy expanded 10 percent in the first quarter from a
year earlier and 6.8 percent in the second quarter. The
government forecasts 6.6 percent economic growth for this year.  South America ’s fifth-largest economy isn’t immune to
global turbulence and would feel the effect of a global
recession, Larrain said. Economic growth and job creation could
be hurt the most by a slowdown abroad, he said.  “We’re not immune or isolated from the rest of the
world,” Larrain said. “Chile’s economy is integrated with the
world and if there’s a very complex situation abroad,
undoubtedly there will be repercussions here.”  While Chile isn’t facing a shortage of public funds, the
government doesn’t rule out tax increases, he said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
