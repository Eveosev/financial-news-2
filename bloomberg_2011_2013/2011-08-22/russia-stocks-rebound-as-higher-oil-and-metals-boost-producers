Russian stocks erased losses and
rose for the first day in three as investor appetite for riskier
assets increased on speculation the U.S. Federal Reserve will
act to stimulate the world’s biggest economy.  The  Micex Index (INDEXCF)  increased 0.4 percent to 1,443.93 by the
6:45 p.m. close in Moscow, erasing an earlier loss of as much as
2.2 percent. OAO Rosneft,  Russia ’s largest oil producer,
advanced 0.4 percent. OAO Polymetal, the gold and silver
producer, jumped 7.1 percent, the most since February. OAO
Severstal, the nation’s biggest steel producer, added 2.1
percent. Of the 30 stocks in the gauge, 18 advanced and 12
retreated. The dollar-denominated RTS Index rallied 0.2 percent
to 1,578.45.  Record-low yields on U.S. Treasuries show traders expect
Federal Reserve Chairman  Ben S. Bernanke  to signal a third round
of asset purchases. Stocks in  Europe  rebounded from a two-year
low and U.S. equities rallied following a four week slump.  The Micex slumped last week for the fourth week, losing 2.2
percent as oil tumbled after worse-than-expected U.S. data
spurred concern the global recovery will founder.  The gauge has dropped 14 percent since the start of the
year and currently trades at 4.2 times earnings. That compares
with a 24 percent slide for  Brazil ’s Bovespa Index, which trades
at 8.1 times earnings, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.  To contact the reporter on this story:
