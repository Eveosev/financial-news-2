Three cargoes of North Sea Forties
crude for loading in September were deferred by two to five
days, according to a revised shipping schedule obtained by
Bloomberg News.  The shipments with parcel numbers F0901 and F0906 were
delayed by two days while the F0902 cargo was put back five
days, the plan showed.  Forties is one of four North Sea crude grades used to price
Dated Brent, the benchmark for more than half of global oil. The
other blends are Brent, Ekofisk and Oseberg.  Loading programs are monthly schedules of crude shipments
compiled by field operators to allow buyers and sellers to plan
their supply and trading activities.  To contact the reporter on this story:
