The  U.S. Treasury Department  faces
legal issues that must be addressed before  Libya ’s $37 billion
in frozen assets can be unblocked, a department official said.  Last month’s U.S. recognition of Libya’s Transitional
National Council as the country’s governing authority helped
pave the way toward making some of the assets available to the
rebels’ governing group, the official said today by e-mail.
Still, there remain legal issues that must be addressed before
any assets are unblocked, the official said, requesting
anonymity for lack of authorization to speak on the matter
publicly.  The official said today that talks with the Transitional
National Council are continuing, without specifying what legal
issues are involved. Since February, the U.S. has frozen $37
billion in assets of Muammar Qaddafi’s regime, according to the
Treasury Department official.  The Libyan rebels have complained about the slow pace of
providing the assets. A delegation from the transitional council
visited  Washington  in May and left without any clear indication
of when the rebels might be able to draw on some of the assets.  Libyan rebels have said the 42-year rule of Qaddafi “is
over” as opposition fighters fought pockets of loyalist troops
near the presidential compound in southern Tripoli and in the
center of the capital. President  Barack Obama  said Qaddafi must
recognize he “no longer controls” Libya as celebrations broke
out in Tripoli’s Green Square, the location for pro-government
rallies in recent months.  To contact the reporters on this story:
