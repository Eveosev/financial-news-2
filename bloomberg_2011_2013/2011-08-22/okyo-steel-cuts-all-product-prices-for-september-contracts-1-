Tokyo  Steel Manufacturing Co.,
 Japan ’s largest electric-furnace mill, cut prices for all its
products, the first reduction in three months, to compete
against Asian imports as the yen rose to a record.  H-beams, used in construction, will sell for 74,000 yen
($963) a metric ton under September contracts, the Tokyo-based
company said today in a statement. That’s 2.6 percent lower than
the previous month.  Hot-rolled coil  prices will be cut by 3
percent to 65,000 yen.  The yen rallied to the strongest postwar level of 75.95 a
dollar on Aug. 19. The increased value of the Japanese currency
makes products of Tokyo Steel and its domestic rivals more
expensive than imported steel from  South Korea  and  China .  “We decided to cut all of our product prices to correct
the price disparity” between domestic steel and Asian imports,
Managing Director Naoto Ohori said today at a briefing in Tokyo.  Prices across Tokyo Steel’s range of products will fall by
between 2,000 yen and 4,000 yen a ton for September, the company
said. Steel plates will be cut to 72,000 yen from 74,000 yen,
while pickling coil will sell for 66,000 yen a ton, compared
with 70,000 yen a month earlier.  To contact the reporter on this story:
