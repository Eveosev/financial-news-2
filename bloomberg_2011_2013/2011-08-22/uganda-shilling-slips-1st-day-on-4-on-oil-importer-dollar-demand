Uganda ’s shilling, the world’s worst-
performing currency this year, weakened for the first time in
four days as oil importers increased demand for the U.S.
currency.  The currency of  Africa ’s second-biggest coffee producer
depreciated 0.5 percent to 2,785 per dollar at 4.13 p.m. in the
capital, Kampala, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The
shilling reached 2,817.5 on Aug. 12, the weakest intraday level
since 1993.  “We have seen demand for the dollar coming in from the
energy sector and yet the dollar inflows are still subdued,”
Ahmed Kalule, the head of  currency trading  at Bank of Africa
Uganda Ltd., said by phone from Kampala. “There is marginal
movement in the market because of a shortage of shillings to buy
the dollar.”  The currency of  East Africa ’s third-biggest economy slumped
11 percent in the last two months and 17 percent this year
against the dollar, making it the world’s worst-performing
currency during both periods. A surge in food and fuel prices
pushed inflation to a more than 18-year high of 18.7 percent in
July from 15.7 percent in June.  Uganda is on the cusp of an oil boom with Tullow Oil Plc, a
U.K.-based energy company, expected to start pumping crude and
gas from the Lake Albert Basin in 2012. The country has an
estimated 2.5 billion barrels of oil, with about 1 billion
barrels in proven reserves, according to Tullow.  To contact the reporter on this story:
