Aluminum demand in July “appears to
have grown at a double-digit annual pace for the third month
running,” according to  David Thurtell , an analyst at Citigroup
Inc. in  Singapore . He made his comments by e-mail after the
International Aluminium Institute today said production averaged
70,200 metric tons a day in July. The output doesn’t include
 China , the world’s largest producer of the metal.  “Ex-China daily output was virtually at a record in July.
Taken with Chinese output and global exchange stocks, and making
a guess of IAI stocks, we estimate that ‘apparent demand’ fell
from record levels in June but was still the second highest
level ever. The market was close to balanced after a deficit in
June. Demand appears to have grown at a double-digit annual pace
for the third month running.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
