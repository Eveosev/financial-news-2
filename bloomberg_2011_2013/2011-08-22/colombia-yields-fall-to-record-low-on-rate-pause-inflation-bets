Colombia ’s peso bonds rose, pushing
yields to a record low, after the central bank unexpectedly left
its benchmark  interest rate  unchanged and on speculation lower
commodity prices will ease inflationary pressures.  The yield on Colombia’s 10 percent bonds due in July 2024
fell two basis points, or 0.02 percentage point, to 7.35 percent
at 10:24 a.m. New York time. That’s its lowest level on a
closing basis since the bonds were issued in 2009. The price
rose 0.214 centavo to 121.645 centavos per peso.  Colombia’s central bank on Aug. 19 left the overnight
lending rate unchanged at 4.50 percent,  citing  concern that
turmoil in international markets will slow global growth,
including Colombia’s economic expansion. The move surprised 22
of 36 economists surveyed by Bloomberg, while 14 had expected
the bank to pause.  “Conditions are there for long-term bonds to continue
gaining,” said Francisco Chaves, an analyst at Bogota-based
brokerage Corredores Asociados SA. “The central bank’s decision
to pause surprised a lot of people in the market. Inflation
isn’t a concern as slowing global growth leads to lower
commodity prices.”  The gap between yields on fixed-rate bonds due September
2014 and the benchmark securities due July 2024 narrowed to 125
basis points today from 152 basis points in February.  The yield on the benchmark bond due 2024 may fall to as low
as 7.05 percent by the end of September, while that of
securities due July 2020 may decline to as low as 6.9 percent,
Chaves predicts.  Annual inflation will end this year close to 3 percent,
central bank chief Jose Dario Uribe told reporters after
announcing the rate decision. Consumer prices rose 3.42 percent
in the 12 months through July, within the central bank’s 2
percent to 4 percent 2011 target.  The peso advanced 0.2 percent to 1,778.60 per dollar from
1,782.90 on Aug. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
