England beat India by an innings and
8 runs in the final cricket Test match to complete a 4-0 sweep
in the series.  Sachin Tendulkar  fell 9 runs short of a record
100th international century.  India, following on, finished on 283 after making 300 in
its first innings at the Oval in  London . England had declared on
591-6.  Tendulkar led Indiaâ€™s resistance and looked set to reach
the landmark total, only to be trapped leg-before-wicket by  Tim
Bresnan  for 91. That came shortly after Amit Mishra was
dismissed for 84 by Graeme Swann, and the India tail then
quickly collapsed.  Tendulkar and Mishra, whose stand totaled 144 runs, had
batted from the start of play today when India started on 129-3.  England has replaced India as the No. 1 team in the
International Cricket Council Test rankings.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
