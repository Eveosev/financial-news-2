AU Optronics Corp. (2409) ,  Taiwan ’s second-
largest maker of liquid-crystal displays, signed a distribution
agreement with SunWize Technologies Inc. to enter the North
American solar market.  SunWize, of Kingston, New York, will market AU Optronics’s
solar panels through its network of residential and commercial
installers, the Hsinchu, Taiwan-based company said today in a
statement.  The agreement will help AU Optronics expand sales of its
solar products as falling panel prices drive up demand for
residential systems in the U.S., said Brandon Deno, sales
director at the company’s AUO Solar unit.  “In certain markets, the early adopters have all
adopted,”  Deno said in an interview. “The residential market
is going to grow as we sell to a different customer base.”  Prices for solar panels have dropped 33 percent since
January, to $1.37 a watt, according to Bloomberg New Energy
Finance.  To contact the reporter on this story:
