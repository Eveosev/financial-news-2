Philadelphia Phillies shortstop
Jimmy Rollins said he will be out until September with a
strained groin muscle.  Rollins, the 2007 National League Most Valuable Player,
left yesterday’s game in  Washington  after the third inning.
After an MRI exam today, Rollins said on his  Twitter  page that
he had a “mild Grade 2 strain” and would be “gone till
September.”  The Phillies said on their  website  that they had placed
Rollins on the 15-day disabled list and reinstated third baseman
Placido Polanco to fill his spot on the roster.  Rollins missed 74 games last Major League Baseball season
with a strained calf muscle. He had missed just four games this
season with the Phillies, who lead the NL East with an 81-44
record heading into a three-game series with the  New York Mets ,
beginning tonight in Philadelphia.  Rollins, 32, leads all Phillies with 28 stolen bases this
season, while batting .268 with 14 home runs and 58 runs batted
in.  To contact the reporter on this story:
