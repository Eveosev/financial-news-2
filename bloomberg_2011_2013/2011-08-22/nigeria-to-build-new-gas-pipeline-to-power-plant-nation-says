Nigeria plans to build a new
pipeline to supply gas to the Olorunshogo power plant in the
western state of Ogun, The Nation newspaper reported, citing
Minister of Power Barth Nnaji.  The plant currently generates less than 100 megawatts of
its 335-megawatt capacity because of gas shortages, the Lagos-
based newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
