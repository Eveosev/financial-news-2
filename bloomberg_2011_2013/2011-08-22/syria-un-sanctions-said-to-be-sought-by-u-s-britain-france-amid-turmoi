The U.S., Britain and  France  are
preparing to ask the United Nations Security Council this week
to freeze the foreign financial assets of  Syria ’s President
Bashar al-Assad, a Western diplomat said.  The measure would also bar foreign travel by the Syrian
leader and call for an arms embargo on Syria, the diplomat said.  The three nations are planning to introduce the draft
resolution that targets Assad and about five other government
and military leaders, according to the diplomat, who spoke on
condition of not being identified because the text hasn’t been
made public.  To contact the reporter on this story:
