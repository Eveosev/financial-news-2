India  will seek private funds for
seven new ports costing 350 billion rupees ($7.6 billion) as the
government tackles transport bottlenecks that are hindering
plans to  triple  exports of agricultural and manufactured goods.  About two-thirds of the funds for the new ports will be
raised from private sector, Rakesh Srivastava, joint secretary
at the Ministry of Shipping, said yesterday in a telephone
interview in New Delhi. The government has sent the proposal for
the harbors to seven Indian states, Srivastava said without
specifying a timeframe for starting the projects.  The new ports are part of Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh ’s
plan to spend as much as $1 trillion to upgrade the country’s
infrastructure by 2017. APM Terminals, the container-terminal
arm of A.P. Moeller-Maersk A/S, and Dubai-based  DP World Ltd. (DPW) 
are among the companies that have invested in India’s harbors
amid the government’s push for private participation.  “More ports will definitely help remove trade
bottlenecks,” said  Rahul R. Pathak , principal consultant at
Mumbai-based Mantrana Maritime Advisory Pvt., which provides
consulting to shipping lines and port operators. “But the
government has to ensure that they all don’t end up competing
for the same basket of goods.”  Shares of  Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd. (GPPV) , part-owned by APM
Terminals, rose 3 percent, the most since Aug. 1, to 68 rupees
at the 3:30 p.m. close in Mumbai. Mundra Port and SEZ Ltd.,
controlled by billionaire Gautam Adani, increased 1.8 percent to
138.45 rupees. The Bombay Stock Exchange benchmark Sensitive
Index gained 1 percent.  4.4 Days  The average turnaround time for ships at Indian ports was
about 4.4 days in the year ended in March 2010, compared with
about six hours in  Singapore  and  Hong Kong , according to the
trade ministry.  India currently has 13 so-called major ports that are
administered by the federal government. They together handled
561 million tons of cargo in the year ended in March 2010,
according to official data.  The government  plans  to boost the major ports’ annual
capacity to 1.46 billion tons by March 2020 from 616.7 million
tons as of March 2010, according to the shipping ministry. About
90 percent of India’s international trade by volume is carried
through the sea.  Asia ’s third-largest economy aims to triple its exports of
gems and jewelry, textiles, auto parts and other goods to $750
billion by March 2017 from $225 billion last year, according to
the trade ministry.  Srivastava said the seven states need to set aside about
2,500 acres (1,011 hectares) of land for each new port.  To contact the reporter on this story:
