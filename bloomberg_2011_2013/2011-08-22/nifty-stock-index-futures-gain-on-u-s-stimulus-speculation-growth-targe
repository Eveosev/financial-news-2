India’s benchmark stock index was
the second-best performer in Asia after its recent decline to a
15-month low attracted investors.  Reliance Industries Ltd. (RIL) , the owner of the world’s largest
refinery complex, surged the most this year. Oil &  Natural Gas 
Corp., the largest state-run oil explorer, jumped 3.8 percent.
 Tata Motors Ltd. (TTMT) , the biggest truckmaker and owner of Jaguar
Land Rover, advanced for the first time in four days.  The Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index, or Sensex,
surged 200.03 points, or 1.2 percent, to 16,341.70 at the 3:30
p.m. close in Mumbai. The gauge slumped 4.1 percent last week,
its fourth week of losses and the longest losing run since
October 2008, when the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.
froze credit markets. The S&P CNX Nifty Index rose 1.1 percent
to 4,898.80 and its August futures settled at 4,910.45. The BSE
200 Index increased 1.2 percent to 2,027.77.  “The Nifty is looking oversold on the charts,” said
Shardul Kulkarni, a technical analyst with  Angel Broking , who
correctly predicted in June a 14 percent decline in the index.  On Aug. 19, the Sensex closed at its lowest level since
last May. Its 14-day relative strength index, which measures how
rapidly prices increased or fell in the specified period, was
22.8 on the day, the lowest since Oct. 2008. Some investors see
readings of below 30 as a signal to buy.  Indian stocks were the best performers in Asia today after
 Vietnam , data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Still, the Sensex has retreated 22 percent from its Nov. 5
peak, topping the 20 percent level that marks a so-called  bear
market  for some investors. Companies on the gauge trade at 13.6
times estimated earnings, the lowest since April 2009, and down
from 21.5 times March 2010. The MSCI Emerging Markets Index is
valued at a multiple of 9.6 times.  ‘Quality Purchases’  The Nifty index may rebound 7 percent after falling to its
lowest level in 15 months, according to technical analysis by
Angel’s Kulkarni and Edelweiss Financial Services Ltd.  “Valuations have come off in many leading counters; so it
is worthwhile to make some quality purchases,” Amar Ambani,
head of research at IIFL - India Private Clients, said in a note
today.  Reliance surged 3.3 percent to 757 rupees, the most since
Dec. 10, and its August futures settled at 759.40 rupees. Oil &
Natural Gas jumped 3.8 percent to 286.45 rupees, the highest
level in five weeks.  Tata Motors climbed 3.5 percent to 737 rupees.  Hindalco
Industries Ltd. (HNDL) , an aluminum maker that controls U.S.-based
Novelis Inc., increased 3.5 percent to 144.4 rupees.  Jaiprakash
Associates Ltd. (JPA) , a builder of dams, roads and bridges, rallied
5.5 percent to 62.7 rupees, paring this year’s decline to 41
percent. The three companies are still among the worst
performers this year on the 30-member Sensex.  Accelerate Growth  India aims to accelerate the pace of economic growth to 9
percent in the five years starting April 2012 to help cut
poverty, Prime Minister  Manmohan Singh  said on Aug. 20.  The Indian government asked the country’s Planning
Commission to consider a gross domestic product growth target of
as high as 9.5 percent, Singh said in  New Delhi  in an address to
cabinet colleagues and members of the Soviet-style government
organization that sets five-year investment targets.  “The commission has pointed out that given the
uncertainties in the global economy, and the challenges in the
domestic economy, even a 9 percent target is feasible only if we
can take some difficult decisions,” Singh said.  More Attractive  India’s economy  has become more attractive and is well-
positioned to receive capital inflows, as developed nations face
weaker economic prospects, Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee
said in an e-mailed statement on Aug. 19.  “The present crisis can, however, be expected to encourage
increase in the equity exposure by foreign pension funds and
other long-term institutional investors,” Mukherjee said in the
statement. “India is well positioned to capture this flow.”  India’s industrial production grew at the quickest pace in
three months in June, weathering the fastest rate increases
among  Asia ’s major economies. Output at factories, utilities and
mines rose 8.8 percent from a year earlier, following a revised
5.9 percent gain in May. The median of 23 estimates in a
Bloomberg News survey was for a 5.5 percent advance.  The  Reserve Bank  of India says a pace of growth that’s
quicker than 8 percent can fan inflation, underscoring the
dilemma policy makers face in raising  living standards  in Asia’s
third-biggest economy, where the  World Bank  estimates 76 percent
of the 1.2 billion people live on less than $2 a day.  Benchmark wholesale-price inflation in July climbed 9.22
percent from a year earlier after a 9.44 percent jump in June.
The median of 22 estimates in a Bloomberg News survey was for a
9.2 percent increase.  Policy Meeting  The central bank has raised its repurchase rate 11 times
since the start of 2010 to damp living costs that are rising the
fastest among the so-called BRICS nations. The next policy
meeting is on Sept. 16.  “We are hoping that on Sept. 16 the Reserve Bank will not
raise rates,”  Samir Arora , founder of hedge fund, Helios
Capital Management Pte., said in a Bloomberg UTV interview from
 Singapore . “So, two to three days before that, if it looks that
the rest of the world is calm, we may buy some stocks.”  Earnings for 46 percent of Sensex companies missed analyst
estimates in the three months ended June 30, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. That compares with 33 percent that lagged behind
forecasts in the previous quarter.  The Sensex has lost 20 percent this year on concern higher
borrowing costs will slow economic growth and erode earnings.  Overseas funds sold a net 4.08 billion rupees ($89.9
million) of Indian equities on Aug. 17, paring their investment
in stocks this year to 38.5 billion rupees, according to data on
the  website  of the Securities and Exchange Board of  India .  To contact the reporter on this story:
