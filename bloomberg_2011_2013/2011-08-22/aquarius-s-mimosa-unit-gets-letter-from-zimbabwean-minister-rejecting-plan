Aquarius Platinum Ltd. (AQP)  said its
Zimbabwean subsidiary, Mimosa Holdings, received a letter on
Aug. 19 from the Minister of Youth Development, Indigenisation
and Empowerment that, inter alia, rejects the proposed plan for
indigenisation submitted by Mimosa and requires that Mimosa
submit a revised proposal by the end of August. “Mimosa’s
senior management remains in discussions with all of the various
relevant Zimbabwean authorities,” Aquarius said in a regulatory
filing.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
