Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSA) , Europe’s
largest oil company, plans to remove crude remaining in a North
Sea pipeline that leaked this month, the U.K. government said.  “Shell now plans to continue to secure the pipeline to
protect it from the threat of storm or tidal damage,” Hugh
Shaw, a government representative overseeing the operation, said
today in an e-mailed statement. The work may take about 36
hours.  Shell divers closed the Gannet Alpha platform flow line off
 Scotland  on Aug. 19. The company identified the leak after
spotting a sheen on the water on Aug. 10. The pipeline still
holds as much as 660 metric tons (4,000 barrels) of crude,
according to Glen Cayley, an Aberdeen, Scotland-based technical
director at Shell’s exploration and production unit in  Europe .  About 218 tons of oil has leaked from the flow line,
according to Shell. That would make it the largest U.K. spill
 since 2000 , when about 524 tons were recorded, government data
available up to 2009 show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
