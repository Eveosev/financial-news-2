Germany  midfielder Sami Khedira
suffered a knee injury in last night’s soccer exhibition match
against Italy which may keep him out of the 2014  World Cup .  Khedira, 26, tore the cruciate ligament in his right knee
during the 1-1 draw in Milan, the German soccer federation said
on its website. The Real Madrid player will undergo surgery and
the federation said it hopes he’ll recover in time for the World
Cup, which will be played June 12 to July 13 in Brazil.  “That’s a bitter setback for Sami and for all of us,”
German coach  Joachim Loew  said. “Sami is a fighter, on and off
the pitch. He’s always positive, which will help him in his
recovery. I believe that he will be ready for the opening game
in Brazil.”  Germany continues its World Cup preparation with another
exhibition against England at Wembley Stadium in three days.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
