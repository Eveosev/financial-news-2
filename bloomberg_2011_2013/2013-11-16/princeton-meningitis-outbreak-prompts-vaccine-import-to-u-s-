A meningitis outbreak at  Princeton
University  of a strain not covered by vaccines available in the
U.S. has prompted federal health officials to approve import of
the drug in an effort to stop the illness.  Trustees at the Princeton, New Jersey-based Ivy League
school where at least seven students since March have developed
infections with the meningococcus B strain of the bacteria, will
consider this weekend whether to use the vaccine, made by
 Novartis AG (NOVN) , said Martin Mbugua, a spokesman for the school.  The outbreak is the first of the meningitis B strain in a
specific group, in which health officials have had the option to
vaccinate, according to Barbara Reynolds, a spokeswoman for the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The
CDC had requested and received permission last week from the
 Food and Drug Administration  to import the vaccine, a necessary
protocol since the treatment hasn’t been approved in the U.S.  The vaccine “could be used in a campuswide vaccination
campaign if it were decided that that was the best course of
action,” Reynolds said in a telephone interview. Vaccination
would be voluntary, she said. Princeton and the New Jersey
Department of Health have been working for a number of months on
the university outbreak, Reynolds said in a telephone interview.  Princeton’s trustees are still deciding how to proceed and
whether to inoculate, Mbugua said. “We will be discussing it
with our trustees this weekend, and when we have something to
announce we will make an announcement,” he said in an e-mail.  B Strain  Meningitis can be caused by viruses, fungi and bacteria,
with bacterial meningitis causing about 170,000 deaths globally
each year, according to the World Health Organization. The
infection is marked by an inflammation in the thin lining
surrounding the brain and spinal cord, causing symptoms
including stiff neck, high fever, sensitivity to light,
confusion, headaches and vomiting. As many as 10 percent of
those infected die within 48 hours after symptoms start,
according to the WHO. Brain damage, hearing loss or learning
disabilities may affect as many as 20 percent of survivors, the
Geneva-based agency said on its website.  Novartis’s Bexsero is the first vaccine against the
meningococcus B strain of the bacteria, which accounts for 40
percent of cases in the U.S. and as much as 80 percent in
 Australia  and parts of Europe. The vaccine was cleared for sale
in Europe last January and in Australia last August.  “We are coordinating with Princeton University, the CDC
and the New Jersey Department of Health to address this public
health threat,” said Novartis spokeswoman Julie Masow in an e-mail yesterday.  Vaccine Makers  Novartis, Sanofi and  GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK)  all make shots
available in Europe and the U.S. that protect against four of
the five major strains of the disease, not including the B
strain that is circulating at Princeton. The other strains are
A, C, Y and W-135.  Pfizer Inc. (PFE) , the New York-based drugmaker,
has a vaccine for meningitis B that has begun the final stage of
development. The company has said it will share data from a
phase II trial of the vaccine next year.  Seven students have been infected, with the first diagnosed
after a return from spring break in March, according to a
 statement  from the New Jersey Department of Health. By early
May, three students were diagnosed with the bacteria that
spreads through kissing, sharing drinking glasses and other
forms of close contact. The most recent patient developed
symptoms on Nov. 8, almost eight months later.  Princeton, the New Jersey health department and local
health officials are trying to find close contacts for patients
who were infected and may be vulnerable themselves to the
infection. Those people are getting antibiotics in an effort to
prevent an infection,  according  to the state health department.  Finding Links  Investigators haven’t been able to find a link between the
infections, though five of the seven are identical. One is
similar to the others, though researchers can’t yet tell if it’s
an exact match, while the latest infection is still being
tested.  Bacterial meningitis can occur sporadically, particularly
in close quarters seen on college campuses. It’s spread through
respiratory and throat secretions and close contact, though it’s
typically less infectious than viruses, including those that
cause influenza.  Princeton is a member of the Ivy League, a group of eight
selective colleges in the Northeastern U.S. About 5,200
undergraduate and 2,600 graduate students attend the school in
Princeton, New Jersey, according to its website. Chartered in
1746, alumni of Princeton include First Lady Michelle Obama and
Supreme Court Justices Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor and Samuel Alito.  To contact the reporters on this story:
