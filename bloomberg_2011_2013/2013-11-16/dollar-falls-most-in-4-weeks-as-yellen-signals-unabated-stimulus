The dollar weakened the most in four
weeks as Federal Reserve Chairman-nominee  Janet Yellen  told
Congress that monetary stimulus was still needed to spur
economic growth.  Japan ’s currency tumbled for a third week as it broke the
100-per-dollar barrier for the first time since Sept. 11. The
pound rallied to a four-year high versus the yen after the  Bank
of England  signaled an interest-rate increase sooner than
forecast. The greenback fell against the euro, wiping out last
week’s gain that followed better-than-forecast U.S. employment
data and an unexpected European Central Bank interest-rate cut.
The Fed will release minutes of its last policy meeting Nov. 20.  “You’re still early in this dollar-rollover period,”
 Jonathan Lewis , chief investment officer at Samson Capital
Advisors LLC and manager of the Samson Strong Nations Currency
Fund, said in a telephone interview from New York. “It’s fair
to say that if the market took Yellen’s perspective seriously,
easier and aggressive for as long as it takes to get the job
done, that the dollar would be rolling over more materially.”  The Bloomberg  U.S. Dollar  Index, which monitors the
greenback against 10 major counterparts, fell 0.5 percent to
1,016.88 this week in New York. It  touched  1,015.83, the lowest
since Nov. 7, and 1,025.01, the highest since Sept. 13.  The yen fell 1.2 percent to 100.19 per dollar after
depreciating to 100.44, the weakest level since Sept. 11.
Japan’s currency slid 0.5 percent to 135.21 per euro. The dollar
fell 1 percent to $1.3496 per euro.  Winners, Losers  The  Mexican peso  rose 1.8 percent and  South Africa ’s rand
climbed 1.7 percent this week, pacing gainers among the 16 most-traded currencies versus the dollar. The yen dropped 1.1 percent
for the biggest decline, followed by the Swedish krona’s 0.9
percent slide.  The Czech koruna fell for a third week versus the euro as
minutes from the central bank’s last monetary meeting showed
policy makers clashed over the need for currency interventions,
with the threat of deflation forcing the central bank to begin
its first koruna sales in 11 years on Nov. 7. The currency fell
4.6 percent that day, the biggest-ever intraday drop.  The koruna slipped 0.7 percent this week to 27.168 per euro
after dropping 4.3 percent last week.  Mexico ’s  peso  had its biggest weekly advance since July
amid eased concern that the Fed will reduce the stimulus that
has bolstered demand for the country’s securities.  The  currency  appreciated rose to 12.9346 per dollar and
touched 12.9287, the strongest this month.  U.K. Recovery  The pound strengthened as the central bank said in its
quarterly inflation report that the jobless rate is more likely
than not to fall to the 7 percent threshold that will lead it to
consider raising borrowing costs in the third quarter of 2015.
It previously predicted that would happen in the second quarter
of 2016.  Governor  Mark Carney  said Britain has “one of the
strongest recoveries in the advanced world,” while BOE policy
maker  Martin Weale  said the U.K. economy may pick up faster than
officials predict.  “We have seen such a strong move in the pound this week,”
said  Ulrich Leuchtmann , head of currency strategy at Commerzbank
AG in  Frankfurt . “The strength is justified by the improvement
in the economic performance and I think over the medium term, it
can continue.”  The pound climbed 1.8 percent this week to 161.49 yen and
touched 161.65, the highest since August 2009. Sterling added
0.6 percent to $1.6118 after reaching $1.6135, the highest level
since Oct. 29.  Yellen ‘Reputation’  Yellen at her Nov.14 congressional hearing indicated she’ll
press on with the central bank’s unprecedented monetary stimulus
until she sees a robust recovery, downplaying risks the policy
is inflating asset bubbles.  Economists forecast the Fed will delay tapering asset
purchases until March even after a report showed employers added
more jobs than forecast in October.  “She pretty much lived up to her reputation,” said Eimear Daly, a currency-market analyst at Monex Europe Ltd. Daly said
she expects U.S. the Fed will reduce asset purchases in
December.  Policy makers will pare the monthly pace of bond buying to
$70 billion at their March 18-19 meeting from the current pace
of $85 billion, according to the median of 32 economist
estimates in a Bloomberg News survey on Nov. 8. The median
forecast in an Oct. 17-18 survey of 40 economists also called
for a reduction to $70 billion in March.  ECB Easing  Peter Praet, an ECB executive board member, said Nov. 14
that the central bank’s policy debate was on timing for an
interest-rate reduction and that there was “strong agreement on
the assessment” of its policy. He said more measures are
available, if needed. ECB President  Mario Draghi  cut the euro
zone’s main refinancing rate to a record-low 0.25 percent on
Nov. 7.  “The ECB is at the start of a new phase of easing, which
will last many months,” Kit Juckes, global strategist at
Societe Generale SA, wrote Nov. 14 in an e-mail. “That will
contrast with the Fed tip-toeing in the other direction.”  The common currency may weaken toward $1.30 in coming
weeks, Juckes said.  Futures traders increased their bets that the yen will
decline against the U.S. dollar to the most since May, figures
from the Washington-based Commodity Futures Trading Commission
show.  The difference in the number of wagers by  hedge funds  and
other large speculators on a decline in the yen compared with
those on a gain -- so-called net shorts -- was 95,107 on Nov.
12, compared with net shorts of 73,792 a week earlier.  The euro gained 6.3 percent this year, the best performer
among 10 developed-nation currencies tracked by Bloomberg
Correlation-Weighted Indexes. The yen weakened 12 percent to
lead decliners, while the dollar advanced 3.6 percent.  To contact the reporter on this story:
