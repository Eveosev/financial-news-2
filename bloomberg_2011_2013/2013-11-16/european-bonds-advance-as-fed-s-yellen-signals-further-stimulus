European  government bonds  rose led
by benchmark German bunds after Federal Reserve Chairman nominee
 Janet Yellen  signaled she will maintain stimulus, boosting
demand for fixed-income assets.  Spanish and Italian 10-year securities also rose as a
report yesterday confirmed that inflation in the 17 countries
that share the euro slowed to the least in four years. Benchmark
German  10-year yields  approached the  lowest  since August as
European Central Bank Executive Board member Peter Praet said
negative  interest rates  are a potential option if needed to
ensure  price stability . Ireland’s two-year yield dropped below 1
percent for the first time since June.  “We got a reminder that Yellen is still a dove and we saw
a bit of relief on the back of that,” Allan von Mehren, chief
analyst at Danske Bank A/S in Copenhagen, said yesterday.
“Clearly the ECB has turned dovish and the low inflation number
means we could see more easing in early 2014. That’s clearly
supporting the European fixed-income markets and that’s
something we expect to continue.”  Germany ’s  10-year yield  fell five basis points, or 0.05
percentage point, this week to 1.71 percent at 5 p.m. London
time yesterday. The rate dropped to 1.65 percent on Oct. 31, the
lowest since Aug. 8. The 2 percent bund due in August 2023
gained 0.46, or 4.60 euros per 1,000-euro ($1,348) face amount,
to 102.615.  ‘Strong Recovery’  Yellen voiced her commitment to using bond purchases known
as quantitative easing to boost growth and lower unemployment
that remains above 7 percent.  “I consider it imperative that we do what we can to
promote a very strong recovery,” she said in response to a
question during testimony on Nov. 14 to the Senate Banking
Committee in  Washington . The Fed currently buys $85 billion of
Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities each month to put
downward pressure on borrowing costs.  The annual  inflation rate  in the euro area declined to 0.7
percent in October, the lowest since November 2009, the European
Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said, in line with an
initial estimate on Oct. 31. The euro-region economy  expanded 
0.1 percent in the third quarter, down from 0.3 percent in the
previous three months, the statistics office said on Nov. 14.  The ECB cut its main refinancing  rate  to 0.25 percent on
Nov. 7, as predicted by only three of 70 economists in a
Bloomberg News survey.  ECB Measures  “The signal is that we still have a number of measures
that we can take if the situation requires,” ECB’s Praet said
in an interview on Nov. 14.  Italian  10-year yields  declined five basis points in the
week to 4.09 percent, while rates on similar-maturity  Spanish (GSPG10YR) 
bonds slipped four basis points to 4.07 percent. Ireland’s two-year yield dropped for a ninth week,  falling  nine basis points
to 1.01 percent after reaching 0.997 percent, the least since
June 11.  A composite gauge of euro-area manufacturing and services
activity, based on a survey of purchasing managers, will show
output expanded for a fifth month in November, according to a
Bloomberg survey of economists before the data is released on
Nov. 21.  German government bonds handed investors a loss of 1.1
percent this year through Nov. 14, according to Bloomberg World
Bond Indexes.  Spain ’s returned 11 percent and  Italy ’s earned 7
percent, the indexes show.  To contact the reporter on this story:
