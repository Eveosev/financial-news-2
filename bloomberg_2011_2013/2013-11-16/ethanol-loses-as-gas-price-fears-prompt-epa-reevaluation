For months, lobbyists for refiners
such as  Valero Corp. (VLO)  and  Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM)  have warned that a
U.S. law requiring increased use of ethanol would result in  
a mandate to add more of the fuel than they could safely blend
into gasoline.  While that claim was mocked by executives at renewable fuel
producers such as Poet LLC and a joint venture of  BP Plc (BP/)  and
 DuPont Co. (DD) , yesterday the refiners got their way.  The so-called “blend wall” was  cited  by the Environmental
Protection Agency as the key reason to propose the first cut in
requirements for renewable fuels since they were mandated by a
2007 law.  “EPA is proposing to place the nation’s renewable energy
policy in the hands of the oil companies,” Bob Dinneen, the
president of the Renewable Fuels Association, which represents
ethanol makers such as  Abengoa SA. (ABG)   Refiners, fast-food restaurants, motorboat makers and
chicken farmers have all pushed the EPA to scale back the
ethanol mandate, saying it risks ruining engines by forcing more
ethanol to be blended into gasoline and is acting to push up
demand for corn. Gasoline demand is falling, and rising
requirements for renewable fuels are ramping up the percentage
of those fuels in the total mix.  The EPA proposal to require 15 billion to 15.52 billion
gallons of renewable fuels such as corn ethanol and biodiesel in
2014 was a rare victory for the oil industry under President
 Barack Obama , and one the biofuel industry said could set back
investments in their plants. That proposal compares with 18.15
billion gallons set in the legislation, making it the first time
the legal mandate would be cut after years of annual increases
designed to boost the industry.  Blend Wall  “EPA’s recognition of the blend wall and the potential
adverse effects on consumers is a welcome step,”  Charles Drevna , the president of the American Fuel & Petrochemical
Manufacturers, which  represents  refiners such as Valero and
 Tesoro Corp. (TSO) , said in a statement. The renewable fuels
legislation “requires quantities of biofuel to be consumed that
are well beyond the technical limitations of many engines in
service today.”  Valero rose 16 cents yesterday to $43 at 4 p.m. in  New York 
Stock Exchange trading, while  Archer-Daniels-Midland Co. (ADM) , which
processes corn and other agricultural products, dropped $1.44 to
$40.56, its biggest decline since Aug. 26. Prices of soybeans,
used to make biodiesel, fell the most in six weeks, and corn
futures dropped 1.4 percent to $4.305 a bushel in Chicago.  Renewable fuel supporters say the oil industry is holding
back investments in the infrastructure to deliver higher blends
of ethanol because it wants to preserve its market share.  ‘Flexible-Fuel Vehicles’  “Part of our challenge is, the oil industry has done a
pretty good job of making it harder to access higher blends and
making it harder to take advantage of all the flexible-fuel
vehicles that are on the road today,” Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said this week.  Within the range of values it provided, the EPA listed
specific volume requirements it was proposing: 15.21 billion
gallons for renewable fuel generally and 2.2 billion for
advanced biofuels, such as biodiesel. A final rule is due in the
first quarter of 2014, after refiners and ethanol makers weigh
in.  The EPA also proposed cutting the mandate for biodiesel and
cellulosic products to as much as 2.5 billion gallons, compared
to the 3.75 billion gallon target in the legislation.  By cutting back on quotas for those so-called “next
generation” fuels, producers said that EPA risked killing
investments necessary to get fuel from switchgrass, corn husks
or algae.  ‘Hurt Efforts’  “The numbers released today will hurt efforts to continue
to expand and grow this cutting edge technology, create new
American jobs and further American energy independence,” Hugh
Welsh, president in North America for Royal DSM NV, a Heerlen,
Netherlands-based company that’s building a U.S. plant to make
fuel from corn cobs and husks.  EPA officials say they are listening to those concerns and
have pledged to preserve a market for cutting-edge renewable
fuels.  In its rule yesterday, the agency stuck to that estimate,
saying it forecasts that 12.95 billion to 13.09 billion gallons
of ethanol could be consumed in the U.S. in 2014, which would be
below the 13.8 billion gallons it mandated this year.  Refiners, which have resisted the corn ethanol mandate,
haven’t fought so hard against biodiesel, as it doesn’t present
the same constraints as ethanol. Still, the cut in their use as
proposed by EPA was also panned by that industry.  “This proposal, if it becomes final, would create a
shrinking market, eliminate thousands of jobs and likely cause
biodiesel plants to close across the country,” Anne Steckel,
vice president of the National Biodiesel Board, said. “It also
sends a terrible signal to investors and entrepreneurs.”  To contact the reporters on this story:
