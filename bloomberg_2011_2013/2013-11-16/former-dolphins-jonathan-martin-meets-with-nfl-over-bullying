Former Miami Dolphins offensive
lineman Jonathan Martin met yesterday with the National Football
League investigator probing accusations of bullying by
teammates, his attorney David Cornwell said.  Martin left the team after he alleged he was harassed for
the 1½ seasons he spent with the Dolphins. Miami suspended
indefinitely offensive lineman Richie Incognito on Nov. 3 for
conduct detrimental to the team after an expletive-filled voice
message he sent to Martin became public.  Martin went into “great detail” with  New York  lawyer  Ted Wells  and his staff about the issue, said Cornwell, a partner
with Gorden & Rees LLP in Atlanta, in an e-mail.  The player declined to discuss the contents of the meeting
publicly and said he was prepared to sit down with Dolphins’
management including owner Stephen Ross and Chief Executive
Officer Tom Garfinkel.  “This is the right way to handle the matter,” Martin said
in the statement. “Beyond that, I look forward to working
through the process and resuming my career in the National
Football League.”  Incognito has filed a grievance against the Dolphins that
challenges his suspension, said the NFL Players Association two
days ago. The player sees a hearing on an expedited basis so he
can return to the Dolphins.  The  National Football League ’s collective bargaining
agreement states that the maximum suspension a team can issue
for detrimental conduct is four games, plus one additional game
check.  To contact the reporter on this story:
