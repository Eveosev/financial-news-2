China will meet population targets
even after easing its one-child policy, avoiding heightened
pressure on food and health-care resources, a government
official said.  The plan to allow parents to have two children if either is
an only child won’t trigger a surge in births in the short term
as relatively few couples fulfill the criterion, Wang Peian,
deputy director of the National Health and Family Planning
Commission, said in a  statement  on the government website today.  The Communist Party pledged yesterday to ease family
planning rules that were put in place three years after Chairman
 Mao Zedong ’s death in 1976 and have led to a declining labor
force. The population will remain “significantly” below the
2020 target of 1.43 billion used for food and public service
planning, Wang said.  “We can say confidently that implementing the birth policy
will not bring huge pressure on  food security , health-care,
education, jobs and other basic public services,” Wang said in
the statement. The policy will help keep China’s labor force at
a reasonable size, and ease the speed of population aging, he
added.  China’s population will peak “well” below 1.5 billion in
about 2033, Wang said.  The Communist Party’s leaders announced the plan to ease
the one-child policy with other reforms such as the expansion of
farmers’ land rights after a four-day conclave in Beijing this
month.  Each of  China ’s provinces will be allowed to decide when to
implement the new rule based on local conditions, Wang said,
without giving any specific dates.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
