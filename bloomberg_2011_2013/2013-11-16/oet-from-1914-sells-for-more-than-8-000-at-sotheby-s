A two-bottle lot of Moet & Chandon
Champagne from the 1914 vintage fetched 10,340 pounds ($16,620)
at a  Sotheby’s (BID)  wine sale in London this week, exceeding the
auction house’s presale estimate.  The historic lot was part of a vintage collection marking
the Champagne house’s 270th anniversary. Bottles of Moet
spanning the years from 2004 back to the start of World War I,
and including 174 magnums and three jeroboams, fetched 147,333
pounds in total, according to Sotheby’s.  The auction came as the benchmark Liv-ex Fine Wine 50 Index
has given up gains made in the first 10 weeks of the year, after
investors deterred by prices of recent Bordeaux vintages sought
alternatives outside the region. The Champagne, including the
bottles from 1914, came direct from the cellars of Moet &
Chandon, part of  LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (MC) , the
world’s largest luxury goods company.  “The harvest had to be brought forward because of the
outbreak of the world war, which meant that in its youth the
1914 was quite austere and closed,” Jo Thornton, managing
director of Moet Hennessy U.K. Ltd., said in an interview in
London on Nov. 11. Champagne “tends to age for much more than
people think. This will be drinking for years to come.”  Three two-bottle lots of Moet & Chandon 1921 sold for 8,813
pounds each, while three single bottles of the 1928 vintage
fetched 5,405 pounds each, beating estimates. Two other two-bottle lots of the 1914 vintage fetched 7,285 pounds each.  Global Demand  In the broader Champagne market, U.S. and Japanese demand
has been driving Champagne sales at LVMH while  Europe  still
lags, according to Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Guiony.  LVMH’s Champagne volumes rose 2 percent in the first nine
months of this year, with top-selling brands in the U.S.
including  Veuve Clicquot  and  Dom Perignon , Guiony said on an
analysts’ conference call Oct. 16. The Japanese market, while
smaller by volume, is important in value terms because premium
Dom Perignon accounts for most of the sales.  “The U.K. is tracking slightly behind the global average”
for Champagne sales, Thornton said in the interview. “Consumers
continue to be under quite a lot of pressure here. Disposable
income is certainly being squeezed and we’re seeing that in
terms of our sales.”  LVMH’s Champagne brands include Krug, Mercier and Ruinart
in addition to Moet & Chandon, Dom Perignon and Veuve Clicquot,
according to its website. Its still wine business includes
Bordeaux estates Chateau Cheval Blanc and Chateau d’Yquem as
well as vineyards in  California ,  South America  and  Australia .  Export Drive  The economic slowdown in Europe sparked by the debt crisis
of the past four years has reduced the Champagne industry’s
sales in  France , focusing growers’ sales efforts on overseas
markets. The domestic French market accounted for 55.5 percent
of all Champagne bottles sold last year, the lowest level since
1977, according to data on the website of the Comite
Interprofessionnel des Vins de Champagne, or  CIVC , while exports
for the industry overall were more buoyant.  This week’s Sotheby’s sale also included a case of La Tache
2009 DRC Burgundy, which fetched 25,850 pounds, while 12 bottles
of Le Pin 1990 from the Pomerol estate sold for 21,150 pounds,
according to the auction house.  At a separate auction held by Christie’s International Plc
in Geneva this week over two days ending Nov. 13, the top price
was paid for six magnums of Chateau La Mission-Haut Brion 1955,
which fetched 47,000 Swiss francs ($51,320), beating its presale
estimate. Four bottles of Romanee-Conti 2009 Domaine de la
Romanee Conti Burgundy sold for 44,650 francs, within estimates.  Following is a table of major wine auctions held so far
this year, with the total sold in dollars. Links are to auction
