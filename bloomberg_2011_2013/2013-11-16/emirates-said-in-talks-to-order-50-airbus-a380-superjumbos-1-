Emirates, the world’s largest
international airline, said it will purchase an additional 50
Airbus SAS A380 superjumbos, the biggest single deal for the
largest commercial jetliner.  The order, valued at about $20 billion at list price, was
signed today as the Dubai Air Show. The aircraft will serve both
a replacement and growth purpose, Emirates said.  The transaction is a record for the A380, which was at risk
of ending 2013 without a deal. Instead, Airbus can now make the
year the most successful for its superjumbo should leasing
company Doric firm up its plan to buy 20 units, which it
announced in June. Emirates is already the biggest customer for
the Airbus flagship with orders for 90 jets and had taken
delivery of 38 by the end of October.  The boost comes after Airbus Chief Financial Officer Harald Wilhelm said Nov. 14 that the Toulouse, France-based company may
need to examine whether to reduce A380 output, with unsold
production slots as early as 2015.  Emirates was also the buyer of the prior record purchase,
committing to taking 32 jets at the Berlin Air Show in 2010.
With the additional purchase, the Middle Eastern carrier would
have signed for more than 50 percent of all A380s sold.
Customers typically get discounts to list prices.  The planemaker was bracing for a third straight year in
which it failed to meet order targets after  Deutsche Lufthansa
AG (LHA)  canceled a commitment to take three aircraft in September.
Airbus had a backlog of 144 planes at the end of last month.  Airbus is reversing a string of A380 setbacks after  Air
France-KLM (AF)  Group,  Europe ’s largest carrier, followed Lufthansa’s
cancellations by saying it may drop two superjumbos for smaller
planes. Virgin Atlantic Airways Ltd.  has said it can’t be sure
to take any of its six A380s on order, while  Japan ’s  Skymark
Airlines Inc. (9204)  said this month it still needs financing for the
planes it wants.  Boeing Co. (BA)  has also struggled to book sales for its rival
747-8, and has twice reduced output for the plane this year.
Boeing Commercial Airplanes President Ray Conner told reporters
in Dubai he sees signs the market may start rebounding next year
to allow build rates to rise from 1.5 units a month now.  To contact the reporter on this story:
