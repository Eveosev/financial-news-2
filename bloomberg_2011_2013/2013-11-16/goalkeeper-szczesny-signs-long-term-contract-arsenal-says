Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny
signed a “new long-term contract,” the Premier League soccer
club said on its website.  Szczesny, 23, joined Arsenal in 2006 from Legia Warsaw. The
Poland international has made 121 appearances since making his
first-team debut with the Gunners in 2009.  “I have always believed he is an extremely talented
player, with excellent reflexes and good mental strength,”
Arsenal manager  Arsene Wenger  said on the team’s website. “He
continues to grow and improve all the time too, so he has the
potential to be even better. He can be an important part or
Arsenal Football Club for many years to come.”  Premier League leader Arsenal didn’t disclose the length or
financial terms of the contract.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
