Reigning world champion Mikaela
Shiffrin of the U.S. won the opening World Cup skiing slalom of
the season in Levi,  Finland .  Shiffrin, 18, posted a time of one minute, 55.07 seconds
over two runs to beat  Germany ’s Maria Hoefl Riesch by 1.06
seconds. Defending overall World Cup champion Tina Maze of
Slovenia was third.  Shiffrin was the only skier to finish both runs in under 58
seconds. It was the fifth World Cup win of the teenager’s
career.  “Maybe I was a little bit lucky in the first run, I can’t
even really remember it,” she said on the U.S. Ski Team’s
website. “I just wanted to take the second run like its own
race and really hammer it. I was in the gate and like, ’No
mercy, charge down this course’ and I think I did.”  The win moves Shiffrin to the top of the overall World Cup
standings with 140 points, 40 more than  Switzerland ’s Lara Gut,
who didn’t race today.  The women next race a series of events in Beaver Creek,
 Colorado , Nov. 29 to Dec. 1.  To contact the reporter on this story:
