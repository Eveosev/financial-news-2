Floods have killed at least 26
people in central  Vietnam , the government  said  on its website.  There were 13 fatalities reported in the coastal province
of Binh Dinh, seven in Quang Ngai province, and two each in Gia
Lai, Phu Yen and Quang Nam provinces, the government said in its
posting. Quang Ngai and Quang Nam are on the coast north of Binh
Dinh, Phu Yen is to the south and Gia Lai is an interior Central
Highlands province. One person was reported missing in the
Central Highlands province of Kon Tum, the government said.  The region from Thua Thien-Hue to Phu Yen provinces was hit
by three days of heavy rains, with some areas receiving 300
millimeters (12 inches), the government  said  in another posting.
Thousands of houses in Quang Nam province were surrounded by
waters exceeding three meters (10 feet), and roads into the area
were blocked by impassable flooding.  Guests in hotels in the central town of Hoi An were
evacuated, according to the government.  Hoi An is a United Nations World Heritage Site, as are the
monuments in and around the city of Hue in Thua Thien-Hue
province.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story
