Sachin Tendulkar was victorious in
the final Test match of his record-setting cricket career as
 India  beat the West Indies by an innings and 126 runs.  Tendulkar, 40, who scored the most runs in Test history,
was making his 200th and final appearance in the longest form of
the game.  He scored 74 yesterday in his hometown of Mumbai as India
was 495 all out in its first innings to lead by 313 runs. The
West Indies were than bowled out for 187, denying the man
nicknamed “Little Master” another chance to bat.  The Indian team, which won the series 2-0, formed a walking
guard of honor with Tendulkar as they left the field at Wankhede
Stadium. He stopped several times to wave to the cheering crowd
and wiped tears from his eyes.  “It’s hard to believe it’s coming to an end,” Tendulkar
said in a speech to the crowd after the game. “My cricket
started right here on this ground in  Mumbai . The dream was
obviously to play for India.”  Tendulkar ends his Test career with 15,921 runs, 2,543 more
than  Australia ’s Ricky Ponting in second place. He also holds
the record for more runs in one-day international matches with
18,426, along with the marks for most centuries in both forms of
the game.  In 2011, he helped India win its first Cricket World Cup
title since 1983. Last year he became the first player to score
100 international centuries.  Tendulkar made his Test debut against  Pakistan  in November
1989 and registered his first three-figure score the following
year against  England . In 2008, he passed West Indian batsman
Brian Lara as the top scorer in elite five-day matches.  To contact the reporter on this story:
