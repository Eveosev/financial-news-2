Roy Hibbert  had 24 points and 10
rebounds to help the Indiana Pacers remain undefeated after nine
games with a 104-77 win over the Milwaukee Bucks in a National
Basketball Association game.  The Pacers are the first team in the league to begin their
season 9-0 since Dallas in 2002-03.  “We have expectations and we want to win,” Hibbert told
reporters last night. “We want to play deep, deep into the
playoffs.”  Hibbert hit 8-of-10 field goal attempts and was 8-for-8
from the free-throw line.  Paul George  had 22 points and Lance Stephenson scored 11
points for the Pacers, who forged ahead 52-37 at halftime at
Bankers Life Fieldhouse in Indianapolis.  O.J. Mayo led the  Milwaukee Bucks  with 20 points and Khris
Middleton and Gary Neal each added 11 points.  The Pacers can set a record for the franchise’s longest
winning streak in their NBA history with a victory tonight
against the Chicago Bulls. They won nine in a row in 2002 from
Nov. 2-22.  To contact the reporter on this story:
