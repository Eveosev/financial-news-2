The defending champion  Czech
Republic  beat  Serbia  in straight sets in doubles to take a 2-1
lead in the Davis Cup tennis final.  Tomas Berdych and Radek Stepanek defeated Ilija Bozoljac
and Nenad Zimonjic 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (7-4) in Belgrade to leave the
Czechs needing one victory in tomorrow’s two reverse singles
matches to claim the top team title in men’s tennis for a third
time. Serbia must win both matches to capture its second Davis
Cup.  Serbia’s Novak Djokovic, the world’s second-ranked player,
will meet No. 7 Tomas Berdych in tomorrow’s first match, with
Stepanek taking on Dusan Lajovic in the second.  Djokovic beat Stepanek in yesterday’s opening match before
Berdych defeated Lajovic.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
