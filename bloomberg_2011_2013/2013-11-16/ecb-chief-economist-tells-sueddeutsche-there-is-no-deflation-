ECB still has enough room to
maneuver, beyond interest-rate moves, Peter Praet says in
interview with  Sueddeutsche Zeitung .
* Should interest rates be lowered to zero, ECB could still
deploy quantitative measures including buying government bonds,
or injecting capital into banks, Praet tells Sueddeutsche,
adding “we are not at this point.”
* Germany should invest more, as investment spending declined
sharply in past 5 years, as opposed to private consumption
*NOTE: ECB President  Mario Draghi  pushed for an interest rate
cut on Nov. 7 over opposition from Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann and at least two other Governing Council members,
according to four euro-area central bank officials.  To contact the reporter on this story:
