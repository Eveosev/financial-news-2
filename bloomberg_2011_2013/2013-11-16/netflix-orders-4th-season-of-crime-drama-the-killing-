Netflix Inc. (NFLX) , the biggest
subscription streaming service, ordered a limited fourth season
of the cable-TV detective show “The Killing” from producer Fox
Television Studios.  Netflix obtained exclusive streaming rights for the six-episode series finale, which will be available to 40 million
members worldwide, according to an e-mailed statement today from
the Los Gatos, California-based company.  This is the second revival for “The Killing,” which ran
on  AMC Networks Inc. (AMCX) ’s cable-TV channel. AMC canceled the series
after the second season. A few months later, Fox Television
reached a deal with Netflix to co-produce the series with AMC,
leading to a third season, according to IMDB.com.  The program, following two homicide detectives, is based on
the Danish series “Forbrydelsen.” Netflix didn’t say when the
fourth season will air.  Netflix rose 2.1 percent to $349.76 at the close in New
York. The shares have almost quadrupled this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
