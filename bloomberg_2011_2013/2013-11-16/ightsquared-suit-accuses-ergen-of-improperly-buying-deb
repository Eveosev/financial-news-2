Dish Network Corp. (DISH)  Chairman Charles Ergen was accused in a lawsuit by Philip A. Falcone’s
LightSquared Inc. of secretly buying debt in the bankrupt
wireless company to lay the groundwork for a takeover.  The lawsuit was filed yesterday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
 Manhattan  against Ergen, satellite-TV operator Dish, EchoStar
Corp. and other entities affiliated with Ergen. According to the
complaint, Ergen bought $1 billion in LightSquared debt through
SP Special Opportunities LLC without revealing he was doing so,
and violated a credit agreement.  “Under the credit agreement, LightSquared LP’s direct
competitors, including Dish and EchoStar, and their
subsidiaries, are ‘Disqualified Companies’” and can’t own a
stake in the debt, Reston, Virginia-based LightSquared said in
the filing.  U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Shelley Chapman last month dismissed
similar claims brought by Falcone’s Harbinger Capital Partners
LLC, saying that LightSquared was the more appropriate party to
bring a complaint against Ergen.  Ergen, 60, has said the Harbinger suit was an attempt to
derail his $2.22 billion cash offer to buy LightSquared, an
owner of wireless spectrum. Ergen and SP said in a motion to
dismiss the Harbinger case that they made no “false
representations” about the purchases, so there was no fraud.  Block Claims  In the latest suit, LightSquared asked the court to
disallow Ergen’s claims on the debt and to award punitive
damages to be proved at trial.  Rachel Strickland, a lawyer for Ergen, declined to comment
on the suit.  LightSquared filed for bankruptcy in May 2012, listing
assets of $4.48 billion and debt of $2.29 billion. The company
is trying to reorganize while seeking U.S. approval to use its
wireless spectrum. Regulators blocked the service in 2012 after
GPS-device makers and users, including the U.S. military and
commercial airlines, said LightSquared’s signals would confound
navigation gear.  A bankruptcy auction is planned, with Ergen’s offer serving
the opening bid. Competing bids are due by Nov. 20 and the
auction will tentatively be held Nov. 25, Dec. 6 at the latest.  Bob Toevs, a Dish spokesman, called LightSquared’s
complaint “a desperate measure to avoid selling its assets to
the highest bidder.”  ‘Frivolous Litigation’  “While frivolous litigation is an unfortunate byproduct of
this process, Dish remains focused on participating in the
upcoming auction for LightSquared’s assets and is confident that
these matters will be determined in its favor,” Toevs said in
an e-mail.  Ergen also faces a complaint from shareholders of
Englewood, Colorado-based Dish over his actions regarding
LightSquared. Nevada state court judge Elizabeth Gonzalez in  Las
Vegas  is scheduled to hear arguments Nov. 25 on whether he
should be allowed to participate in Dish’s bid for the wireless
spectrum owned by LightSquared.  LightSquared has contacted more than 90 potentially
interested parties in an effort to find a bid to compete with
Ergen’s, working at the direction of a special committee of its
board with Moelis & Co. to engage potential offers, the company
said Nov. 1 in court papers.  The company will have creditors vote on four competing
plans of reorganization: one from the company; one from an ad-hoc group of lenders; one from Harbinger, and one from U.S. Bank
NA and Mast Capital Management LLC.  The Chapter 11 case is In re LightSquared Inc., 12-bk-12080,  U.S. Bankruptcy Court , Southern District of  New York 
(Manhattan). The lawsuit is LightSquared LP v. SP Special
Opportunities LLC, 13-ap-01390, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern
District of New York (Manhattan).  To contact the reporter on this story:
