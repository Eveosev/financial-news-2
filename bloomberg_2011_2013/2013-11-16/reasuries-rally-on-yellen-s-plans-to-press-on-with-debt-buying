Treasuries rose, pushing 10-year
yields down for the first week since October, as Federal Reserve
Chairman-nominee Janet Yellen underscored her commitment to
strengthening the economy before cutting monetary stimulus.  The difference between five- and 10-year note yields, known
as the yield curve, widened to the most in more than two years
on Oct. 14, the day Fed Vice Chairman Yellen told Congress at a
confirmation hearing that the benefits of bond-buying still
outweigh the costs. The Fed will release minutes of its Oct.
29-30 meeting on Nov. 20 while Treasury is scheduled to sell $13
billion in 10-year inflation-indexed debt the next day.  “She came across with a dovish tone,” said  Sean Simko ,
who oversees $8 billion at SEI Investments Co. in Oaks,
 Pennsylvania . “The comments around there’s more risk of
disrupting the recovery than creating a bubble put a bid into
the marketplace.” A so-called monetary-policy dove is thought
to favor stimulus and lower interest rates.  The benchmark 10-year yield dropped four basis points this
week, or 0.04 percentage point, to 2.71 percent in New York,
according to Bloomberg Bond Trader prices. The 2.75 percent note
due November 2023 traded at 100 13/32.  The yield drop is the biggest since  the week  ending Oct.
25. It touched 2.79 percent on Nov. 12, the highest level since
Sept. 18. Five-year yields fell seven basis points on the week,
the most since Oct. 18.  Futures Moves  Hedge-fund managers and other large speculators  trimmed 
net-short positions in 10-year note futures in the week ending
Nov. 12, according to U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission
data. Bets prices will fall outnumbered long positions by
181,079 contracts on the Chicago Board of Trade, down 8,109
contracts, or 4 percent, from a week earlier.  The  yield curve  measuring the difference between five-year
and 10-year yields reached 1.37 percentage points this week, the
most since August 2011, as speculation the Fed’s target interest
rate may be lower for longer under a Yellen-led Fed, pressured
short-term yields.  “As dovish as Yellen is, she’s dovish for the front end of
the curve,” said  David Ader , U.S. government bond-strategy head
at CRT Capital Group LLC in  Stamford ,  Connecticut .  Treasuries due in 10 years and longer lost 10.2 percent
this year through Nov. 14, according to Bloomberg World Bond
 Indexes. (BUSY10)  Those maturing between one- and three years  returned 
0.4 percent, the indexes show.  Term Premium  The 10-year term premium was at 0.24 percent yesterday,
based on a valuation model used by the Fed that is calculated by
using interest-rate expectations, economic growth and inflation.
The gauge touched 0.13 percent on Oct. 29, the most expensive
level since June.  The measure has averaged negative 0.03 percent this year,
indicating the securities were overvalued. The security is
considered at fair value at a term-premium level between 0.25 to
0.75 percent.  The Fed buys $85 billion of Treasuries and mortgage-backed
securities each month to keep downward pressure on borrowing
costs. Officials will decide to pare purchases to $70 billion a
month at their March 18-19 meeting, according to the median of
economist estimates in a Bloomberg survey on Nov. 8.  Traders project an 86.5 percent chance the Fed will keep
its benchmark rate at current levels by December 2014, compared
with a 72.7 percent odds a month earlier, according to fed funds
futures data compiled by Bloomberg.  Policy Targets  Fed policy makers have pledged  interest rates  will stay at
almost zero while unemployment remains above 6.5 percent. The
jobless rate was at 7.3 percent last month, the Labor Department
said Nov. 8.  “It’s important not to remove support, especially when the
recovery is fragile and the tools available to monetary policy,
should the economy falter, are limited given that short-term
interest rates are at zero,” Yellen said Nov. 14 in  Washington .  The U.S. sold $70 billion in debt this week, including $16
billion in 30-year bonds that drew lower-than-average demand as
investors favored the three- and 10-year notes sold on signs the
Fed will maintain bond-buying.  “In a recovering economy, rates tend to drift higher over
time,” said  Zach Pandl , a Minneapolis-based senior interest-rate strategist at Columbia Management Investment Advisers,
which oversees $340 billion. “The activist Fed is already
priced in.”  Auction Update  The  bid-to-cover  ratio at the Nov. 14 bond sale, which
gauges demand by comparing the amount bid with the amount
offered, was 2.16, the least since August and less than the
average of 2.48 at the past 10 auctions.  At a $24 billion sale of 10-year notes on Nov. 13 indirect
bidders purchased 47.7 percent of the notes, the highest level
since the June 12 offering of the securities and higher than an
average of 38.7 percent for the past 10 sales. At the $30
billion three-year note sale Nov. 12, investors  bid  3.46 times
the amount of debt on offer, exceeding the average bid-to-cover
ratio, as the measure is known, at the previous 10 auctions of
3.32 times.  The U.S. previously sold $13 billion in 10-year Treasury
inflation protected securities on Sept. 19 at a yield of 0.5
percent, the highest at an auction of the debt since July 2011.
TIPS pay interest at lower rates than regular Treasuries on a
principal amount that’s adjusted based on the Labor Department’s
consumer price index.  To contact the reporter on this story:
