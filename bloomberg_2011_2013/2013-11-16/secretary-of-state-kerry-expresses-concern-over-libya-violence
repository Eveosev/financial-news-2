U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry
expressed concern about clashes in Libya between government-affiliated militias and protesters that the Associated Press
reported to have killed at least 47 people since yesterday.  Soldiers and the militias today attacked a military base
occupied by gunmen in Tripoli, killing four in addition to the
43 protesters who were killed the day before when militias fired
on a crowd urging the breakup of armed groups, the AP said.  The political unrest and clashes in Libya may curtail oil
production in the North African country and push prices higher
next year, the International Energy Agency said Nov. 14.  ``If a free people are going to succeed in forging a
peaceful, secure, and prosperous country with a government based
on the rule of law and respect for human rights, then there can
be no place for this kind of violence in the new Libya,’’ Kerry
said in a statement today.  Libya enjoyed a burst of unity after the 2011 NATO-backed
war that ousted Muammar Qaddafi and during the first fully
democratic vote in more than 50 years a year later. Since then,
militias from Benghazi, Misrata and Zintan, who led fighting
against Qaddafi, have been using force to exact political
concessions and seek a looser federation. Radical Islamists have
meanwhile been attempting to carve out a base in the east.  To contact the reporter on this story:
