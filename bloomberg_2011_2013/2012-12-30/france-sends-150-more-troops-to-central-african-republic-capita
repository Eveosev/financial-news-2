France  sent about 150 more troops to
Bangui to support a peace-keeping mission and help protect the
1,200 French citizens living in the Central African Republic
capital.  The soldiers were deployed yesterday morning from  Gabon  to
join 250 troops already at the Bangui airport, said Michel
Delannoy, a spokesman for the French troops at Camp de Gaulle in
Libreville, Gabon’s capital. Delannoy spoke by telephone today.  France has had armed forces in Gabon since the country’s
independence in 1960. About 900 French soldiers are stationed in
Gabon.  Central African Republic’s President Francois Bozize has
invited rebels to enter a coalition government and they are set
to start peace talks in Gabon, Gabon’s Ministry of  Foreign
Affairs  said in a statement read on national radio today.  Rebel forces say Bozize hasn’t complied with the terms of a
peace agreement in 2007, and oppose his plans to seek a third
term in office. They took up arms on Dec. 10 and continue to
travel toward Bangui.  The U.S. embassy in the Central African Republic suspended
operations last week.  To contact the reporter on this story:
