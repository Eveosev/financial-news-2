U.S. stocks surged on the last day
of the year by the most since 1974 as Congress neared a deal to
avert more than $600 billion in tax increases and spending cuts.  Hewlett-Packard Co. and  Caterpillar Inc. (CAT)  jumped more than
3.2 percent. Investors bought shares of companies most tied to
economic growth, sending technology, energy and materials stocks
at least 2 percent higher. Facebook Inc. climbed 2.7 percent
after Bank of Montreal raised its rating on the company to
outperform from underperform.  The S&P 500 rallied 1.7 percent to 1,426.19 at 4 p.m. in
 New York . The benchmark index finished the year with a 13
percent gain, its best annual performance since 2009. The  Dow
Jones Industrial Average  rose 166.03 points, or 1.3 percent, to
13,104.14 today. More than 6.1 billion shares traded hands,
about in line with the three-month average, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg. U.S. exchanges are closed tomorrow for
the New Year’s holiday.  “It’s still impossible to know what the specific details
are, but this all makes me hopeful that Congress can at least
defuse the ticking time bomb,” said  Jack Ablin , who helps
oversee about $66 billion as chief investment officer of BMO
Private Bank in  Chicago . “Just the fact that Congress can agree
on something is worth celebration.”  Senate Minority Leader  Mitch McConnell  said lawmakers in
Congress are “very, very close” to a deal. He called on
lawmakers to “pass the tax-relief portion” of a budget
agreement being negotiated that would continue lower tax rates
for all but the highest earners.  ‘Within Sight’  President  Barack Obama  said that a deal to avert the so-
called fiscal cliff is “within sight” though it hasn’t been
completed. The U.S.  House of Representatives  doesn’t plan any
votes on the  federal budget  tonight, meaning that Congress for
now will fail to prevent the $600 billion in tax increases and
spending cuts set to start at midnight. Congress could reverse
them by acting retroactively early in 2013.  Under a proposed deal, income tax cuts would be extended
for annual income up to $450,000, said an official who spoke on
condition of anonymity, with rates rising to 39.6 percent on
income above that. Expanded  unemployment insurance  would be
continued through 2013.  The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index, known
as the VIX, plunged 21 percent to 18.02 today for its biggest
drop since August 2011. The index fell 23 percent for 2012, the
most in three years.  The  S&P 500  advanced 13 percent for the year, extending the
bull market rally to 111 percent since March 2009, as financial
stocks and consumer discretionary companies advanced more than
21 percent. The S&P 500 erased its loss for the month today,
rising 0.7 percent.  Budget Showdown  The gauge slipped 1.9 percent last week, the most since
Nov. 9, amid concerns lawmakers weren’t making progress on a
budget deal. The benchmark index fell as much as 7.7 percent
after reaching the highest level since 2007 in September as
Obama’s re-election set up a budget showdown with the
Republican-controlled House of Representatives.  The fiscal cliff could lead to an economic slowdown in
early 2013, according to the  Congressional Budget Office .
Economists forecast the U.S. will expand 2 percent next year,
down from 2.2 percent in 2012, according to the median of 86
projections compiled by Bloomberg.  In  China , manufacturing expanded at a faster pace in
December, according to the final reading of a  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
today. The 51.5 figure, the highest since May 2011, compares
with the 50.9 preliminary reading published Dec. 14 and 50.5 in
November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  German Economy  German  Chancellor Angela Merkel  said the economy will be
more difficult in 2013 than this year.  “The reforms that we’ve agreed on are starting to take
effect,” Merkel said in a New Year’s television speech to the
nation, sent today in advance by e-mail. “Nevertheless, we
still need a lot of patience. The crisis is far from over.”  The Morgan Stanley Cyclical Index jumped 2.2 percent today,
the most since Nov. 19. The Dow Jones Transportation Average
climbed 1.6 percent, and an index of  homebuilders  added 2.5
percent. Technology companies rallied 2.2 percent, the most out
of 10 groups in the S&P 500. Energy shares rose 2.1 percent, and
raw-material shares advanced 2 percent.  Hewlett-Packard rose 4.2 percent to $14.25 for the biggest
gain in the Dow. Caterpillar jumped 3.2 percent to $89.61, while
General Electric Co. advanced 2.7 percent to $20.99.  Facebook rallied 2.7 percent to $26.62. The owner of the
biggest social network was raised to outperform from
underperform by Bank of Montreal analyst Daniel Salmon.  Bristol-Myers  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. rose 2.2 percent to $32.59 after
the blood thinner Eliquis was approved by U.S. regulators.
Eliquis was cleared by the  Food and Drug Administration  for the
prevention of blood clots that develop in patients with the
heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation, the agency said in a
statement on Dec. 28. The approval comes three months before the
FDA’s most-recent March deadline for a ruling on the drug.  PulteGroup Inc., the second-largest builder by market
value, led the  S&P 500 (SPX) ’s rally this year, almost tripling to
$18.16 in 2012. Sprint Nextel Co. and Whirlpool Corp. were the
second- and third-biggest gainers, respectively, each more than
doubling for the year.  Shares of financial companies rose the most in 2012 among
10 industries in the index, gaining 26 percent in the best
annual return for the group since 2003, data compiled by
Bloomberg show. Utility companies were the only group to decline
this year, dropping 2.9 percent.  Record High  The S&P 500 will probably surpass its record high of
1,565.15 in 2013 as bears capitulate and the lure of the four-
year bull market pulls “everyone in the pool,” according to
Laszlo Birinyi, the president of Birinyi Associates Inc. The
benchmark gauge for American equity is within 10 percent of its
record, data compiled by Bloomberg show.  Birinyi is sticking to the bullish forecast he has given to
clients of his Westport, Connecticut-based research firm since
stocks hit a 12-year low following the credit crisis four years
ago. He says the  bull market  that began in March 2009 resembles
advances that pushed equities up more than threefold in the
1980s and fourfold in the 1990s.  “We’re still very comfortable with the market,” Birinyi
said in a telephone interview on Dec. 20. “Our view all along
since 2009 is that we’re in the midst of a protracted bull
market, similar to 1982 and 1992, markets that went on for four
or five years.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
