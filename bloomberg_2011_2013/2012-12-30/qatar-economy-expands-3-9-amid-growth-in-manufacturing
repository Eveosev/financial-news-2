Qatar’s economy expanded 3.9 percent
in the third quarter amid a double-digit rise in manufacturing.  Manufacturing grew 14 percent, backed by a rise in
production of petrochemicals, fertilizer, aluminum and liquid
fuels derived from gas, the  Qatar Statistics Authority  said in
an e-mailed release today.  The world’s biggest producer of liquefied natural gas is
diversifying away from petroleum exports into industries and
financial services after starting its 14th and final gas
liquefaction plant last year. Qatar’s growth will come from non-
oil and gas until about 2015, Frank Harrigan, director of
economic development at Qatar’s planning agency said on Dec. 23.  Mining and quarrying, the largest segment of the economy
including oil and gas, declined 0.8 percent as gas liquefaction
plants were shut for maintenance during the quarter, according
to the report. The construction, transport and communication
industries each expanded 9.4 percent.  Qatar’s economy in current prices expanded 5.9 percent. The
country’s gross domestic product at constant prices rose to
87.04 billion riyals ($23.2 billion) during the quarter from
83.75 billion riyals.  To contact the reporter on this story:
