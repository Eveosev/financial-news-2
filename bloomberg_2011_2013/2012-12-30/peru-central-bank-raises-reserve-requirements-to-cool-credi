Peru ’s central bank increased
 reserve requirements  for banks for the fifth time this year in
an effort to slow credit demand.  The average ratio will rise by 0.25 percentage point for
bank deposits in soles and by 0.75 percent point for bank
deposits in dollars effective next month, the central bank said
in an e-mailed statement today. In October, banks held an
average 17.8 percent of their sol deposits and 40 percent of
their dollar deposits at the central bank, according to the
statement.  “The measure seeks to act preventively to slow the pace of
credit expansion in a context of high liquidity abroad and
exceptionally low interest rates in international markets,” the
central bank said in the statement.  The monetary authority increased the amount of reserves
banks must hold at the central bank by 0.5 percentage points in
May, September and October and by 0.75 percentage points in
November, while keeping its benchmark  interest rate  steady at
4.25 percent.  The greater increase in reserve requirements for dollar-
based  bank deposits  starting next month “seeks to mitigate the
risks involved in foreign currency indebtedness,” the central
bank said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
