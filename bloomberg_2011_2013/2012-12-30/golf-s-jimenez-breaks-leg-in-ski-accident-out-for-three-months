Miguel Angel Jimenez, the oldest
winner on golf’s European Tour, will be out for at least three
months after breaking his leg while skiing.  The 48-year-old fell in  Spain ’s Sierra Nevada mountain
region yesterday and had an operation at the hospital in nearby
Malaga, the European Tour  said on its website.   “I was going down a hill and lost control briefly and when
I fell it was very sore,” Jimenez told the Tour’s website. “I
knew immediately I had broken something.”  The Spaniard last month collected his  19th European Tour
title  at the UBS Hong Kong Open, at age 48 years and 318 days.
The previous oldest winner on the tour was Ireland’s Des Smyth,
who was 48 years and 34 days old when he took the 2001 Madeira
Islands Open. Jimenez had been without a win for two years since
collecting three titles in 2010.  “I was playing very well at the end of the season so it is
obviously not a good time for me to get injured,” Jimenez said.
“When I took up skiing I knew the risks that I was taking but I
love it so much I could not stop.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
