Eric Gordon scored 24 points as the
 New Orleans  Hornets rallied to a 98-95 victory over the
 Charlotte Bobcats  who notched their 18th straight National
Basketball Association loss.  The Bobcats are nearing their franchise-worst 23-game
losing streak set at the end of the 2011-12 season.  The Bobcats blew a 21-point lead, 54-33, that they
accumulated with two minutes, 57 seconds left in the half on
Michael Kidd-Gilchrist’s layup at Time Warner Cable Arena in
 Charlotte .  “We stopped being as aggressive in the second half as the
first,” Kidd-Gilchrist said. “We weren’t attacking.”  The Hornets started to chip away at the Bobcats’ lead,
taking command with just over five minutes remaining.  Gordon had arthroscopic right knee surgery and was playing
in his first game since April 22. He was 5 of 13 from the field
and 12 of 14 from the free-throw line.  “I felt pretty good; I was kind of surprised,” Gordon
told reporters. “Now I’m just going to try to get better and
better from here. I wouldn’t have had a chance to help this team
earlier with my knee, but I’m glad everything is working out
now.”  Hornets coach Monty Williams said Gordon exceeded his
expectations in his first game back from surgery.  “I certainly thought he would be able to help guys and
make guys better,” Williams said. “But I didn’t think he’d
score 24 points. His defense will get better the more he gets in
shape.”  Ryan Anderson scored 19 points and Greivis Vasquez added 16
points for the Hornets (7-23).  Kidd-Gilchrist led the Bobcats with 22 points and Gerald Henderson contributed 19 points.  New Orleans is in last place in the five-team Western
Conference’s Southwest Division, 15 1/2 games behind  San
Antonio . Charlotte is in fourth place in the Eastern
Conference’s  Southeast Division , 14 games behind Miami.  To contact the reporter on this story:
