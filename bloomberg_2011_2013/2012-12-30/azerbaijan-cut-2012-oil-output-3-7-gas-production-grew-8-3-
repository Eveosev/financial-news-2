Azerbaijan , the third-largest oil
producer in the former Soviet Union, cut production in 2012 as
output from the country’s largest oilfield, led by  BP Plc (BP/) ,
declined.  The Caspian Sea nation pumped 43.9 million metric tons of
oil in January through December, a decline of 3.7 percent from
last year, State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan President Rovnaq Abdullayev told reporters today in the capital, Baku.  Natural gas production rose 8.3 percent to 27.9 billion
cubic meters, Abdullayev said.  The Azeri-Chirag-Guneshli field in Azerbaijan’s section of
the Caspian Sea, which provided 78 percent of total output last
year, cut production 12 percent in the first half of 2012,
drawing criticism from Azeri President  Ilham Aliyev .  BP has since replaced regional managers and brought in
technicians to address “challenges” at the field, the U.K.
producer said in October.  BP Chief Executive Bob Dudley met Aliyev in Baku on Dec. 18
and promised to stabilize output next year, Aliyev said in
comments published by state-run daily Azarbaycan on Dec. 19.  To contact the reporter on this story:
