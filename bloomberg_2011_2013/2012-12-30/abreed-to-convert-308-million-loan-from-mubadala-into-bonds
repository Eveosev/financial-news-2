National Central Cooling Co. (TABREED)  will
convert 1.13 billion dirhams ($308 million) of loans from
Mubadala Development Co. into mandatory convertible bonds as
part of a financing accord with the Abu Dhabi investment fund.  Tabreed, as National Central Cooling is known, will
tomorrow issue the bonds that will have “substantially the same
terms” as the securities sold in 2011, the company said in a
 statement  to the Dubai stock exchange today.  Mubadala in 2011 agreed to provide Tabreed long-term
capital of 1.7 billion dirhams in mandatory convertible notes
due 2019 and a loan facility of as much as 1.4 billion dirhams
maturing at the end of this month. Mubadala owns about 15
percent of Tabreed, the Abu Dhabi-based company that builds and
operates cooling and air-conditioning systems, according to data
compiled by Bloomberg.  Tabreed, which appointed Jasim Thabet as chief executive
officer in August, posted a 35 percent increase in third-quarter
profit. The company operates 59 plants in the  United Arab
Emirates  and six facilities in Bahrain, Oman, Qatar and  Saudi
Arabia , according to information provided by Tabreed at the end
of third quarter.  The shares  dropped 0.8 percent at 11:04 a.m. in Dubai
trading. The stock has surged 140 percent this year compared
with a 19 percent gain for the benchmark  DFM General Index. (DFMGI)   To contact the reporter on this story:
