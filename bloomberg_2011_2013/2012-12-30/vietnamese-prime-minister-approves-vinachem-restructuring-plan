Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Tan
Dung approved a plan to restructure Vietnam National Chemical
Group over the next three years, according to a posting on the
governmentâ€™s website.  The company, known as Vinachem, will focus its main
activities on businesses such as making chemicals, fertilizer
and crop-protection products.  While Vinachem is to remain state-controlled and a leader
in its primary businesses, the company would sell stakes in as
many as 13 units by 2015 and reduce its holdings in others,
according to  the posting .  Vinachem will focus on meeting domestic fertilizer demand
and helping to ensure national food security, according to a
 company profile  on its website.  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
