David Beckham  has held talks with
Shanghai Shenhua over a possible move to the Chinese soccer
club, The People reported.  The 37-year-old former England midfielder, who ended a six-
year stint at the Los Angeles Galaxy this month, is likely to be
offered a salary of at least 250,000 pounds ($403,800) a week by
Shanghai Shenhua,  the newspaper said , citing people it didn’t
identify.  Beckham is tempted by the opportunity to promote soccer in
a country where it has a lower profile and will continue
negotiations when he returns from his Christmas holiday, the
paper reported, citing an unidentified person. He said in
November he wanted “one last challenge.”  While the former Manchester United and Real Madrid player
has also been linked with Paris Saint-Germain and Monaco, the
chances of a move to France have faded, the newspaper said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
