Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers
will miss his club’s Premier League soccer match at Queens Park
Rangers today with a “likely virus.”  Rodgers has been sent home, along with Glen Driscoll, the
club’s head of performance, and goalkeeper Brad Jones, Liverpool
said in a  statement  on its website.  “They are not fit to be at the match and any contact with
the rest of the squad could cause the bug to spread to more of
the playing staff,” club doctor Zaf Iqbal said in the
statement.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
