Malfunctioning brakes may have
caused a plane to crash while landing at Moscow’s Vnukovo
airport yesterday, killing five, Interfax  reported .  A preliminary investigation has found that the pilots
attempted to use all of the Tu-204’s brake systems while landing
and were unable to prevent the plane from sliding through a
barrier and onto a nearby highway, the Moscow-based news service
reported, citing an unidentified person working on the state’s
emergency response team.  The Interstate Aviation Committee has received the plane’s
flight-deck recording equipment, known as black boxes, and is
continuing to investigate the cause of the crash, the Moscow-
based organization said on its  website  today.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
