The New York Jets will fire
offensive coordinator  Tony Sparano  after a 6-10 season marked by
an unsettled quarterback position,  ESPN reports , citing
unidentified people familiar with the situation.  The Jets failed to score a touchdown in today’s 28-9
season-ending loss to the Buffalo Bills. They had entered the
final week of the regular season with an offense that ranked
30th out of 32 National Football League teams in total yards.  Jets former first-round draft pick Mark Sanchez was benched
in Week 16 in favor of second-year quarterback  Greg McElroy ,
while  Tim Tebow  was used sparingly at the position after being
acquired in an offseason trade with Denver. Sanchez returned to
start today’s game after McElroy suffered a concussion and
finished the season with 27 turnovers, including 18
interceptions and nine lost fumbles.  Sparano was hired by the Jets in January to replace  Brian Schottenheimer , who resigned after the team missed the playoffs
a year ago with an 8-8 record. Sparano previously had a 29-33
record over three-plus seasons as coach of the Miami Dolphins.  To contact the reporter on this story:
