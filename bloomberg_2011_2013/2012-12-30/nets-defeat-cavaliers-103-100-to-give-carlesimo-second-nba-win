Brook Lopez had 35 points and 11
rebounds as the Brooklyn Nets defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers
103-100 to give interim coach P.J. Carlesimo his second straight
National Basketball Association win.  “They played more good minutes of this last 96 and we won
two games, so there’s no question they’re in a better place,”
Carlesimo said referring to the team’s two-game road trip to
visit the San Antonio Spurs and Oklahoma City Thunder.  Deron Williams and  Joe Johnson  each scored 15 points last
night for the Nets (16-14), who are in second place in the five-
team Eastern Conference’s  Atlantic Division , five games behind
the New York Knicks.  “This can start something, so for us to get these two
wins, we’ve got a little confidence going on the road, and we’ll
ride this confidence into San Antonio and try to get us another
win,” Johnson told reporters.  The Nets had a 61-53 halftime lead on their home court at
Barclays Center.  C.J. Miles came off the bench to score 33 points and
Tristan Thompson had 17 points and 15 rebounds for the Cavaliers
(7-25).  “We’re playing hard,” Miles said. “It’s just growing
pains and learning how to play.”  Cleveland is in last place in the five-team Eastern
Conference’s Central Division, 11 games behind the  Milwaukee
Bucks ,  Chicago Bulls  and  Indiana Pacers .  To contact the reporter on this story:
