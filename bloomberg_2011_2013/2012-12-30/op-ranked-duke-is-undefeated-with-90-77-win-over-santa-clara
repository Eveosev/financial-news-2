Seth Curry scored 31 points as top-
ranked  Duke University  earned its 12th straight victory this
season with a 90-77 college basketball victory over  Santa Clara 
University.  In other games yesterday involving the top five teams, it
was No. 2 Michigan 88, Central Michigan 73 and No. 4 Louisville
80, Kentucky 77.  At Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham, Mason Plumlee had 22
points and 13 rebounds for the undefeated Blue Devils, who
trailed 45-41 with 16 minutes left in the game.  Curry hit two 3-pointers and followed with three layups
during the 26-5 run as the Blue Devils surged ahead of the
Broncos. With eight minutes, 30 seconds left to play, Duke
pulled ahead 67-50.  “Our team did a great job of executing in the halfcourt,”
Curry told reporters. “I was able to score from behind the line
and attacking the rim, so I was able to mix it up a little
bit.”  Kevin Foster  had 20 points and Evan Roguemore added 17 for
Santa Clara, which fell to 11-3 and lost its first road game of
the season.  “I hit a couple threes, so of course, they were going to
start denying me,” Foster said. “They made it hard to get
catches. At the same time, we still made plays and we fed off of
that.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
