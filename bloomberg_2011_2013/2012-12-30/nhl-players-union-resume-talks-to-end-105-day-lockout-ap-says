National Hockey League  and players’
union officials are having conference calls to discuss the
latest contract offer to end the 106-day lockout.  The discussions began yesterday, said league spokesman John
Dellapina in an e-mail. As of late last night, there were no
plans for formal face-to-face talks today, he said.  The National Hockey League Players’ Association is
considering the league’s offer that was submitted Dec. 27. The
NHL is seeking a deal by Jan. 11 to allow for training camps to
begin the next day with a 48-game season set to start Jan. 19.  The two sides last talked Dec. 13 when federal mediators
were present. The league and union met Dec. 6 in their own
session that ended when the union made a counterproposal,
violating the league’s offer that stipulated no further
bargaining.  Under the latest offer, the league proposed raising the
limit of individual free-agent contracts to six years from five
years or seven years if a team re-signs its own player, the
 Associated Press  reported, citing a person familiar with the
document. It also offered to raise the salary variance from one
year to another to 10 percent from 5 percent.  The latest proposal is for 10 years, running through the
2021-22 season, with both sides having the right to opt out
after eight years, AP said.  The league has canceled 625 games, or 51 percent of the
season, through Jan. 14. In 1994-95, an NHL lockout ended Jan.
11 and a 48-game schedule began on Jan. 20. A lockout wiped out
the 2004-05 season, the only time an entire schedule was lost to
a labor dispute in a major North American sports league.  The sides are arguing over how to split revenue and other
issues, including salary arbitration and the length of
unrestricted free agency. League revenue grew to $3.3 billion
last season, up 50 percent from $2.2 billion in 2003-04.  Under the previous agreement, players received 57 percent,
or $1.9 billion, of the income. The remaining $1.4 billion, or
43 percent, was shared among the league’s 30 team owners. The
league this time has offered a 50-50 split.  To contact the reporter on this story:
