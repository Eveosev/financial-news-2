Hedge funds  cut bullish commodity
bets to a six-month low as mounting concern that slowing
economic growth will erode demand drove prices toward the first
fourth-quarter retreat since the global recession.  Speculators reduced net-long  positions  across 18 U.S.
futures and options by 11 percent to 675,625 million contracts
in the week ended Dec. 24, the lowest since June 19, U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Gold holdings
reached a four-month low, while those for copper dropped for the
first time in five weeks. Investors are the most bearish on
 natural gas  since May.  The Standard & Poor’s GSCI Spot Index of 24 raw materials
fell 2.9 percent since Sept. 30, the first retreat for the
period since 2008.  Japan  and the 17-nation euro area are already
back in recessions and the  Congressional Budget Office  has
warned the U.S. risks going the same way unless policy makers
agree on averting more than $600 billion of automatic tax
increases and spending cuts scheduled to start next month.  “We don’t have sustained, healthy global growth,” said
Walter “Bucky” Hellwig, who helps manage $17 billion of assets
at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham,  Alabama . “It’s easier
to not to make that bullish bet and either just sit on the
sidelines or go on the short side of a ledger.”  2012 Returns  The S&P GSCI is up 0.3 percent this year. The MSCI All-
Country World Index of equities climbed 13 percent, while the
dollar slid 0.5 percent against a basket of six trading
partners. Treasuries returned 2.3 percent, a Bank of America
Corp. index shows.  The Conference Board’s index of U.S. sentiment fell to 65.1

Bloomberg’s survey of economists. Sales of new houses rose less
than forecast in November, the Commerce Department said Dec. 27.  The French economy grew less than initially reported in the
third quarter, while Japan’s industrial output in November
tumbled more than forecast to the lowest since the aftermath of
the 2011 earthquake, separate government reports showed Dec. 28.
Contracts outstanding across the members of the S&P GSCI are
headed for the biggest monthly contraction since June.  Stimulus Measures  Increasing government and central bank stimulus measures
will bolster commodity demand, said  Evan Smith , who helps manage
about $500 million of assets at U.S. Global Investors Inc. in
 San Antonio .  Japan’s premier Shinzo Abe said Dec. 26 he would push for
“bold monetary easing.” Minutes of the  Bank of Japan (8301) ’s
November meeting showed that a board member suggested conducting
open-ended asset purchases. The  Federal Reserve  said Dec. 12 it
would buy $45 billion of  Treasury securities  a month from
January, adding to $40 billion a month of existing mortgage-debt
purchases. The  European Central Bank  and  China  have also pledged
to do more to bolster growth.  Chinese industrial companies’ profits rose for a third
month in November, the National Bureau of Statistics said Dec.
27. The Asian country, the biggest consumer of commodities from
copper to soybeans, is poised to snap a seven-quarter slowdown
as growth accelerates to 7.8 percent in the three months ending
today, according to the median of 35 economist estimates
compiled by Bloomberg. They expect China to keep accelerating
for at least the next six months.  China Growth  Manufacturing in China expanded at a faster pace in
December, according to the final reading of a  Purchasing
Managers ’ Index from HSBC Holdings Plc and Markit Economics
released today. The 51.5 figure is the highest since May 2011
and compares with the 50.9 preliminary reading published Dec. 14
and 50.5 in November. A reading above 50 indicates expansion.  “There is evidence that the Chinese economic deceleration
has now turned,” said Chad Morganlander, a  Florham Park , New
Jersey-based fund manager at Stifel Nicolaus & Co., which
oversees about $130 billion of assets. “Global growth
expectations will slowly start improving in the second and third
quarter, which will gin up commodity prices.”  Money managers withdrew $188 million from commodity funds
in the week ended Dec. 26, according to  Cameron Brandt , the
director of research for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based EPFR
Global, which tracks money flows. Gold and precious-metal funds
had a net outflow of $451 million.  Investors cut bullish wagers on copper by 39 percent to

year, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. said in a Dec. 5 report.  A  measure  of net-longs for 11 U.S. farm goods tumbled 11
percent to 402,260 contracts, the lowest since June 12, CFTC
data show. The S&P GSCI Agriculture Index of eight farm products
slumped 1.1 percent last week, the fourth consecutive loss.  Funds are holding a net-short position in wheat of 11,899
contracts, up from 6,433 a week earlier and the most bearish
outlook since May. As of Dec. 20, U.S. exporters shipped 13.2
million tons for delivery in the 12 months that started June 1,
13 percent less than a year earlier, U.S. Department of
Agriculture  data  show.  “Commodities are getting caught in a risk-asset slide,”
said  Jack Ablin , who helps oversee about $66 billion as chief
investment officer of BMO Private Bank in  Chicago . “Traders
want to coast through the end of the year flat instead of
watching prices bounce around like a Ping-Pong ball.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
