 Four people suspected of being
members of the Nigerian Islamic militant group Boko Haram and a
police officer were killed yesterday in a shootout in the
northeastern town of Potiskum, Yobe State.  Fifty-one other Boko Haram suspects were arrested by
security forces, the spokesman of the Joint Task Force, Lt. Eli
Lazarus, said today in an e-mail statement. One soldier was
injured, he said.  Security officials captured rifles and other guns and
ammunition after the clash, Lazarus said. Other items recovered
were gas cylinders and several improvised explosive devices,
according to the statement.  To contact the reporter on this story:
