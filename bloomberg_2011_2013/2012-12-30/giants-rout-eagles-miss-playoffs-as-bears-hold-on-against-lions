The  Washington Redskins  beat the
Dallas Cowboys 28-18 in the final game of the regular season to
win their first division title since 1999 and claim the last of
the  National Football League ’s 12 playoff berths.  The  Minnesota Vikings  also claimed the final wild-card
playoff berth with a 37-34 win over the Green Bay Packers
yesterday, when the Cowboys,  Chicago Bears  and defending  Super
Bowl  champion New York Giants all fell short of the postseason.  Rookie Alfred Morris rushed for 200 yards and three
touchdowns last night at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland, as
the Redskins (10-6) finished the season with a seventh straight
win to complete the playoff lineup.  Washington will host the  Seattle Seahawks  (11-5) on Jan. 6
in the first round of the NFL postseason. The Redskins are
listed 2 1/2-point underdogs, according to the Las Vegas Hotel’s
Super Book, even though Seattle is 3-5 on the road this season.  Minnesota (10-6) will face the Packers again to open the
postseason on Jan. 5, with Green Bay favored by 7 1/2 points.
Vikings running back  Adrian Peterson  ran for 199 yards yesterday
to finish nine yards shy of the NFL single-season rushing record
of 2,105 set by Eric Dickerson in 1984.  The Houston Texans (12-4) host the Cincinnati Bengals
(10-6) the same day in the American Football Conference, while
the Indianapolis Colts (11-5) visit the  Baltimore Ravens  (10-6)
the following day. The Texans are 4 1/2-point favorites and the
Ravens are listed as 6 1/2-point favorites at home.  The Atlanta Falcons (13-3) and San Francisco 49ers (11-4-1)
earned the top two seeds in the NFC and get a week of rest
during the first round of the playoffs.  Top Seeds  The  Denver Broncos  (13-3) and  New England Patriots  (12-4)
got first-round byes in the AFC.  The Giants are the first Super Bowl champions since the
2009 Pittsburgh Steelers to miss the playoffs, leaving New York
without a team in the postseason for the first time since 2003.  The Giants routed the Philadelphia Eagles 42-7 yesterday to
finish 9-7, yet needed the Bears, Vikings and Cowboys to all
lose. They were eliminated from postseason contention minutes
after their win in East Rutherford, New Jersey, as Chicago held
on for a 26-24 victory in Detroit.  “You never rely on anyone else in this business,” Giants
coach  Tom Coughlin , whose team had lost five of its previous
seven games, told reporters. “You have to take care of your own
business and we certainly had our chances.”  The Bears were eliminated from playoff contention when the
Vikings ended the Packers’ four-game winning streak on a 29-yard
field goal by rookie Blair Walsh as time expired. The winning
kick was set up by a 26-yard run by Peterson, who finished with
the second-highest rushing total in NFL history.  Peterson’s Focus  “I told myself to come to this game and focus on one
thing, winning and doing my job to contribute,” said Peterson,
who had a career-high 34 carries. “If it happened, it would
have come to me, but I didn’t want to focus on it at all. I went
out and played my game and accomplished what we wanted to. We’re
in the playoffs. We get to fight another week.”  The Redskins then completed the playoff lineup behind
Morris, who broke Clinton Portis’s franchise record for rushing
yards in a season. Morris finishes with 1,613 yards on the
season and had touchdown runs of 17 and 32 yards before
clinching the win with a 1-yard scoring plunge with 1:15 left.  “I could have never imagined coming here during my rookie
year and doing what I’ve been able to do,” Morris said. “It’s
humbling. It’s better than my wildest dreams.  Fellow rookie Robert Griffin III passed for 100 yards and
rushed for 63 yards and a score for Washington, which becomes
the fifth team to make the NFL playoffs after a 3-6 start and
the first since the 1996  Jacksonville Jaguars .  Broncos’ Win  The Broncos locked up the No. 1 playoff seed in the AFC
with a 38-3 rout over the  Kansas City Chiefs  coupled with the
Texans’ 28-16 loss in Indianapolis.  Peyton Manning  threw three
touchdown passes for the Broncos, who get a chance to play
postseason games at home until the Super Bowl.  The Colts’ win came as coach Chuck Pagano was on the
sideline for the first time since being diagnosed with a
treatable form of leukemia about three months ago.  The Patriots clinched the AFC’s No. 2 seed and a first-
round bye by beating the Miami Dolphins 28-0, while the Bengals
beat the Ravens 23-17 yesterday.  The 49ers captured the NFC West title with a 27-13 victory
over the  Arizona  Cardinals, a win that also locked up a first-
round bye with the Packers’ loss. The Seahawks, denied a chance
at the division title with the 49ers’ win, defeated the St.
Louis Rams 20-13 on Russell Wilson’s 1-yard touchdown run with
1:45 remaining.  Falcons Fall  The Falcons, who had already gained the top seed in the
NFC, finished the regular season with a 22-17 loss to the  Tampa
Bay Buccaneers .  Also in Week 17 it was Buffalo 28, the New York Jets 9;
Tennessee 38, Jacksonville 20; Carolina 44, New Orleans 38;
Pittsburgh 24, Cleveland 10; and San Diego 24, Oakland 21.  The Giants stormed to a 35-7 lead against the Eagles as  Eli Manning  threw four of his five touchdown passes in the first
half in East Rutherford, New Jersey. It might have been the
final game for Eagles coach  Andy Reid , who NFL.com reported was
told he’d be fired after the season.  The win wasn’t enough for the Giants, whose season ended
when the Bears held on for a victory in Detroit after having
their 17-point lead cut to two in the fourth quarter.  The Vikings controlled their playoff fate -- not needing
losses by any other clubs to reach the postseason -- and
withstood a 365-yard, four-touchdown performance by Packers
quarterback  Aaron Rodgers .  Green Bay twice rallied to tie the game in the fourth
quarter before a 26-yard run by Peterson set up the winning
field goal. Peterson, who a year ago underwent surgery to repair
two torn ligaments in his left knee, finishes with the second-
highest rushing total in NFL history.  To contact the reporter on this story:
