The  U.S. Senate  confirmed Carol Galante as head of the  Federal Housing Administration , the
agency she has spent more than a year running as acting FHA
commissioner.  The vote to confirm her nomination as an assistant
secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development was
69-24. Sixty votes were needed under the terms of an agreement
between majority Democrats and the minority Republicans who
opposed her confirmation.  One Republican,  Bob Corker  of Tennessee, had objected to
the nomination until recently. Earlier this month, he said he
was now convinced that Galante would improve the finances of the
troubled government mortgage insurer.  Those steps are to include limiting borrowers with credit
scores under 620 to debt that is worth no more than 43 percent
of their income unless they make a large down payment or have
other money in reserve.  To contact the reporter on this story:
