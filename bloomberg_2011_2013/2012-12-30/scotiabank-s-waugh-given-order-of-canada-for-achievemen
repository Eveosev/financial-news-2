Richard Waugh , chief executive
officer of the  Bank of Nova Scotia , was named an officer of the
Order of Canada for helping strengthen the banking industry.  Waugh is among 91 recipients of the award from the governor
general that recognizes “significant achievement and remarkable
service.” The chief of Canada’s third-largest lender was
recognized for “his contributions to strengthening the
financial-services industry in Canada and abroad,” David Johnston, Governor General of Canada, said in a statement.  The order was established in 1967 by  Queen Elizabeth II .  Others named for the honor today include Phil Fontaine,
aboriginal Canadian leader, and the gold-medal winning Olympic
coach Daniele Sauvageau.  Waugh, 65, relinquished the role of bank president on Oct.
31. He was replaced by  Brian Porter  and continued on as CEO.  To contact the reporter on this story:
