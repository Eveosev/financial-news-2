U.S. stocks surged on the last day
of a year by the most since 1974 as lawmakers neared a budget
deal to prevent more than $600 billion in spending cuts and tax
increases. Treasuries slid while gold rose.  The Standard & Poor’s 500 Index jumped 1.7 percent to
1,426.19 at 4 p.m. in  New York  for its biggest gain since Nov.
19. The Stoxx  Europe 600 (SXXP)  Index closed 0.3 percent higher. Ten-
year Treasury yields were up six basis points at 1.76 percent,

capping the biggest annual drop versus the dollar in seven
years. Gold extended a 12th annual gain, the longest streak
since at least 1920.  The S&P 500 completed a 13 percent gain for 2012, its best

negotiations failed to produce an agreement, then rallied on
reports of progress. Benchmark indexes climbed to their highs of
the session after Senate Republican Leader  Mitch McConnell  said
lawmakers reached an agreement on all tax issues and were
“very, very close” to a deal to avert the so called fiscal
cliff.  “This all makes me hopeful that Congress can at least
defuse the ticking time bomb,” said  Jack Ablin , who helps
oversee about $66 billion as chief investment officer of BMO
Private Bank in  Chicago . “Any positive news coming out of
 Washington  is going to be taken as pretty bullish among
investors who already have very low expectations. Just the fact
that Congress can agree on something is worth celebration.”  ‘Within Sight’  President  Barack Obama  said that a deal to avert the so-
called fiscal cliff is “within sight” though it hasn’t been
completed. The U.S. House of Representatives doesn’t plan any
votes on the  budget tonight, meaning that Congress for now will
fail to prevent the $600 billion in tax increases and spending
cuts set to start at midnight. Congress could reverse them by
acting retroactively early in 2013.  Today’s late-day rally left the  S&P 500  with a gain of 0.7
