Senate Democrats  rejected the latest
Republican offer on averting U.S. tax-and-spending changes set
to start in two days, according to two Senate Democratic aides
close to the negotiations.  Democrats turned down the offer because Republicans wanted
to use a new inflation measure for calculating Social Security
cost-of-living increases as part of an interim deal, the two
aides said.  The aides, who requested anonymity to discuss the private
talks, said Democrats view the latest offer as a setback to
negotiations between Senate Majority Leader  Harry Reid , a
Democrat, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican.  Reid and McConnell are scheduled to brief their members at
3 p.m. Washington time on the status of talks, and one of the
aides said Reid would tell Democratic senators that he and
McConnell are moving farther apart from, rather than closer to,
a deal.  President  Barack Obama  had offered to move to that
inflation measure in earlier talks with House Speaker John
Boehner, a Republican.  To contact the reporter on this story:
