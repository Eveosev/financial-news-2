Avigdor Liberman, who resigned as
Israeli foreign minister two weeks ago, was indicted today in
the Jerusalem Magistrate’s Court on charges of fraud and breach
of trust.  The charges come less than a month before Israeli general
elections scheduled for Jan. 22. Liberman merged his Yisrael
Beitenu party with Prime Minister  Benjamin Netanyahu ’s Likud
faction two months ago to form the joint Likud-Beitenu list,
which leads in voter surveys.  The case stems from Liberman’s involvement in the
appointment of Ze’ev Ben Arye as  Israel ’s ambassador to  Latvia ,
according to a copy of the indictment sent by e-mail from the
Justice Ministry. Ben Arye, a former envoy to Belarus, had
allegedly passed confidential information to Liberman concerning
a criminal investigation being conducted there against him.  Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon, who was ousted from
Yisrael Beitenu by Liberman earlier this month, is expected to
serve as a key prosecution witness, Haaretz newspaper reported.  A guilty verdict could disqualify Liberman from holding
political office in the next government, depending on the
severity of the sentence.  To contact the reporter on this story:
