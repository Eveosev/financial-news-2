China  plans to allow brokerages and
insurers’ asset management units to set up and manage mutual
funds available to the public as regulators seek to bolster the
equities market.  Draft  rules  posted on the China Securities Regulatory
Commission’s website today show the companies need to have at
least 20 billion  yuan  ($3.2 billion) in assets under management
and demonstrate they have been profitable for the past three
years.  Managers of private funds will also be eligible, provided
they have no less than 10 million yuan in paid-in capital and
have managed a minimum 3 billion yuan in any of the past three
years, according to the draft rules. China has this year boosted
quotas for foreign institutional investors and lifted the
investment ceiling on overseas central banks to encourage long-
term investors in the nation’s  stock market .  “The three types of institutions can use their advantages
in funding, channels, client base as well as investment and
research abilities to attract various funds into the capital
market,” the CSRC said in a statement. “It will help increase
the ranks of institutional investors and promote the long-term
stable and healthy development of the capital market.”  To contact Bloomberg News staff for this story:
