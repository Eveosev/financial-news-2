A Tehran-based newspaper banned by
Iranian officials for publishing a cartoon deemed offensive will
“soon” resume publishing,  Donya-e-Eqtesad  reported, citing the
daily’s editor-in-chief, Mehdi Rahmanian.  Shargh, which was shut in September after being accused by
the Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance of printing an
“insulting” caricature of Iranian fighters in the 1980-1988
war with  Iraq , has been cleared in a Tehran court of all three
charges against it, Donya reported.  Shargh had been charged with “publishing material against
the truth, violating regulations against the country’s national
security and disrespecting former fighters,” the Tehran-based
daily said.  The illustration had appeared on the last page of the
newspaper during the Islamic Republic’s annual Defense Week in
September. It depicted men walking blindfolded in a line, each
tightening the blindfold of the person preceding him, and bore
no caption. It drew criticism from some 120 parliamentary
members, including lawmaker Hamid Resaei, who said it portrayed
soldiers going to war with their eyes shut.  It isn’t the first time publication of Shargh has been
halted. The newspaper was outlawed in August 2007 for publishing
an interview that Iranian officials said promoted homosexuality,
and the year before for printing a cartoon of a donkey that was
seen as ridiculing President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.  To contact the reporter on this story:
