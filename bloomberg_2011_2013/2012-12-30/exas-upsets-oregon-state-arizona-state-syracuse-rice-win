David Ash passed for two touchdowns
in the fourth quarter to rally No. 23 University of Texas from a
10-point deficit and upset No. 13 Oregon State University 31-27
in college football’s Valero Alamo Bowl.  In other bowl games yesterday, it was  Arizona  State 62,
Navy 28 in the Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl; Syracuse 38, West
Virginia 14 in the New Era Pinstripe Bowl; Rice 33, Air Force 14

16 in the Buffalo Wild Wings Bowl.  At the Alamodome in  San Antonio , Ash hit Johnathan Grey
with a 15-yard touchdown pass with eight-minutes, 18 seconds
left in the game, and then connected with Marquise Goodwin on a
36-yard pass for the winning touchdown six minutes later.  “I told them this it wasn’t going to be easy, but I told
them this game was ours and we would win it,” Texas coach Mack
Brown told reporters. “This one is really special.”  Oregon State (9-4) took a 20-10 halftime lead with
touchdown runs by Storm Woods and Terron Wood and two field
goals by Trevor Romaine. Woods ran two yards for a touchdown to
put the Beavers ahead 27-17 in the third quarter.  Ash, who ran 11 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter,
