The BP Plc-led Shah Deniz natural-
gas development will cost as much as $30 billion, compared with
a previous estimate of $25 billion, said Rovnaq Abdullayev,
president of State Oil Co. of Azerbaijan, or Socar.  “In total, the second phase of Shah Deniz will cost $28
billion to $30 billion,” Abdullayev told reporters today in the
Azeri capital of Baku.  BP is developing the Shah Deniz field in partnership with
Socar,  Statoil ASA (STL) ,  Total SA (FP) , OAO Lukoil, Turkiye Petrolleri AO
and Naftiran Intertrade Co. European Union countries are seeking
a supply link with the Caspian to diversify away from  Russia ,
provider of about a quarter of the EU’s natural gas, after
disruptions of deliveries sent through Ukraine during disputes
between the two nations.  The Shah Deniz partners plan to make the final investment
decision on the second phase of Shah Deniz phase at the end of
2013, Abdullayev said. The partners also approved a plan to
spend $6 billion on construction of platforms and infrastructure
next year, the Socar president said, adding that the first gas
from Shah Deniz will reach the EU by the end of 2017 or in the
first quarter of 2018.  To contact the reporter on this story:
