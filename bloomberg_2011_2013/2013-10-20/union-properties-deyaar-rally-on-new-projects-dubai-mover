Union Properties (UPP)  PJSC and  Deyaar
Development PJSC (DEYAAR)  surged to their highest since 2009 as new
projects fueled investor bets on the Dubai-based developers
emerging from restructurings.  Union Properties shares surged 8.8 percent to 0.956
dirhams, its highest close since November 2009 in Dubai. Deyaar
climbed 5.3 percent to 0.71 dirhams. The  Dubai Financial Market
General Index (DFMGI)  gained 2.6 percent today as trading resumed after
a holiday.  The emirate’s two smallest publicly traded builders are
starting new projects after a liquidity squeeze following
Dubai’s property crash forced them to focus on restructuring
debt. Union Properties on Oct. 8 said it sold two hotels and
plans to expand a residential development. Deyaar’s chief
executive officer on Oct. 9 said the company sold an  office
tower  in the Business Bay district for 141 million dirhams ($38
million) and is working on plans to build two towers there.  “Those developers are starting new projects and benefiting
from the increases in rents and prices” across Dubai, Tariq Qaqish, head of asset management at Dubai-based Al Mal Capital
PSC, who manages about 500 million dirhams, said by phone. “The
persistence of low  interest rates  is positive for real estate as
an asset class.”  The central bank hasn’t changed interest rates since
February 2009 when it reduced the repurchasing rate by 50 basis
points to 1 percent.  Stock markets in the  United Arab Emirates , which includes
bourses in Dubai, reopened today after closing last week for Eid
Al Adha holiday.  Deyaar, which is 76 percent below its 2007 high of 2.99
dirhams, has soared 102 percent this year. Union Properties,
which is 82 percent below its June 2005 peak, has jumped 142
percent this year.  To contact the reporter on this story:
