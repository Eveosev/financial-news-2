Tre Mason scored on a five-yard run
in the final two minutes as No. 24 Auburn University defeated
Johnny Manziel and seventh-ranked  Texas  A&M University 45-41 in
college football.  In other games yesterday involving teams ranked in the
Associated Press Writers’ Poll top 10, it was No. 1 Alabama 52,
Arkansas 0; No. 2 Oregon 62, Washington State 38; No. 5 Florida
State 51, No. 3 Clemson 14; No. 4 Ohio State 34, Iowa 24;
Mississippi 27, No. 6 Louisiana State 24; and No. 13 Stanford
24, No. 9 California at Los Angeles 10.  At Kyle Field in College Station, Texas, Auburn quarterback
Nick Marshall passed for 236 yards and two touchdowns and
carried 20 times for 100 yards and two scores as the Tigers
improved to 6-1 overall and 3-1 in the Southeastern Conference.  “Our plan was to be in the game at halftime and wear them
down in the second half,” said Auburn coach Gus Malzahn whose
team was down 24-17 at halftime. “I think for the most part it
worked.”  Trailing by 10 after Aggies’ Josh Lambo kicked a 20-yard
field goal less than one minute into the fourth quarter,
Marshall scored on a 13-yard run and Cameron Artis-Payne
sprinted two yards to give Auburn a 38-34 lead.  Manziel, who missed a drive in the fourth quarter as he
left the field with a shoulder injury, returned to put the
Aggies ahead 41-38 on a one-yard plunge with five minutes, five
seconds left in the game.  Mason, who rushed for 178 yards on 27 carries, put the
Tigers back in front with one minute, 19 seconds left.  “We did something a lot of people didn’t think we could
do,” Mason said.  Manziel, the reigning Heisman Trophy winner, completed 28
of 38 passes for 454 yards and four touchdowns to Mike Evans,
who had 11 receptions for 287 yards. He rushed 48 yards for a
fifth score for Texas A&M, which fell to 5-2 overall and 2-2 in
the SEC.  “We didn’t make enough plays at the end of the day,” said
Texas A&M coach Kevin Sumlin. “We had our opportunities --
couldn’t make a play.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
