Kang Sung-Hoon scored a final-round
69, 2-under par, to win golf’s Korea Open by one shot. Former
world No. 1 Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland hit a 67 to finish
tied for second.  South Korea’s Kang finished on 4-under at the Woo Jeong
Hills Country Club near Cheonan, south of Seoul.  Overnight leader Kim Hyung-Tae of South Korea was among
five players tied for second after incurring a two-stroke
penalty for grounding his club in a hazard.  South Korea’s Jin Jeong defeated  Ross Fisher  of England at
the first playoff hole to win the Perth International in
Australia. They’d finished tied on 10-under par in regulation
play.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
