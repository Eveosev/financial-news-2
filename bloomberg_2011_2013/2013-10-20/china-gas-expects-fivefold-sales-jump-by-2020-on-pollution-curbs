China Gas Holdings Ltd. (384) , which
supplies natural gas to 195 cities in Asia’s biggest economy,
expects sales will jump as much as fivefold by 2020 as the
nation pushes for wider use of the fuel to replace coal.  Deliveries may reach 40 billion cubic meters from an
estimated 8 billion cubic meters this year, Chief Financial
Officer Eric Leung said during a group interview at the
company’s Northwest Management Center in Shaanxi’s Baoji city on
Oct. 17. Growing sales will gradually push dividend payouts
toward 30 percent, he said, from  23 percent  in the year ended
March 31.  Air pollution in  China ’s northern cities including Beijing
and Tianjin exceeded hazardous levels several times this year,
prompting the government to take steps to curb the burning of
coal. The nation plans to more than double the capacity of gas-fired  power plants  to 56 gigawatts by end-2015 from 26.4
gigawatts in 2010, data compiled by Bloomberg Industries show.  “Those policies will greatly help our businesses,
especially in expanding the number of our commercial and
industrial users,” said Leung. “We are very confident about
the consumption growth as long as our upstream supplies can be
guaranteed.”  Natural gas is distributed mostly at fixed prices, causing
earnings to move in tandem with sales, he said. China Gas, which
sold 6.8 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the year ended
March 31, expects volumes to touch 8.5 billion cubic meters in
2014 and 10 billion cubic meters in 2015, according to Leung.  Stock Rises  The company’s  shares  rose as much as 4.3 percent to HK$8.67
and traded at HK$ 8.59 as of 2:08 p.m. in  Hong Kong . They have
doubled in the past year, compared with an 8.8 percent gain in
the city’s benchmark  Hang Seng Index .  GAIL India Ltd. (GAIL)  raised HK$492 million by selling 60 million
shares, or 1.2 percent of China Gas’ total shares, this month,
according to terms for the deal obtained by Bloomberg. India’s
biggest gas-marketing company still owns 150 million China Gas
shares after the sale, data compiled by Bloomberg show. China
Gas wouldn’t speculate on why GAIL sold the shares, said Leung.  “If you look at our shareholding structure, major
shareholders mostly purchased their stakes gradually from the
open markets,” he said. “I see that as an endorsement of our
ability to deliver for shareholders.”  Beijing Enterprises Holdings Ltd. (392) , which supplies natural
gas to Beijing, announced in July it will take over a 22 percent
stake in China Gas from its state-owned parent Beijing
Enterprises Group to become the biggest shareholder. The company
increased its stake last year after  China Petroleum & Chemical
Corp. (386)  and  ENN Energy Holdings Ltd. (2688)  made a takeover offer for
China Gas.  To contact the reporter on this story:
