Clermont Auvergne, last year’s
losing finalist, scored three tries in a 23-16 win over
Harlequins today in rugby’s Heineken Cup.  Lee Byrne, Wesley Fofana and Thierry Lacrampe went over for
Clermont, which led 20-13 at halftime.  Tom Williams  got
Harlequins’ try.  Also today, Northampton beat Ospreys 27-16, Perpignan had a
31-14 victory over Edinburgh, and Exeter lost 20-16 at Glasgow.  Among other results earlier this weekend, Cardiff upset
defending champion Toulon 19-15 and Saracens lost by a point to
Toulouse.  Leinster, Exeter, Toulouse, Scarlets, Ulster and Perpignan
lead the six pools after the second round of games. The pool
winners and best two runners-up advance to the quarterfinals.  England  and  France ’s top clubs have proposed a breakaway
European tournament to replace the Heineken Cup from next
season.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
