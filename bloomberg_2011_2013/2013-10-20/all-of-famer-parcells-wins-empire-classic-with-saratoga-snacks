Four-year-old favorite Saratoga
Snacks, owned by National Football League Hall of Fame coach
 Bill Parcells , captured the $250,000 Empire Classic Handicap for
New York-bred horses at Belmont Park.  Saratoga Snacks, running third in the early part of the
race yesterday, swept three wide to take the lead at the turn
and cross the finish line three-quarters of a length ahead of
challenger Bigger Is Bettor. Moneyinyour Pocket was third.  Ridden by jockey Joel Rosario, Saratoga Snacks covered the
1 1/8 miles in one minute, 48.79 seconds.  “I told Bill he was doing even better now than he was last
year,” trainer Gary Sciacca said. “Once I put the glue-on
shoes on the horse it made all the difference in the world. He
started doing good. When they turned for home, I never screamed
like I screamed today.”  Saratoga Snacks, the 3-2 favorite to return $5 on a $2 win
bet, was unraced since Aug. 1 following two starts this year. He
earned $150,000 toward his total winnings of $464,600. The
thoroughbred’s career record is 7-2-1 in 10 starts.  Parcells, whose horses run under the stable name August
Dawn Farm, watched the race from  Florida , Sciacca said.  To contact the reporter on this story:
