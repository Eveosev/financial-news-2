Former U.S. Vice President  Dick Cheney  said the implanted defibrillator that helped keep him
alive in 2007 had its wireless feature disabled because he
feared terrorists could use it to kill him.  “It seemed to me to be a bad idea for the vice president
to have a device that maybe somebody on a rope line or in the
next hotel room or downstairs might be able to get into, hack
into,” Cheney said on CBS’s “60 Minutes” program airing
today. “I worried that someone could kill you.”  A similar scenario was later used as a scene from the
Showtime television drama “Homeland.” Cheney said the scene
was “credible” and an “accurate portrayal of what was
possible.” Cheney was on CBS to promote his new book “Heart:
An American Medical Odyssey,” co-written with his cardiologist
Jonathan Reiner.  Cheney, 72, has had five heart attacks -- his fourth was
during the 2000 presidential recount -- and underwent numerous
medical procedures including quadruple bypass and the
defibrillator implanted before he received a heart transplant
last year.  With the heart transplant, which he called “a miracle,”
Cheney said he is able to fish, hunt and spend time with his
granddaughter. He said he doesn’t ski, though -- “but that’s
because of my knees, not my heart.”  To contact the reporter on this story:
