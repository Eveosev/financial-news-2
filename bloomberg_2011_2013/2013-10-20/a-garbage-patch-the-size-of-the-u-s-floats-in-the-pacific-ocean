The good news is that The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is not a literal island—in fact, the debris concentration is low enough that it’s effectively invisible from the air. But the bad news is bad enough: it’s a vortex of trash roughly twice the size of the continental United States, floating between Hawaii and California. And it’s getting bigger. The fact that much of the Pacific Ocean's plastic pollution is clumping together into one giant garbage pile may seem surprising, but it's actually what scientists had predicted. The "gyre" (rotating current) of the Pacific Ocean leaves a fairly stable region in the center. Surface currents push the trash toward the center of the stationary region, where it gets trapped. Though the debris of the garbage patch may be visible in some areas, in most places the plastic pollution has been degraded by sunlight into small, confetti-like pieces which just below just the surface. There are probably about 3.5 million tons of trash in the patch, most of which floated down rivers to the sea and then took months or even years to reach the center of the North Pacific Gyre. But the patch is so huge that that's only 28 pounds of garbage or so per square mile. Unfortunately, that's enough to cause trouble. Sea turtles can mistake large plastic debris for the jellyfish they live off of—and big pieces of plastic can cause fatal blockages when swallowed. Young birds can have the same problem. Other species suffer from high concentrations of plastic toxins in their tissues, a problem that can get passed all the way up the food chain to us. The plastic concentration has increased by two orders of magnitude since measurements were first taken—in other words, the problem has gotten one hundred times worse since 1972. If this trend continues, the plastic will soon be more common than fish in the area, and that could change the ecosystem of the open sea for good. Or at least until someone invents a foolproof way to take out the trash. More from  Condé Nast Traveler :
