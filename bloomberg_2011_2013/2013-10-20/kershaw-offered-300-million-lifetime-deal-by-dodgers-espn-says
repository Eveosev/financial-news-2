Left-handed pitcher  Clayton Kershaw 
was offered a $300 million lifetime contract earlier this season
by the Los Angeles Dodgers, ESPN reported, citing a person
familiar with the talks.  Kershaw didn’t close the deal out of concern for the
lifetime length of the contract, ESPN said, adding the pitcher
also didn’t want to negotiate during the season.  The contract may be completed this winter with a portion of
his salary going to Kershaw’s charity, ESPN said.  Kershaw, 25, who led Major League Baseball with a 1.83
earned-run average during the regular season, was the losing
pitcher in two games of the 2013 National League Championship
Series. He gave up seven earned runs in Game 6, which the  St.
Louis Cardinals  won 9-0 to reach the  World Series .  In 184 games, Kershaw, the 2011 NL Cy Young Award winner,
is 77-46 with a 2.60 ERA.  To contact the reporter on this story:
