The Obama administration promised a
“tech surge” to fix its online health-insurance market, in a
blog post that said the website “has not lived up to the
expectations of the American people.”  “Our team is bringing in some of the best and brightest
from both inside and outside government to scrub in with the
team and help improve healthcare.gov,” according to the
unsigned post, which went up today on the website of the  U.S.
Department of Health  and Human Services. “We’re also putting in
place tools and processes to aggressively monitor and identify
parts of healthcare.gov where individuals are encountering
errors or having difficulty using the site.”  The online exchange, serving 36 states, is at the heart of
efforts to expand coverage to the uninsured under the Patient
Protection and Affordable Care Act. It opened to customers Oct.
1, and immediately ran into crippling technical problems that
have kept millions from searching for coverage.  To contact the reporter on this story:
