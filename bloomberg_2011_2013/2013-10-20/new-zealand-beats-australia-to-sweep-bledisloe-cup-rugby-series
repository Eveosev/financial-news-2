New Zealand beat  Australia  41-33 to
sweep their three-match Bledisloe Cup rugby series in the teams’
final game before touring the northern hemisphere.  Julian Savea, Sam Cane, Aaron Cruden and Kieran Read
touched down as the top-ranked All Blacks outscored the
Wallabies by four tries to three at Forsyth Barr Stadium in
Dunedin two days ago. Cruden also kicked three conversions and
four penalties.  New Zealand, which won both games between the neighboring
nations in the 2013 Rugby Championship to secure the Bledisloe
Cup for the 11th straight year, last swept the annual series
against Australia in 2009.  Australia came back from 11 points down at halftime to get
to within 33-26, but Read’s try finished off the threat.  The All Blacks next face  Japan  on Nov. 2 in Tokyo before
playing France,  England  and Ireland on successive Saturdays.
Australia, which got tries by Adam Ashley-Cooper, Tevita
Kuridrani and Matt Toomua, open their European tour in two weeks
against England and then face Italy, Ireland,  Scotland  and
Wales.  To contact the reporters on this story:
