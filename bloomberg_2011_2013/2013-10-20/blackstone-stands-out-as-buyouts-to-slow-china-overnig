The rally that’s sent Chinese stocks
listed in New York to a two-year high is also signaling a
slowdown in takeovers.  The gap between buyout offers made by potential suitors and
the share prices of the target companies dropped to 20 percent
last quarter, the smallest premium since 2010, from 31 percent
in the April-to-June period and 39 percent in 2012, data
compiled by Bloomberg show.  The shrinking price differential means there’s less
incentive for Chinese companies to entertain takeover offers
like the one  Blackstone Group LP (BX)  made for  Pactera Technology
International Ltd. (PACT)  last week, curbing deals after they soared to
a record in 2012, according to Mark Tobin, managing partner at
Tobin Tao & Company. The Bloomberg China-US Equity Index of U.S.
listed Chinese stocks fell from the highest level since 2011.  “We would expect further slowing in buyout activity,”
said Tobin, whose advisory firm follows Chinese stocks listed in
the U.S., in a phone interview from Orange County,  California ,
on Oct. 18. “There are simply less candidates, along with the
improved stock performance encouraging companies to maintain
their listings.”  Chinese companies have sought buyout deals to withdraw from
U.S. listing since 2011 as concerns over corporate governance
and the quality of their accounting pushed down share prices and
depressed valuations. The go-private deals increased to a record
19 last year, from 14 in 2011 and five in 2010. So far this
year, 13 deals have been announced.  Pactera, RDA  Pactera, a provider of technology outsourcing services
based in Dalian,  China , jumped 8.1 percent on Oct. 17 after it
accepted an offer of $7.30 per American depositary receipt from
the Blackstone-led consortium.  The deal represented a 39 percent premium over the closing
price on May 17, the last trading day when an initial offer of
$7.50 was announced.  RDA Microelectronics Inc., a Shanghai-based maker of
semiconductor components, received a non-binding takeover
proposal Sept. 27 from state-owned Shanghai Pudong Science and
Technology Investment Co. for $15.50 each ADR, which was a 12
percent premium to the previous day’s closing level. The deal is
valued $625 million.  The buyout group is unlikely to raise the offer for RDA,
 Jay Srivatsa , an analyst at Chardan Capital Markets LLC wrote in
a note Oct. 17, after RDA said it will miss third-quarter sales
forecast by as much as 27 percent.  Faster Growth  Other proposals announced during the quarter include a $326
million offer to buy China Hydroelectric Corp and a $28 million
deal for Charm Communications Inc., a digital advertising
company based in Beijing.  The Bloomberg China index lost 1.1 percent to 105.98 at
11:34 a.m. in New York. The measure gained 2.3 percent last
week, led by NQ Mobile Inc. and Baidu Inc.  China’s gross domestic product rose 7.8 percent in the
July-September period from a year earlier, the fastest expansion
since December, the National Bureau of Statistics said in
Beijing on Oct. 18.  To contact the reporters on this story:
