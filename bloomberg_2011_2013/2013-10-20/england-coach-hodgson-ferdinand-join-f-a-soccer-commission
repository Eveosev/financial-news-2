England coach  Roy Hodgson  and former
captain  Rio Ferdinand  have joined the Football Association’s
commission seeking ways to improve the national team.  The body was set up by incoming F.A. Chairman Greg Dyke.
The composition of the original eight-man panel had come under
criticism for not reflecting the diversity of English society.  F.A. board member Heather Rabbatts said the commission’s
all white-male membership was “letting down so many black and
ethnic minority people -- players, ex-players, coaches and
volunteers, who have so much to offer and are so often
discouraged and disheartened by the attitudes they encounter.”  The F.A. announced the appointment of Hodgson and Ferdinand
 on its website .  “As a current player with forthright views and opinions on
the game, we can look forward to Rio providing significant
insight and experience,” Dyke was cited as saying.  “It is important Roy can offer his views as the current
manager of the national team and share the knowledge he has
gained when working for many years in a number of countries,”
Dyke added.  To contact the editor responsible for this story:
